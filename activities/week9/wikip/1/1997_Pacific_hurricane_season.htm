It was one of the most active seasons. With hundreds of deaths and billions of dollars in damage, this season was the costliest and one of the deadliest <!--del_lnk--> Pacific hurricane seasons.</p>
       <p>Hurricanes Linda, Pauline, and Nora were the most notable storms in 1997. <!--del_lnk--> Linda became the most intense east Pacific hurricane in recorded history. <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Pauline killed several hundred people in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> due to heavy flooding, while <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Nora caused flooding and damage in the <!--del_lnk--> Southwestern United States. In addition, Super Typhoons Oliwa and <!--del_lnk--> Paka originated in region before crossing the International Date Line and causing significant damage in the western Pacific.</p>

       <p>The 1997 Pacific hurricane season officially started on <!--del_lnk--> May 15, <a href="../../wp/1/1997.htm" title="1997">1997</a> in the eastern Pacific, and on <!--del_lnk--> June 1, <a href="../../wp/1/1997.htm" title="1997">1997</a> in the central Pacific, and lasted until <!--del_lnk--> November 30, <a href="../../wp/1/1997.htm" title="1997">1997</a>. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. This season exceeded these boundaries appreciably, as Tropical Storm Paka formed <!--del_lnk--> December 2, and dissipated nineteen days later after moving into the Western Pacific.</p>
       <p>The 1997 Pacific hurricane season was fairly active, due to the strong <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/El_Ni%25C3%25B1o%25E2%2580%2593Southern_Oscillation.htm" title="El Ni&ntilde;o">El Ni&ntilde;o</a> that was occurring at the time. El Ni&ntilde;o causes wind shear to be reduced and water temperatures to increase, resulting in conditions more favourable for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific.</p>
       <p>There were 24 cyclones in total, including five unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific (east of 140&deg; W). Of these, eight peaked at tropical storm intensity, while ten reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category 3 intensity or higher on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, including Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka, which became typhoons after crossing into the western Pacific.</p>
       <p>Activity in the central Pacific was also above average. Two tropical storms formed, as did several tropical depressions. A number of storms moved in from the east. With a total of nine tropical cyclones entering or forming there, this was the fourth highest number since satellite observations began.</p>
       <p>The first storm formed on <!--del_lnk--> June 1. The last storm dissipated <!--del_lnk--> December 21, which gives this season the latest known end. However, if <!--del_lnk--> December 6, the date the last storm crossed the dateline is taken to be the end, this season has the second latest end, behind the <!--del_lnk--> 1983 season and tied with <!--del_lnk--> 1957 season.</p>

       <p>Andres originated as a disturbance that had slowly organized formed into Tropical Depression One-E on <!--del_lnk--> June 1. The next day, it reached tropical storm status. After a brief period of a normal track to the northwest, Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten <a href="../../wp/c/Central_America.htm" title="Central America">Central America</a>. Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time since record-keeping began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres then turned back to the northeast. It weakened to a depression and made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> San Salvador on <!--del_lnk--> June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter.</p>
       <p>Among the casualties were two fishers who were reported missing. <!--del_lnk--> Power outages, flooding rivers, several <!--del_lnk--> car crashes, and damage to roughly ten homes was attributed to Andres. The highest rainfall report from <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> was 11.42 inches (290&nbsp;mm) at Mazatan. Damage was noted in parts of <a href="../../wp/n/Nicaragua.htm" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>. Andres also killed four people in the <!--del_lnk--> Usulatan province due to heavy flooding.</p>

       <p>Blanca was a short-lived tropical storm that briefly threatened land. Tropical Depression Two-E formed <!--del_lnk--> June 9 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Blanca six hours later. It moved northwest and briefly threatened land on <!--del_lnk--> June 10 as <!--del_lnk--> warnings and watches were established by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Servicio Meteorol&oacute;gico Nacional</i>. Then, a ridge of high pressure turned Blanca away from the coast.</p>
       <p>Despite moving over warm waters, a weakening trend unexpectedly began, and Blanca was downgraded to a depression. and Blanca lost its circulation shortly after being downgraded on <!--del_lnk--> June 12.</p>
       <p>Rains from Blanca were significant. There was no damage or casualties as Blanca's impact was generally minimal.</p>

       <p>Tropical Storm Ignacio formed first as a depression in an area of disturbed weather on <!--del_lnk--> August 17. 12 hours later, it organized into a tropical storm. Ignacio's location of tropical cyclogenesis was further north and west of where most East Pacific tropical cyclones form. Steering currents pulled Ignacio north, where it encountered wind shear and cooler waters. Ignacio lost tropical characteristics <!--del_lnk--> August 19. The remnants moved north, bringing gusty winds to California coastal waters before dissipating. They were then absorbed by the same cyclone that absorbed the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo. It caused rainfall as far north as the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. state of <!--del_lnk--> Washington.</p>

       <p>The next hurricane of the season, Jimena, had a very rapid intensification and an equally rapid decay. Tropical Depression Twelve-E formed <!--del_lnk--> August 25 from an area of disturbed weather in a rather easterly location. It became a tropical storm the next day and a hurricane on <!--del_lnk--> August 27. Intensification was rapid, with winds increasing from 65 to 115 knots (120 to 215 km/h) in the space of 12 to 15 hours.</p>
       <p>It moved north-northwest and encountered an upper level trough. This caused very heavy wind shear which reduced its winds from 115 to 30 knots (215 to 60 km/h) in the space of a day.

       <p>Hurricane Rick was the first case of November <!--del_lnk--> tropical cyclogenesis in this basin since the <!--del_lnk--> 1991 season. A <!--del_lnk--> tropical wave acquired enough organization to be called a tropical depression on <!--del_lnk--> November 7. It moved north before a trough of <!--del_lnk--> low pressure turned it to the northeast. It was named on <!--del_lnk--> November 8, and was upgraded to a hurricane the next day. It reached its peak intensity of 80 knots (160 km/h) and 973 mbar (973 hPa) <!--del_lnk--> November 9. Rick made landfall in <!--del_lnk--> Oaxaca &ndash; the same area devastated by Hurricane Pauline one month earlier &ndash; and quickly weakened, dissipating early <!--del_lnk--> November 11.</p>
       <p>The storm downed trees, washed out recently repaired roads, and disrupted communications in some small population centers. A total of 10.47 inches (266&nbsp;mm) of rain was reported at Astata/San Pedro Huameluca near the point of landfall in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.

       <p>Rick is one of only seven known hurricanes to form in the Pacific Ocean east of the dateline in the month of November. The other ones are <!--del_lnk--> Nina, <!--del_lnk--> Ruby, <!--del_lnk--> Iwa, <!--del_lnk--> Winnie, 1991's Nora, and <!--del_lnk--> 2006's Sergio, of which only Rick directly impacted land.

       <p>Tropical Depression Five-C formed on <!--del_lnk--> December 2, two days after the season ended. It was the second December tropical depression east of the dateline; <!--del_lnk--> 1983's Hurricane Winnie was the only other one. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Paka (<!--del_lnk--> Hawaiian for Pat) while west of <a href="../../wp/p/Palmyra_Atoll.htm" title="Palmyra Atoll">Palmyra Atoll</a>. The system began to move westward at a steady pace. As Paka moved westward, dry air and wind shear disrupted its development until it crossed the dateline on <!--del_lnk--> December 6.</p>
       <p>After entering the Western Pacific, the cyclone encountered a more favorable environment, resulting in Paka's rapid intensification. It became a typhoon on <!--del_lnk--> December 10 and passed near <!--del_lnk--> Kwajalein with winds of 100 knots (190 km/h). It strengthened further, twice reaching Category 5 intensity. While a Category 4 storm, Paka passed close to <a href="../../wp/g/Guam.htm" title="Guam">Guam</a> on <!--del_lnk--> December 17, causing "major damage". Afterwards, Paka encountered a hostile environment and completely dissipated by the evening of <!--del_lnk--> December 22.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_storms">Other storms</span></h3>
       <p>In addition to the named storms, there were also five tropical depressions that did not reach storm strength. Two of the depressions were in the eastern Pacific while three formed in the central Pacific. None of them threatened land.</p>
       <p>Tropical Depression Three-E formed <!--del_lnk--> June 21. Moving rapidly westward, it never strengthened and dissipated early on <!--del_lnk--> June 24. Several days later, on <!--del_lnk--> June 29, Five-E formed at midday and erratically moved to the west. After slowing down greatly, the depression dissipated on <!--del_lnk--> July 4.</p>
       <p>Tropical Depression One-C formed on <!--del_lnk--> July 26 from a disturbance that had been showing signs of development for three days. It moved west to southwest through an unfavorable environment. On the morning of <!--del_lnk--> July 27, it was destroyed by wind shear caused by an upper-level <!--del_lnk--> trough. Tropical Depression Three-C was formed when a tropical disturbance organized into a depression on <!--del_lnk--> October 6. It moved slowly moved westward without intensifying, and dissipated the next day. Nearly a month later, Tropical Depression Four-C formed at night on <!--del_lnk--> October 30 and in a similar location to where One-C formed. Moving westward, it weakened gradually when it encountered a large <!--del_lnk--> mass of dry air, and dissipated late on <!--del_lnk--> October 31.</p>

       <p>The season began with the formation of Tropical Depression One-E on <!--del_lnk--> June 1 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Paka on <!--del_lnk--> December 22. The season can alternatively be considered to end on <!--del_lnk--> December 6, the day Tropical Storm Paka crossed the <!--del_lnk--> international dateline. No named storms formed in May, three in June, four in July, four in August, five in September, one in October, and one in November. Very unusually, a tropical storm formed in December, after the season ended. The only other time this happened since the <!--del_lnk--> satellite era began was in <!--del_lnk--> 1983.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is a measure of how active a hurricane season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 10<sup>4</sup>. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. It was not as strong as that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher ACE level. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three <!--del_lnk--> significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140&deg;W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140&deg;W) is given in brackets.</p>
       <p>The table includes the ACE for Oliwa and Paka only during those storm's time east of the dateline. Their ACE west of the dateline is part of the totals of the <!--del_lnk--> 1997 typhoon season.</p>
       <p>The Nation Hurricane Centre uses ACE to rank hurricane seasons as above-normal, near-normal, and below-normal. It defines below-normal as having an ACE less than 95*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup> kt<sup>2</sup>; It defines above normal as having an ACE above 150*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup> along with the numbers of any two of the following above average: tropical storms (15), hurricanes (9), or major hurricanes (4); It defines near-normal as having an ACE between 100*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup> and 150*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup>, or an ACE above 150*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup> with fewer than two of the numbers of the following above average: tropical storms (15), hurricanes (9), or major hurricanes (4).</p>
       <p>This season has a total of 17 tropical storms, 9 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes. The total ACE of this season is 160*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup> in the east Pacific proper. This qualifies this season as above-normal. As of the start of the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 season, it is the most recent above-normal season.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Storm_names">Storm names</span></h2>
       <p>The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1997. Names that were not assigned are marked in <font color="gray">gray</font>. The names not retired from this list were used again in the <!--del_lnk--> 2003 season. This is the same list used for the <!--del_lnk--> 1991 season except for Felicia, which replaced <!--del_lnk--> Fefa. A storm was named Felicia for the first time in 1997. Also, the name "Dolores" was misspelled "Delores" in the 1991 season; in this and subsequent seasons, the typo was corrected.</p>
