       <p>The <b>Okeechobee Hurricane</b>, or <b>Hurricane San Felipe Segundo</b>, was a deadly <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">hurricane</a> that struck the <!--del_lnk--> Leeward Islands, <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, and <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> in September of the <!--del_lnk--> 1928 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the first recorded hurricane to reach Category 5 status on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic basin">Atlantic basin</a>; as of 2006, it remains the only recorded hurricane to strike Puerto Rico at Category 5 strength, and one of the ten most intense ever recorded to make landfall in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
       <p>The hurricane caused devastation throughout its path. As many as 1,200 people were killed in <a href="../../wp/g/Guadeloupe.htm" title="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>. The storm directly struck Puerto Rico at peak strength, killing at least 300 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. In south Florida at least 2,500 were killed when storm surge from <!--del_lnk--> Lake Okeechobee breached the dike surrounding the lake, flooding an area covering hundreds of square miles. In total, the hurricane killed at least 4,078 people and caused around $100 million ($1 billion 2006 <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="US dollars">US dollars</a>) in damages over the course of its path.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The storm was first observed 900 miles (1450 km) to the east of <a href="../../wp/g/Guadeloupe.htm" title="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> on <!--del_lnk--> September 10 by the <i>S.S. Commack</i>. At the time, this was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship's radio. A <!--del_lnk--> Cape Verde-type hurricane, hurricane analysis in the 1990s determined the storm likely formed four days prior between the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cape_Verde.htm" title="Cape Verde Islands">Cape Verde Islands</a> and the coast of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>.</p>
       <p>As the storm neared the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean, it was already a <!--del_lnk--> Category 3 hurricane. On <!--del_lnk--> September 12 it passed over <a href="../../wp/g/Guadeloupe.htm" title="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> and then south of the other <!--del_lnk--> Leeward Islands; Guadeloupe reported a pressure of 27.76&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> inHg (940&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mbar), and a ship just south of <!--del_lnk--> St. Croix in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Virgin_Islands.htm" title="United States Virgin Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a> reported it as an even stronger storm with a pressure of 27.50&nbsp;inHg (931&nbsp;mbar). On the 13th the storm struck <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> directly as a <!--del_lnk--> Category 5 hurricane, allegedly packing winds of 160&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mph (260 <!--del_lnk--> km/h); reliable reports from <!--del_lnk--> San Juan placed the wind speed at 125&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> knots (145&nbsp;mph, 230&nbsp;km/h), and a report from <!--del_lnk--> Guayama placed the pressure at 27.65&nbsp;inHg (936&nbsp;mbar).</p>
       <p>The 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h) wind measurement from Puerto Rico was taken by a cup <!--del_lnk--> anemometer in <!--del_lnk--> San Juan, 30&nbsp;miles (50&nbsp;km) north of the storm's centre, which measured 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h) sustained winds three hours before the peak wind speed was reached; however, the instrument was destroyed soon after and could not be calibrated. This unverified reading was the strongest wind measurement ever reported for an <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic hurricane up until that time; not until <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Dog of 1950 were stronger winds officially measured in an Atlantic storm, although some unmeasured storms like the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/1/1935_Labor_Day_hurricane.htm" title="Labor Day Hurricane of 1935">1935 Labor Day Hurricane</a> may have been stronger. Because of this measurement, the Okeechobee storm is considered to be the first hurricane in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic basin">Atlantic basin</a> ever to reach Category 5 intensity, the highest possible rating on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; although it is virtually certain that earlier hurricanes had achieved this strength (a likely candidate is the <!--del_lnk--> Great Havana Hurricane of 1846), none had ever had their winds or pressure recorded properly.</p>
       <p>The hurricane was also extremely large as it crossed Puerto Rico. Hurricane-force winds were measured in <!--del_lnk--> Guayama for 18 hours; since the storm is estimated to have been moving at 13&nbsp;mph (21&nbsp;km/h), the diameter of the storm's hurricane winds was estimated very roughly to be 234&nbsp;miles (376&nbsp;km).</p>
       <p>After leaving the Caribbean, the hurricane moved across the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> as a strong <!--del_lnk--> Category 4 hurricane. It continued to the west-northwest, and made landfall in southern <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> on the evening of <!--del_lnk--> September 16 (or early on September 17 <!--del_lnk--> Universal Time). Atmospheric pressure at landfall was measured at 929&nbsp;mbar (hPa) and maximum sustained winds near 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). The eye passed ashore in <!--del_lnk--> Palm Beach County near <!--del_lnk--> West Palm Beach, then moved directly over <!--del_lnk--> Lake Okeechobee. Peak gusts were estimated near 160 mph (260 km/h) at <!--del_lnk--> Canal Point, Florida.</p>
       <p>The hurricane's path turned northeast as it crossed Florida, taking it across northern Florida, eastern <!--del_lnk--> Georgia, and the <!--del_lnk--> Carolinas on <!--del_lnk--> September 19. It then moved inland and merged with a low-pressure system around <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Toronto.htm" title="Toronto, Canada">Toronto</a> on the 20th.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Leeward_Islands">Leeward Islands</span></h3>
       <p>The hurricane moved directly over the <!--del_lnk--> Leeward Islands in the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean, strengthening as it did so. On the island of <a href="../../wp/d/Dominica.htm" title="Dominica">Dominica</a> winds were clocked at 24 mph (39 km/h); there were no reports of damages. In <a href="../../wp/m/Martinique.htm" title="Martinique">Martinique</a>, even further south of the storm's path, there were three fatalities. <a href="../../wp/g/Guadeloupe.htm" title="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> received a near-direct hit from the storm, apparently with little warning; the death toll there was 600&ndash;1200, and damage reports relayed through <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> indicated "great destruction" on the island. <a href="../../wp/m/Montserrat.htm" title="Montserrat">Montserrat</a>, just north of the storm's centre, was warned in advance of the storm but still suffered &pound;150,000 (1928 <!--del_lnk--> UKP) in damages and 42 deaths; <!--del_lnk--> Plymouth and <!--del_lnk--> Salem were devastated and crop losses caused near-starvation conditions before relief could arrive. The storm passed to the south of the islands of <!--del_lnk--> St. Kitts and <!--del_lnk--> St. Croix, which suffered heavy damages to property and crops but no reported fatalities. <!--del_lnk--> Nevis did report three deaths due to the storm, though. Damage reports from elsewhere in the Leeward Islands are not available.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Puerto_Rico">Puerto Rico</span></h3>
       <p>The island of <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> received the worst of the storm's winds when the hurricane moved directly across the island at <!--del_lnk--> Category 5 strength. The island knew of the storm's approach well ahead of time; by about 36 hours in advance all police districts were warned and radio broadcasts provided constant warnings to ships. Effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312, and amazingly not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. By comparison, the weaker <!--del_lnk--> 1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco killed approximately 3,000 people.</p>
       <p>Property damage on the island from winds and rain, however, was catastrophic. The northeast half of the island received winds in excess of Category 3 strength, with hurricane-force winds lasting for as long as 18 hours. At least 10 inches (250 mm) of rain was dropped over the entire island, with much greater amounts of nearly 30 inches (750 mm) being received in some areas. Official reports stated that "several hundred thousand" people were left homeless, and property damages were estimated at $50&nbsp;million ($400 million in 2005 <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="US dollars">US dollars</a>).</p>
       <p>The storm is remembered in Puerto Rico (and Latin America) as the <!--del_lnk--> San Felipe Hurricane because the eye of the cyclone made landfall on the <!--del_lnk--> Christian feast day of <!--del_lnk--> Saint Philip; the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> custom, since the Spanish colonial era began in 1492, was to name hurricanes upon their arrival after Catholic religious feast days. It was named "Segundo", Spanish for "the Second", because of another destructive "Hurricane San Felipe" which struck Puerto Rico on that very same day 52 years earlier.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bahamas">Bahamas</span></h3>
       <p>The eye of the hurricane passed just south of <!--del_lnk--> Grand Bahama as a strong <!--del_lnk--> Category 4 hurricane, again causing very heavy damage. According to a firsthand account from the island, it was the worst storm in memory to strike the area. As in Puerto Rico, however, authorities in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> were aware of the hurricane's passage well ahead of time, and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands. The only report of fatalities was from a <!--del_lnk--> sloop lost at sea in the vicinity of <!--del_lnk--> Ambergris Cay with 18 on board.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="South_Florida">South Florida</span></h3>
       <p>Coastal damage in Florida near the point of landfall was catastrophic. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Miami.htm" title="Miami, Florida">Miami</a>, well south of the point of landfall, escaped with very little damage; <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood and <!--del_lnk--> Fort Lauderdale suffered only slight damages. Northward, from <!--del_lnk--> Pompano Beach to <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter, buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and 10 ft (3 m) storm surge, which was heaviest in the vicinity of <!--del_lnk--> Palm Beach; total coastal damages were estimated as "several million" dollars. Because of well-issued hurricane warnings, residents were prepared for the storm, and the loss of life in the coastal Palm Beach area was only 26.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Inland, the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of <!--del_lnk--> Lake Okeechobee. Residents had been warned to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day, but after the hurricane did not arrive on schedule, many thought it had missed and returned to their homes. When the worst of the storm crossed the lake &mdash; with winds measured on the ground at around 140&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mph (225&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km/h) &mdash; the south-blowing wind caused a <!--del_lnk--> storm surge to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake. The resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over 20&nbsp;ft (6&nbsp;m) deep. Houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered. Most survivors and bodies were washed out into the <!--del_lnk--> Everglades where many of the bodies were never found. As the rear <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Eye_%2528cyclone%2529.htm" title="Eyewall">eyewall</a> passed over the area, the flood reversed itself, breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing a similar but smaller flood.</p>
       <div class="thumb tright">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:252px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/241/24167.png.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="239" src="../../images/241/24167.png"  width="250" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Floodwaters persisted for several weeks, greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation. Burial services were quickly overwhelmed, and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves. Around 75% of the fatalities were migrant farm workers, making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult; as a result of this, the count of the dead is not very accurate. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement.htm" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> estimated the number of fatalities as 1,836, which was taken as the official count by the <!--del_lnk--> National Weather Service for many years; older sources usually list 3,411 as the hurricane's total count of fatalities, including the Caribbean. However, in 2003 the U.S. death count was revised as "at least" 2,500, making the Okeechobee hurricane the second-deadliest natural disaster in <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> history behind the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/1/1900_Galveston_hurricane.htm" title="Galveston Hurricane of 1900">Galveston Hurricane of 1900</a>. A mass grave at the Port Mayaca Cemetery east of <!--del_lnk--> Port Mayaca contains the bodies of 1,600 victims of the hurricane.</p>
       <p>Thousands of people were left homeless in Florida; property damage was estimated at $25&nbsp;million ($200 million in 2005 <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="US dollars">US dollars</a>). It is estimated that if a storm like this were to strike in modern times (the year 2003), it would cause $18.7&nbsp;billion in damages. However, a levee breach of this kind is unlikely to occur again because of the much larger <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Hoover Dike that now contains the waters of Lake Okeechobee.</p>
       <p>The cyclone remains one of only three Atlantic hurricanes to strike the southern mainland of Florida with a central pressure below 940 mbar (27.76 inHg), the others being the <!--del_lnk--> 1926 Miami hurricane and <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Andrew.htm" title="Hurricane Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a> of <!--del_lnk--> 1992.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Southeast_and_Mid-Atlantic">Southeast and Mid-Atlantic</span></h3>
       <p>Limited damage reports are available for the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> outside of southern Florida. The storm caused flooding in <!--del_lnk--> North Carolina and brought near-hurricane-force winds and a 7&nbsp;foot (2.1&nbsp;m) storm surge to the <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk area. Nonetheless, most sources agree that the hurricane caused only minimal damage in these areas.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Racial_issues">Racial issues</span></h3>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>, although the hurricane destroyed everything in its path with impartiality, the death toll was by far highest in the economically poor areas in the low-lying ground right around <!--del_lnk--> Lake Okeechobee. Around 75% of the fatalities were from migrant farm workers, most of whom were black. Black workers did most of the cleanup, and the few caskets available for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites; other bodies were either burned or buried in mass graves. Burials were segregated, and the only mass gravesite to receive a memorial contained only white bodies. The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction that still exists. The effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers is dramatized in <!--del_lnk--> Zora Neale Hurston's novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Their Eyes Were Watching God</i></p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Improved_building_codes">Improved building codes</span></h3>
       <p>In the aftermath of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. Coming on the heels of the <!--del_lnk--> 1926 Miami Hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes throughout south Florida. The result is that later storms of similar intensity, such as the <!--del_lnk--> 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane, caused substantially less damage than the hurricanes of the 1920s.</p>
