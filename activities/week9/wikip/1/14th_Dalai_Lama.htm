       <p>The <b>14th Dalai Lama</b> (<!--del_lnk--> religious name: <b>Tenzin Gyatso</b>, shortened from <b>Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso</b>, born <b>Lhamo Dondrub</b>, 6 July 1935) is the 14th and current <a href="../../wp/d/Dalai_Lama.htm" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a>, as well as the longest lived incumbent. Dalai Lamas are the head <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Monk.htm" title="Monks">monks</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Gelugpa lineage of <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism. He won the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1989, and is also well known for his lifelong advocacy for Tibetans inside and outside Tibet.</p>
       <p>The Dalai Lama was born in <!--del_lnk--> Taktser, <!--del_lnk--> Qinghai (also known to Tibetans as <!--del_lnk--> Amdo), and was selected as the <!--del_lnk--> rebirth of the <!--del_lnk--> 13th Dalai Lama two years later, although he was only formally recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama on 17 November 1950, at the age of 15. The <!--del_lnk--> Gelug school's government administered an area roughly corresponding to the <!--del_lnk--> Tibet Autonomous Region just as the nascent <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> wished to assert central control over it. There is a dispute over whether the respective governments reached <!--del_lnk--> an agreement for a joint Chinese-Tibetan administration.</p>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> 1959 Tibetan uprising, which China regards as an uprising of <!--del_lnk--> feudal landlords, the Dalai Lama, who regards the uprising as an expression of widespread discontent, fled to <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, where he denounced the People's Republic and established a <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan government in exile. He has since traveled the world, advocating for the welfare of Tibetans, teaching Tibetan Buddhism and talking about the importance of compassion as the source of a happy life. Around the world, institutions face pressure from China not to accept him. He has spoken about the <!--del_lnk--> environment, <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Women%2527s_rights.htm" title="Women rights">women rights</a>, <!--del_lnk--> non-violence, <!--del_lnk--> interfaith dialog, <!--del_lnk--> reproductive health, <!--del_lnk--> sexuality along with various <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana and <!--del_lnk--> Vajrayana topics.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Lhamo D&ouml;ndrub (or <i>Thondup</i>) was born on 6 July 1935 to a farming and horse trading family in the small hamlet of <!--del_lnk--> Taktser, in the eastern border of the former Tibetan region of <!--del_lnk--> Amdo, then already assimilated into the Chinese province of <!--del_lnk--> Qinghai. He was one of seven siblings to survive childhood. The eldest was his sister Tsering Dolma, eighteen years older. His eldest brother, <!--del_lnk--> Thupten Jigme Norbu, had been recognised at the age of eight as the reincarnation of the high <!--del_lnk--> Lama <!--del_lnk--> Taktser Rinpoche. His sister, <!--del_lnk--> Jetsun Pema, spent most of her adult life on the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Children's Villages project. The Dalai Lama's first language was, in his own words, "a broken <!--del_lnk--> Xining language which was (a dialect of) the <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese language</a>" as his family did not speak <!--del_lnk--> the Tibetan language.</p>
       <p>A search party was sent to locate the new <!--del_lnk--> incarnation when the boy who was to become the 14th was about two years old. It is said that, amongst other omens, the head of the embalmed body of the <!--del_lnk--> thirteenth Dalai Lama, at first facing south-east, had mysteriously turned to face the northeast&mdash;indicating the direction in which his successor would be found. The <!--del_lnk--> Regent, <!--del_lnk--> Reting Rinpoche, shortly afterwards had a <!--del_lnk--> vision at the sacred lake of <!--del_lnk--> Lhamo La-tso indicating Amdo as the region to search&mdash;specifically a one-story house with distinctive guttering and tiling. After extensive searching, the Thondup house, with its features resembling those in Reting's vision, was finally found.</p>
       <p>Thondup was presented with various <!--del_lnk--> relics, including toys, some of which had belonged to the <!--del_lnk--> 13th Dalai Lama and some of which had not. It was reported that he had correctly identified all the items owned by the previous Dalai Lama, exclaiming, "That's mine! That's mine!"</p>

       <p>The Chinese Muslim General <!--del_lnk--> Ma Bufang did not want the 14th Dalai Lama to succeed his predecessor. Ma Bufang stationed his men to place the Dalai Lama under effective house arrest, saying it was needed for "protection", refusing to permit his leaving to Tibet. He did all he could to delay the transport of the Dalai Lama from Qinghai to Tibet, by demanding massive sums of money in silver. The demanded payment by Ma Bufang was 100,000 Chinese silver dollars.</p>
       <p>Lhamo Thondup was recognised formally as the reincarnated Dalai Lama and renamed <b>Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso</b> (<i>Holy Lord, Gentle Glory, Compassionate, Defender of the Faith, Ocean of Wisdom</i>) although he was not formally enthroned as the Dalai Lama until the age of 15; instead, the <!--del_lnk--> regent acted as the head of the <!--del_lnk--> Kashag until that time. <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhists normally refer to him as Yishin Norbu (<i>Wish-Fulfilling Gem</i>), Kyabgon (<i>Saviour</i>), or just Kundun (<i>Presence</i>). His devotees, as well as much of the Western world, often call him <i>His Holiness the Dalai Lama</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> style employed on the Dalai Lama's website.</p>
       <p>Monastic education commenced at the age of six years, his principal teachers being Yongdzin <!--del_lnk--> Ling Rinpoche (senior tutor) and Yongdzin <!--del_lnk--> Trijang Rinpoche (junior tutor). At the age of 11 he met the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian mountaineer <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Harrer, who became his <!--del_lnk--> videographer and tutor about the world outside <a href="../../wp/l/Lhasa.htm" title="Lhasa">Lhasa</a>. The two remained friends until Harrer's death in 2006.</p>
       <p>In 1959, at the age of 23, he took his final examination at <a href="../../wp/l/Lhasa.htm" title="Lhasa">Lhasa</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> Jokhang Temple during the annual <!--del_lnk--> Monlam or <i>prayer</i> Festival. He passed with honours and was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Lharampa degree, the highest-level <i><!--del_lnk--> geshe</i> degree, roughly equivalent to a doctorate in <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist philosophy.</p>

       <p>Historically the Dalai Lamas had political and religious influence in the Western Tibetan area of <!--del_lnk--> &Uuml;-Tsang around <a href="../../wp/l/Lhasa.htm" title="Lhasa">Lhasa</a>, where the <!--del_lnk--> Gelug school of <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism was popular and the Dalai Lamas held land under their jurisdiction. In 1939, at the age of four, the present Dalai Lama was taken in a procession of lamas to Lhasa.</p>
       <p>The Dalai Lama's childhood was spent between the <!--del_lnk--> Potala Palace and <!--del_lnk--> Norbulingka, his summer residence, both of which are now <a href="../../wp/u/UNESCO.htm" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Sites">World Heritage Sites</a>.</p>
       <p>China asserts that the <!--del_lnk--> Kuomintang government ratified the 14th Dalai Lama and that a Kuomintang representative, General Wu Zhongxin, presided over the ceremony. It cites a ratification order dated February 1940, and a documentary film of the ceremony. According to <!--del_lnk--> Tsering Shakya, Wu Zhongxin along with other foreign representatives was present at the ceremony, but there is no evidence that he presided over it. He also wrote:</p>
       <p><i>"On 8 July 1949, the <!--del_lnk--> Kashag [Tibetan Parliament] called Chen Xizhang, the acting director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission office in Lhasa. He was informed that the Tibetan Government had decided to expel all Chinese connected with the Guomingdang Government. Fearing that the Chinese might organize protests in the streets of Lhasa, the Kashag imposed a curfew until all the Chinese had left. This they did on 14, 17 and 20 July 1949. At the same time the Tibetan Government sent a telegram to General Chiang Kai-shek and to President Li Zongren informing them of the decision."</i></p>
       <p>
        <br /> During his reign, a border crisis erupted with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> in 1942. Under orders from the <!--del_lnk--> Kuomintang government of <!--del_lnk--> Chiang Kai-shek, <!--del_lnk--> Ma Bufang repaired Yushu airport to prevent Tibetan separatists from seeking independence. Chiang also ordered Ma Bufang to put his Muslim soldiers on alert for an invasion of Tibet in 1942. Ma Bufang complied, and moved several thousand troops to the border with Tibet. Chiang also threatened the Tibetans with aerial bombardment if they worked with the Japanese. Ma Bufang attacked the Tibetan Buddhist Tsang monastery in 1941. He also constantly attacked the Labrang monastery.</p>
       <p>In October 1950 the army of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> marched to the edge of the Dalai Lama's territory and sent a delegation after defeating a legion of the Tibetan army in <!--del_lnk--> warlord-controlled <!--del_lnk--> Kham. On 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, the 14th Dalai Lama was enthroned formally as the temporal ruler of Tibet.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cooperation_and_conflicts_with_the_PRC">Cooperation and conflicts with the PRC</span></h3>
       <p>The Dalai Lama's formal rule was brief. He sent a delegation to Beijing, which ratified the <!--del_lnk--> Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. He worked with the Chinese government: in September 1954, together with the <!--del_lnk--> 10th Panchen Lama he went to the Chinese capital to meet <a href="../../wp/m/Mao_Zedong.htm" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> and attend the first session of the <!--del_lnk--> National People's Congress as a delegate, primarily discussing <!--del_lnk--> China's constitution. On 27 September 1954, the Dalai Lama was selected as a deputy chairman of the <!--del_lnk--> Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, a post he officially held until 1964.</p>
       <p>In 1956, on a trip to India to celebrate the <!--del_lnk--> Buddha's Birthday, the Dalai Lama asked the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister of India, <!--del_lnk--> Jawaharlal Nehru, if he would allow him <!--del_lnk--> political asylum should he choose to stay. Nehru discouraged this as a provocation against peace, and reminded him of the Indian Government's <!--del_lnk--> non-interventionist stance agreed upon with its <!--del_lnk--> 1954 treaty with China. The <!--del_lnk--> CIA, with the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War only recently over, offered the Dalai Lama assistance. In 1956, a large rebellion broke out in eastern <!--del_lnk--> Kham, an ethnically Tibetan region in <!--del_lnk--> Sichuan province. To support the rebels, the CIA launched a covert action campaign against the Communist Chinese. A secret military training camp for the Khampa guerrillas was established at <!--del_lnk--> Camp Hale near Leadville, Colorado, in the U.S. The guerrillas attacked Communist forces in <!--del_lnk--> Amdo and Kham but were gradually pushed into <!--del_lnk--> Central Tibet.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Exile_to_India">Exile to India</span></h3>
       <p>At the outset of the <!--del_lnk--> 1959 Tibetan uprising, fearing for his life, the Dalai Lama and his retinue fled Tibet with the help of the CIA's <!--del_lnk--> Special Activities Division, crossing into India on 30 March 1959, reaching <!--del_lnk--> Tezpur in <!--del_lnk--> Assam on 18 April. Some time later he set up the <!--del_lnk--> Government of Tibet in Exile in <!--del_lnk--> Dharamshala, India, which is often referred to as "<i><!--del_lnk--> Little Lhasa</i>". After the founding of the exiled government he re-established the approximately 80,000 Tibetan refugees who followed him into exile in agricultural settlements. He created a Tibetan educational system in order to teach the Tibetan children the <!--del_lnk--> language, <!--del_lnk--> history, <!--del_lnk--> religion, and <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm#Culture" title="Tibet">culture</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts was established in 1959 and the <!--del_lnk--> Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies became the primary university for Tibetans in India. He supported the refounding of 200 monasteries and nunneries in an attempt to preserve Tibetan Buddhist teachings and the Tibetan way of life.</p>
       <p>The Dalai Lama appealed to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> on the rights of Tibetans. This appeal resulted in three resolutions adopted by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_General_Assembly.htm" title="United Nations General Assembly">General Assembly</a> in 1959, 1961, and 1965, all before the People's Republic <!--del_lnk--> was allowed representation at the United Nations. The resolutions called on China to respect the human rights of <!--del_lnk--> Tibetans. In 1963, he promulgated a democratic constitution which is based upon the <a href="../../wp/u/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights.htm" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, creating an elected <!--del_lnk--> parliament and an <!--del_lnk--> administration to champion his cause. In 1970, he opened the <!--del_lnk--> Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in Dharamshala which houses over 80,000 manuscripts and important knowledge resources related to Tibetan history, politics and culture. It is considered one of the most important institutions for <!--del_lnk--> Tibetology in the world.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="International_advocacy">International advocacy</span></h3>
       <p>At the <!--del_lnk--> Congressional Human Rights Caucus in 1987 in <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, the Dalai Lama gave a speech outlining his ideas for the future status of Tibet. The plan called for Tibet to become a democratic "zone of peace" without <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a>, and with support for <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a>, that barred the entry of <!--del_lnk--> Han Chinese. The plan would come to be known as the "Strasbourg proposal", because the Dalai Lama expanded on the plan at <!--del_lnk--> Strasbourg on 15 June 1988. There, he proposed the creation of a self-governing Tibet "in association with the People's Republic of China." This would have been pursued by negotiations with the PRC government, but the plan was rejected by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile in 1991. The Dalai Lama has indicated that he wishes to return to Tibet only if the People's Republic of China agrees not to make any precondition for his return. In the 1970s, the then-<!--del_lnk--> Paramount leader <!--del_lnk--> Deng Xiaoping set China's sole return requirement to the Dalai Lama as that he "must [come back] as a Chinese citizen.... that is, patriotism".</p>
       <p>The Dalai Lama celebrated his seventieth birthday on 6 July 2005. About 10,000 Tibetan refugees, monks and foreign tourists gathered outside his home. <!--del_lnk--> Patriarch Alexius II of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Orthodox Church affirmed positive relations with Buddhists. Then President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), <!--del_lnk--> Chen Shui-bian, attended an evening celebrating the Dalai Lama's birthday at the <!--del_lnk--> Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei. In October 2008 in Japan, the Dalai Lama addressed the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 Tibetan violence that had erupted and that the Chinese government accused him of fomenting. He responded that he had "lost faith" in efforts to negotiate with the Chinese government, and that it was "up to the Tibetan people" to decide what to do.</p>

       <p>On 6 January 2009, at <!--del_lnk--> Gujarat's <!--del_lnk--> Mahuva, the Dalai Lama inaugurated an <!--del_lnk--> interfaith "World Religions-Dialogue and Symphony" conference convened by Hindu preacher <!--del_lnk--> Morari Bapu. This conference explored "ways and means to deal with the discord among major religions", according to <!--del_lnk--> Morari Bapu.

       <p>The Dalai Lama has shown a nuanced and relatively flexible position on <!--del_lnk--> abortion. He explained that, from the perspective of the Buddhist precepts, abortion is an act of killing.

       <p>The Dalai Lama says that he is active in spreading India's message of non-violence and religious harmony throughout the world. "I am the messenger of India's ancient thoughts the world over." He has said that democracy has deep roots in India. He says he considers India the master and Tibet its disciple, as great scholars like <!--del_lnk--> Nagarjuna went from <!--del_lnk--> Nalanda to Tibet to preach Buddhism in the eighth century. He has noted that millions of people lost their lives in violence and the economies of many countries were ruined due to conflicts in the 20th century. "Let the 21st century be a century of tolerance and dialogue."</p>
       <p>In 1993, the Dalai Lama attended the <!--del_lnk--> World Conference on Human Rights and made a speech titled "Human Rights and Universal Responsibility".</p>
       <p>In 2001, he answered the question of a girl in a <a href="../../wp/s/Seattle.htm" title="Seattle">Seattle</a> school by saying that it is permissible to shoot someone with a gun in self-defense if that person was "trying to kill you," and he emphasized that the shot should not be fatal.</p>

       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">&ldquo;People think of animals as if they were vegetables, and that is not right. We have to change the way people think about animals. I encourage the Tibetan people and all people to move toward a vegetarian diet that doesn&rsquo;t cause suffering.&rdquo;</div>

       </blockquote>
       <p>The Dalai Lama advocates compassion for animals and frequently urges people to try <!--del_lnk--> vegetarianism or at least reduce their consumption of meat. In Tibet, where historically meat was the most common food, most monks historically have been <!--del_lnk--> omnivores, including the Dalai Lamas. The Fourteenth Dalai Lama was raised in a meat-eating family but converted to vegetarianism after arriving in India, where vegetables are much more easily available. He spent many years as a <!--del_lnk--> vegetarian, but after contracting <!--del_lnk--> Hepatitis in India and suffering from weakness, his doctors ordered him to eat meat on alternating days, which he did for several years. He tried switching back to a vegetarian diet, but once again returned to limited consumption of meat. This attracted public attention when, during a visit to the White House, he was offered a vegetarian menu but declined by replying, as he is known to do on occasion when dining in the company of non-vegetarians, "I'm a Tibetan monk, not a vegetarian". His own home kitchen, however, is completely vegetarian.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economics">Economics</span></h3>
       <p>The Dalai Lama has referred to himself as a <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> and has articulated <!--del_lnk--> criticisms of capitalism. He reports hearing of <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a> when he was very young, but only in the context of the destruction of <!--del_lnk--> Communist Mongolia. It was only when he went on his trip to <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> that he studied <!--del_lnk--> Marxist theory. At that time, he reports, "I was so attracted to Marxism, I even expressed my wish to become a <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party member", citing his favorite concepts of <!--del_lnk--> self-sufficiency and equal <!--del_lnk--> distribution of wealth. He does not believe that China implemented "true Marxist policy", and thinks the historical <!--del_lnk--> communist states such as the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> "were far more concerned with their narrow national interests than with the <!--del_lnk--> Workers' International". Of capitalism, he said that <!--del_lnk--> in China, "millions of people's living standards improved", but that it "is only how to make profits", whereas Marxism has "moral ethics".</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">

        <div class="Bug6200">"I think the major flaw of the Marxist regimes is that they have placed too much emphasis on the need to destroy the ruling class, on class struggle, and this causes them to encourage hatred and to neglect compassion. Although their initial aim might have been to serve the cause of the majority, when they try to implement it all their energy is deflected into destructive activities. Once the revolution is over and the ruling class is destroyed, there is nor much left to offer the people; at this point the entire country is impoverished and unfortunately it is almost as if the initial aim were to become poor. I think that this is due to the lack of human solidarity and compassion. The principal disadvantage of such a regime is the insistence placed on hatred to the detriment of compassion."</div>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environment">Environment</span></h3>
       <p>The Dalai Lama is outspoken in his concerns about environmental problems, frequently giving public talks on themes related to the environment. He has pointed out that many rivers in Asia <!--del_lnk--> originate in Tibet, and that the <a href="../../wp/r/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850.htm" title="Retreat of glaciers since 1850">melting of Himalayan glaciers</a> could affect the countries in which the rivers flow. He acknowledged official Chinese laws against <!--del_lnk--> deforestation in Tibet, but is cynical because of possible <!--del_lnk--> official corruption. He was quoted as saying "ecology should be part of our daily life"; personally, he takes showers instead of baths, and turns lights off when he leaves a room. Around 2005, he has started campaigning for <!--del_lnk--> wildlife conservation, including by issuing a religious ruling against wearing tiger and leopard skins as garments. The Dalai Lama supports the <!--del_lnk--> anti-whaling position in the <!--del_lnk--> whaling controversy, but has criticized the activities of groups such as the <!--del_lnk--> Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (which carries out acts of what it calls aggressive non-violence against property). Before the <a href="../../wp/2/2009_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference.htm" title="2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference">2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference</a>, he urged national leaders to put aside domestic concerns and take collective action against <a href="../../wp/c/Climate_change.htm" title="Climate change">climate change</a>.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dorje_Shugden">Dorje Shugden</span></h3>
       <p>During a teaching tour of the UK in May 2008, members of the <!--del_lnk--> Western Shugden Society came out to demonstrate against the banning of a prayer to <!--del_lnk--> Dorje Shugden, which they call religious persecution. Similar protests occurred in Sydney when the Dalai Lama arrived in Australia in June 2008. The Dalai Lama says he had not banned the practice, but strongly discourages it as he feels it promotes a spirit as being more important than Buddha, and that it may encourage cult-like practices and sectarianism within Tibetan Buddhism. The Shugden worshipers in India protest that they are denied admission to hospitals, stores, and other social services provided by the local Tibetan community. The Chinese government demands monks to worship Shugden, in conjunction with forcing them to denounce the Dalai Lama and fly the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese national flag.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recognition_of_the_17th_Karmapa">Recognition of the 17th Karmapa</span></h3>
       <p>Another controversy associated with the Dalai Lama is the recognition of the seventeenth <!--del_lnk--> Karmapa. Two factions of the <!--del_lnk--> Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism have chosen two different Karmapas, leading to a deep division within the Kagyu school. The Dalai Lama has given his support to <!--del_lnk--> Urgyen Trinley Dorje, while supporters of <!--del_lnk--> Trinley Thaye Dorje claim that the Dalai Lama has no authority in the matter, nor is there a historical precedent for a Dalai Lama involving himself in an internal Kagyu dispute. In his 2001 address at the International Karma Kagyu Conference, <!--del_lnk--> Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche&mdash;one of the four Karma Kagyu regents&mdash;accused the Dalai Lama of adopting a "divide and conquer" policy to eliminate any potential political rivalry arising from within the Kagyu school. For his side, the Dalai Lama accepted the prediction letter presented by <!--del_lnk--> Tai Situ Rinpoche (another Karma Kagyu regent) as authentic, and therefore Tai Situ Rinpoche's recognition of Urgyen Trinley Dorje, also as correct. Tibet observer Julian Gearing suggests that there might be political motives to the Dalai Lama's decision: "<i>The Dalai Lama gave his blessing to the recognition of [Urgyen] Trinley, eager to win over the formerly troublesome sect [the Kagyu school], and with the hope that the new Karmapa could play a role in a political solution of the 'Tibet Question.' ...If the allegations are to be believed, a simple nomad boy was turned into a political and religious pawn</i>." However, according to Tsurphu Labrang, articles by Julian Gearing on this subject are biased, unverified and without crosschecking of basic facts.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="CIA_backing">CIA backing</span></h3>
       <p>In October 1998, the Dalai Lama's administration acknowledged that it received $1.7&nbsp;million a year in the 1960s from the U.S. government through the <!--del_lnk--> Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). When asked by CIA officer John Kenneth Knaus in 1995 whether the organisation did a good or bad thing in providing its support, the Dalai Lama replied that though it helped the morale of those resisting the Chinese, "thousands of lives were lost in the resistance" and further, that "the U.S. Government had involved itself in his country's affairs not to help Tibet but only as a Cold War tactic to challenge the Chinese."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ties_to_India">Ties to India</span></h3>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Chinese press has criticized the Dalai Lama for his close ties with India. His 2010 remarks at the <!--del_lnk--> International Buddhist Conference in <!--del_lnk--> Gujarat saying that he was "Tibetan in appearance, but an Indian in spirituality" and referral to himself as a "son of India" in particular led the <i><!--del_lnk--> People's Daily</i> to opine, "Since the Dalai Lama deems himself an Indian rather than Chinese, then why is he entitled to represent the voice of the Tibetan people?" Dhundup Gyalpo of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Tibet Sun</i> shot back that Tibetan religion could be traced back to <!--del_lnk--> Nalanda in India, and that Tibetans have no connection to Chinese "apart... from a handful of culinary dishes". The People's Daily stressed the links between <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Buddhism and <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism and accused the Dalai Lama of "betraying <!--del_lnk--> southern Tibet to India". Two years earlier in 2008, the Dalai Lama said for the first time that the territory, which India claims as part of <!--del_lnk--> Arunachal Pradesh, is part of India, citing the disputed <!--del_lnk--> 1914 Simla Accord.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The Dalai Lama's appeal is variously ascribed to his charismatic personality, international fascination with Buddhism, his <!--del_lnk--> universalist values, international sympathy for the Tibetans, and western <!--del_lnk--> sinophobia. In the 1990s, many films were released by the <!--del_lnk--> American film industry about Tibet, including <!--del_lnk--> biopics of the Dalai Lama. This is attributed to both the Dalai Lama's 1989 Nobel Peace Prize as well as to the euphoria following the <!--del_lnk--> Fall of Communism. The most notable films, <i><!--del_lnk--> Kundun</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Seven Years in Tibet</i> (both released in 1997), portrayed "an idyllic pre-1950 Tibet, with a smiling, soft-spoken Dalai Lama at the helm &ndash; a Dalai Lama sworn to <!--del_lnk--> non-violence": portrayals the Chinese government decried as <!--del_lnk--> ahistorical. One South African official publicly criticised the Dalai Lama's politics and lamented a taboo on criticism of him, saying "To say anything against the Dalai Lama is, in some quarters, equivalent to trying to shoot <!--del_lnk--> Bambi".</p>
       <p>Critics of the news and entertainment media coverage of the controversy charge that <!--del_lnk--> feudal Tibet was not as benevolent as popularly portrayed. The <!--del_lnk--> penal code before 1913 included forms of judicial <!--del_lnk--> mutilation and <!--del_lnk--> capital punishment to enforce a social system controversially described as both <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a> and <!--del_lnk--> serfdom. In response, the Dalai Lama agreed many of old Tibet's practices needed reform. His predecessor had banned extreme punishments and the death penalty. And he had started some reforms like removal of debt inheritance during the early years of his government under the People's Republic of China in 1951.</p>

       <p>In May 2007, <!--del_lnk--> Chhime Rigzing, a senior spokesman for his office, stated that the Dalai Lama was moving into "retirement", but in 2008 the Dalai Lama himself ruled out such a move, saying "There is no... question of retirement." Rigzing stated "The political leadership will be transferred over a period of time but he will inevitably continue to be the spiritual leader". The Dalai Lama announced he would like the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Parliament in Exile to have more responsibility over the <!--del_lnk--> Central Tibetan Administration.</p>
       <p>In response to the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 Tibetan unrest, on 18 March 2008 the Dalai Lama threatened to step down, which would be a first for a Dalai Lama. Aides later clarified that this threat was predicated on a further escalation of violence, and that he did not presently have the intention of leaving his political or spiritual offices.</p>
       <p>In the ensuing months, he held meetings aimed at discussing the future institution of the Dalai Lama, including "[A] conclave, like in the Catholic Church, a woman as my successor, no Dalai Lama anymore, or perhaps even two", referring to the possibility of having both his approved successor and China's approved successor both claiming the title. He has clarified that his goal is to relinquish all temporal power and to no longer play a "pronounced spiritual role" and have a simpler monastic life.</p>
       <p>In a speech given on 10 March 2011, the 14th Dalai Lama stated that he will propose changes to the constitution of the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan government in exile which will remove the Dalai Lama's role as head of state, replacing him with an elected leader.

If it is decided that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should continue and there is a need for the Fifteenth Dalai Lama to be recognized, responsibility for doing so will primarily rest on the concerned officers of the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s Gaden Phodrang Trust. They should consult the various heads of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. They should seek advice and direction from these concerned beings and carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition. I shall leave clear written instructions about this. Bear in mind that, apart from the reincarnation recognized through such legitimate methods, no recognition or acceptance should be given to a candidate chosen for political ends by anyone, including those in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>On 3 October 2011, the Dalai Lama repeated his statement in an interview with Canadian <!--del_lnk--> CTV News. He added that Chinese laws banning the selection of successors based on reincarnation will not impact his decisions. "Naturally my next life is entirely up to me. No one else. And also this is not a political matter," he said in the interview. The Dalai Lama also added that he was not decided on whether he would reincarnate or if he would be the last Dalai Lama.</p>
