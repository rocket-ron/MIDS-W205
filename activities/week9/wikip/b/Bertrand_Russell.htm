       <p><b>Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell</b>, <!--del_lnk--> OM, <!--del_lnk--> FRS (18 May 1872&nbsp;&ndash; 2 February 1970) was a British <!--del_lnk--> philosopher, <!--del_lnk--> logician, <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematician.htm" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a>, <!--del_lnk--> historian, and <!--del_lnk--> social critic. At various points in his life he considered himself a <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberal</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialist">socialist</a>, and a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Pacifism.htm" title="Pacifist">pacifist</a>, but he also admitted that he had never been any of these in any profound sense. He was born in <!--del_lnk--> Monmouthshire, into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in Britain.</p>
       <p>Russell led the British "revolt against <!--del_lnk--> idealism" in the early 20th century. He is considered one of the founders of <!--del_lnk--> analytic philosophy along with his predecessor <!--del_lnk--> Gottlob Frege and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; <a href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_Wittgenstein.htm" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians. He co-authored, with <!--del_lnk--> A. N. Whitehead, <i><!--del_lnk--> Principia Mathematica</i>, an attempt to ground mathematics on logic. His philosophical essay "<!--del_lnk--> On Denoting" has been considered a "paradigm of philosophy." His work has had a considerable influence on <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Set_theory.htm" title="Set theory">set theory</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Linguistics.htm" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Computer_science.htm" title="Computer science">computer science</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> type theory and <!--del_lnk--> type system), and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, especially <!--del_lnk--> philosophy of language, <!--del_lnk--> epistemology, and <!--del_lnk--> metaphysics.</p>
       <p>Russell was a prominent <!--del_lnk--> anti-war activist; he championed <!--del_lnk--> anti-imperialism and went to prison for his pacifism during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Later, he campaigned against <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, then criticised <!--del_lnk--> Stalinist <!--del_lnk--> totalitarianism, attacked the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>'s involvement in the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, and was an outspoken proponent of <!--del_lnk--> nuclear disarmament. In 1950 Russell was awarded the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature.htm" title="Nobel Prize in Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>, "in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions <!--del_lnk--> humanitarian ideals and <!--del_lnk--> freedom of thought."</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Bertrand Russell was born on 18 May 1872 at Ravenscroft, <!--del_lnk--> Trellech, <!--del_lnk--> Monmouthshire, <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, into an influential and liberal family of the <!--del_lnk--> British aristocracy. His parents, <!--del_lnk--> Viscount and <!--del_lnk--> Viscountess Amberley, were radical for their times. Lord Amberley was an <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheist">atheist</a> and consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the biologist <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Spalding. Both were early advocates of <a href="../../wp/b/Birth_control.htm" title="Birth control">birth control</a> at a time when this was considered scandalous. Amberley's atheism was evident when he asked the philosopher <a href="../../wp/j/John_Stuart_Mill.htm" title="John Stuart Mill">John Stuart Mill</a> to act as Russell's secular godfather. Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings had a great effect on Russell's life.</p>
       <p>His paternal grandfather, the <!--del_lnk--> Earl Russell, had twice been asked by <a href="../../wp/q/Queen_Victoria.htm" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> to form a government, serving her as <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> in the 1840s and 1860s. The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the peerage with the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Tudor dynasty. They established themselves as one of Britain's leading <!--del_lnk--> Whig families, and participated in every great political event from the <!--del_lnk--> Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536&ndash;40 to the <a href="../../wp/g/Glorious_Revolution.htm" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> in 1688&ndash;89 and the <!--del_lnk--> Great Reform Act in 1832.</p>
       <p>Lady Amberley was the daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Lord and <!--del_lnk--> Lady Stanley of Alderley. Russell often feared the ridicule of his maternal grandmother, one of the campaigners for <!--del_lnk--> education of women.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Childhood_and_adolescence">Childhood and adolescence</span></h3>
       <p>Russell had two siblings: <!--del_lnk--> Frank (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of <!--del_lnk--> diphtheria, followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of <!--del_lnk--> bronchitis following a long period of <!--del_lnk--> depression. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly <!--del_lnk--> Victorian paternal grandparents, who lived at <!--del_lnk--> Pembroke Lodge in <!--del_lnk--> Richmond Park. His grandfather, former <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <!--del_lnk--> John Russell, died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the <!--del_lnk--> Countess Russell (n&eacute;e Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.</p>
       <p>The countess was from a Scottish <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian family, and successfully petitioned the <!--del_lnk--> Court of Chancery to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Agnosticism.htm" title="Agnostics">agnostics</a>. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting <!--del_lnk--> Darwinism and supporting <!--del_lnk--> Irish Home Rule), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on <!--del_lnk--> social justice and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life&mdash;her favourite Bible verse, 'Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil' (<!--del_lnk--> Exodus 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression, and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.</p>
       <p>Russell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated <a href="../../wp/s/Suicide.htm" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics, and that only the wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide. He was educated at home by a series of tutors.At age 11, his brother Frank introduced him to the work of <a href="../../wp/e/Euclid.htm" title="Euclid">Euclid</a>, which transformed Russell's life.</p>
       <p>During these formative years he also discovered the works of <!--del_lnk--> Percy Bysshe Shelley. In his autobiography, he writes: "I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy." Russell claimed that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of Christian religious dogma, which he found very unconvincing. At this age, he came to the conclusion that there is no <!--del_lnk--> free will and, two years later, that there is no life after death. Finally, at the age of 18, after reading <a href="../../wp/j/John_Stuart_Mill.htm" title="John Stuart Mill">Mill</a>'s "Autobiography", he abandoned the "<!--del_lnk--> First Cause" argument and became an <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheist">atheist</a>.</p>

       <p>Russell won a scholarship to read for the <!--del_lnk--> Mathematical Tripos at <a href="../../wp/t/Trinity_College%252C_Cambridge.htm" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, and commenced his studies there in 1890. He became acquainted with the younger <!--del_lnk--> George Edward Moore and came under the influence of <!--del_lnk--> Alfred North Whitehead, who recommended him to the <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge Apostles. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as a high <!--del_lnk--> Wrangler in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.</p>
       <p>Russell first met the American <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Quakers.htm" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quaker</a> <!--del_lnk--> Alys Pearsall Smith when he was 17 years old. He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family&mdash;they knew him primarily as 'Lord John's grandson' and enjoyed showing him off&mdash;and travelled with them to the continent; it was in their company that Russell visited the <!--del_lnk--> Paris Exhibition of 1889 and was able to climb the <!--del_lnk--> Eiffel Tower soon after it was completed.</p>
       <p>He soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, who was a graduate of <!--del_lnk--> Bryn Mawr College near <a href="../../wp/p/Philadelphia.htm" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her. She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he didn't. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage and they finally divorced in 1921, after a lengthy period of separation. During this period, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including <!--del_lnk--> Lady Ottoline Morrell and the actress <!--del_lnk--> Lady Constance Malleson.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Russell began his published work in 1896 with <i>German Social Democracy</i>, a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the <!--del_lnk--> London School of Economics, where he also lectured on the science of power in the autumn of 1937. He was a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the <!--del_lnk--> Fabian campaigners <!--del_lnk--> Sidney and <!--del_lnk--> Beatrice Webb.</p>
       <p>He now started an intensive study of the <!--del_lnk--> foundations of mathematics at Trinity, during which he discovered <!--del_lnk--> Russell's paradox, which challenged the foundations of <a href="../../wp/s/Set_theory.htm" title="Set theory">set theory</a>. In 1903 he published his first important book on mathematical logic, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Principles of Mathematics</i>, arguing that mathematics could be deduced from a very small number of principles, a work which contributed significantly to the cause of <!--del_lnk--> logicism.</p>
       <p>At the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a "sort of mystic illumination", after witnessing <!--del_lnk--> Whitehead's wife acute suffering in an angina attack. "I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable", Russell would later recall. "At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person."</p>
       <p>In 1905 he wrote the essay "<!--del_lnk--> On Denoting", which was published in the philosophical journal <i><!--del_lnk--> Mind</i>. Russell became a fellow of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society in 1908. The first of three volumes of <i><!--del_lnk--> Principia Mathematica</i>, written with Whitehead, was published in 1910, which, along with the earlier <i>The Principles of Mathematics</i>, soon made Russell world famous in his field.</p>
       <p>In 1910 he became a lecturer in the <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, where he was approached by the Austrian engineering student <a href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_Wittgenstein.htm" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, who became his <!--del_lnk--> PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various <!--del_lnk--> phobias and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's <i><!--del_lnk--> Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> in 1922. Russell delivered his lectures on <!--del_lnk--> Logical Atomism, his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="First World War">First World War</a>. Wittgenstein was, at that time, serving in the Austrian Army and would subsequently spend nine more months in an Italian <!--del_lnk--> prisoner of war camp at the end of the conflict.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_World_War">First World War</span></h3>
       <p>During the First World War, Russell was one of the very few people to engage in active <!--del_lnk--> pacifist activities, and in 1916, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the <!--del_lnk--> Defence of the Realm Act.</p>
       <p>He was charged a fine of &pound;100, which he refused to pay, hoping that he would be sent to prison. However, his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the King James Bible that was stamped "Confiscated by Cambridge Police."</p>
       <p>A later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the US to enter the war on Britain's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in <!--del_lnk--> Brixton prison (see <i><!--del_lnk--> Bertrand Russell's views on society</i>) in 1918. While in prison, Russell read enormously, and wrote the book "<!--del_lnk--> Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy". He was reinstated in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer 1926, and became a Fellow again 1944&ndash;1949.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Between_the_wars_and_second_marriage">Between the wars and second marriage</span></h3>
       <p>In August 1920 Russell travelled to Russia as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution</a>. He met <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin rather disappointing, sensing an "impish cruelty" in him and comparing him to "an opinionated professor". He cruised down the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/v/Volga_River.htm" title="Volga">Volga</a> on a steamship. Russell's lover <!--del_lnk--> Dora Black, a British author, feminist and socialist campaigner, visited Russia independently at the same time&mdash;she was enthusiastic about the revolution, but Russell's experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for it. He wrote a book <i>The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism</i> about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from Britain, all of whom came home thinking well of the regime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.</p>
       <p>Russell subsequently lectured in <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> on philosophy for one year, accompanied by Dora. He went there with optimism and hope, as <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> was then on a new path. Other scholars present in China at the time included <a href="../../wp/r/Rabindranath_Tagore.htm" title="Rabindranath Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, the Nobel laureate <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> poet. While in China, Russell became gravely ill with <a href="../../wp/p/Pneumonia.htm" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> incorrect reports of his death were published in the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> press. When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora notified the world that "Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists." The press, not appreciating the sarcasm, were not amused.</p>
       <p>Dora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to England on 26 August 1921. Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised, on 27 September 1921. Their children were <!--del_lnk--> John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell, born on 16 November 1921, and <!--del_lnk--> Katharine Jane Russell (now Lady Katharine Tait), born on 29 December 1923. Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a>, and education to the layman. Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with <!--del_lnk--> Vivienne Haigh-Wood, the English governess and writer, and first wife of <a href="../../wp/t/T._S._Eliot.htm" title="T. S. Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>.</p>
       <p>Together with Dora, he founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near <!--del_lnk--> Harting, <!--del_lnk--> West Sussex. On 8 July 1930 Dora gave birth to her third child, a daughter, Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.</p>
       <p>Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell. He once said that his title was primarily useful for securing hotel rooms.</p>
       <p>Russell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry. They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Oxford.htm" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> undergraduate named <!--del_lnk--> Patricia ("Peter") Spence, who had been his children's governess since 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, <!--del_lnk--> Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell, 5th Earl Russell, who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the <a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democratic</a> party.</p>
       <p>During the 1930s, Russell became a close friend and collaborator of <!--del_lnk--> V. K. Krishna Menon, then secretary of the India League, the foremost lobby for Indian independence in Great Britain.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Second_World_War">Second World War</span></h3>
       <p>Russell opposed rearmament against <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, but in 1940 changed his view that avoiding a full scale <!--del_lnk--> world war was more important than defeating <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare, "Relative Political Pacifism": war was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils.</p>
       <p>Before the Second World War, Russell taught at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Chicago, later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the <!--del_lnk--> UCLA Department of Philosophy. He was appointed professor at the <!--del_lnk--> City College of New York in 1940, but after a public outcry, the appointment was annulled by a court judgement: his opinions (especially those relating to <!--del_lnk--> sexual morality, detailed in <i><!--del_lnk--> Marriage and Morals</i> ten years earlier) made him "morally unfit" to teach at the college. The protest was started by the mother of a student who would not have been eligible for his graduate-level course in mathematical logic. Many intellectuals, led by <!--del_lnk--> John Dewey, protested against his treatment. <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s often-quoted aphorism that "Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds ... " originated in his open letter in support of Russell, during this time. Dewey and <!--del_lnk--> Horace M. Kallen edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Bertrand Russell Case</i>. He soon joined the <!--del_lnk--> Barnes Foundation, lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of <i><!--del_lnk--> A History of Western Philosophy</i>. His relationship with the eccentric <!--del_lnk--> Albert C. Barnes soon soured, and he returned to Britain in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Later_life">Later life</span></h3>
       <p>During the 1940s and 1950s, Russell participated in many broadcasts over the BBC, particularly <!--del_lnk--> The Brains Trust and the <!--del_lnk--> Third Programme, on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was world famous outside of academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in <!--del_lnk--> Trondheim, Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) in an <!--del_lnk--> aeroplane crash in Hommelvik in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane. <i><!--del_lnk--> A History of Western Philosophy</i> (1945) became a best-seller, and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.</p>
       <p>In a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the USSR's aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an atomic bomb than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides. At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Europe.htm" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a> which it was absorbing into its <!--del_lnk--> sphere of influence. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a <!--del_lnk--> first strike in a war with the USSR, including <!--del_lnk--> Nigel Lawson, who was present when Russell spoke. Others, including Griffin, who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.</p>
       <p>In 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural <!--del_lnk--> Reith Lectures&mdash;what was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC. His series of six broadcasts, titled <i>Authority and the Individual</i>, explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society. Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to <i>Words and Things</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Gellner, which was highly critical of the later thought of <a href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_Wittgenstein.htm" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> and of <!--del_lnk--> Ordinary language philosophy. <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal <i><!--del_lnk--> Mind</i>, which caused Russell to respond via <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times</i>. The result was a month-long correspondence in <i>The Times</i> between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.</p>
       <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> King's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Order of Merit, and the following year he was awarded the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature.htm" title="Nobel Prize in Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>. When he was given the Order of Merit, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/George_VI.htm" title="King George VI">King George VI</a> was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying that "You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted." Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply "That's right, just like your <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Edward_VIII.htm" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">brother</a>" immediately came to mind.</p>
       <p>In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother).</p>
       <p>Russell married his fourth wife, <!--del_lnk--> Edith Finch, soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend <!--del_lnk--> Lucy Donnelly. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son, John, suffered from serious <!--del_lnk--> mental illness, which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and John's mother, Russell's former wife, Dora. John's wife Susan was also mentally ill, and eventually Russell and Edith became the legal guardians of their three daughters(two of whom were later found to have <a href="../../wp/s/Schizophrenia.htm" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>).</p>
       <p>In 1962 Russell played a public role in the <!--del_lnk--> Cuban Missile Crisis: in an exchange of telegrams with Soviet leader <a href="../../wp/n/Nikita_Khrushchev.htm" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless. Russell also wrote to <a href="../../wp/j/John_F._Kennedy.htm" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, who returned his telegram unopened.</p>
       <p>According to historian Peter Knight, after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy.htm" title="John F. Kennedy assassination">John F. Kennedy assassination</a>, Russell, "prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer <!--del_lnk--> Mark Lane in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a <i>Who Killed Kennedy Committee</i> in June 1964, members of which included Michael Foot MP, the wife of Tony Benn MP, the publisher <!--del_lnk--> Victor Gollancz, the writers <!--del_lnk--> John Arden and <!--del_lnk--> J. B. Priestley, and the Oxford history professor <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Trevor-Roper. Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the <!--del_lnk--> Warren Commission Report was published, setting forth <i>16 Questions on the Assassination</i> and equating the Oswald case with the <!--del_lnk--> Dreyfus affair of late 19th century France, in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticized the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.</p>

       <p>Russell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in various political causes, primarily related to nuclear disarmament and opposing the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> (see also <!--del_lnk--> Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal). The 1955 <!--del_lnk--> Russell&ndash;Einstein Manifesto was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by 11 of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time. He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period. He was in contact with <!--del_lnk--> Lionel Rogosin while the latter was filming his anti-war film <i><!--del_lnk--> Good Times, Wonderful Times</i> in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the <!--del_lnk--> New Left. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal about his disapproval of what he felt to be the US government's near-genocidal policies in South Vietnam. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the <!--del_lnk--> Jerusalem Prize, an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society. In October 1965 he tore up his <a href="../../wp/l/Labour_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> card because he suspected the party was going to send soldiers to support the US in the Vietnam War.</p>

       <p>Russell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Russell made a cameo appearance playing himself in the anti-war Hindi film "Aman" which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.</p>
       <p>On 23 November 1969 he wrote to <i>The Times</i> newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in <a href="../../wp/c/Czechoslovakia.htm" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> was "highly alarming". The same month, he appealed to Secretary General <!--del_lnk--> U Thant of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in <!--del_lnk--> South Vietnam during the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. The following month, he protested to <!--del_lnk--> Alexei Kosygin over the expulsion of <!--del_lnk--> Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn from the Writers Union.</p>
       <p>On 31 January 1970 Russell issued a statement which condemned <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s aggression in the Middle East, and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the <!--del_lnk--> War of Attrition, and called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.</p>
       <p>Russell died of <a href="../../wp/i/Influenza.htm" title="Influenza">influenza</a> on 2 February 1970 at his home, <!--del_lnk--> Plas Penrhyn, in <!--del_lnk--> Penrhyndeudraeth, <!--del_lnk--> Merionethshire, Wales.

In accordance with his will, there was no religious ceremony; his ashes were scattered over the Welsh mountains later that year.</p>
       <p>In 1980 a memorial to Russell was commissioned by a committee including the philosopher <!--del_lnk--> A. J. Ayer. It consists of a bust of Russell in <!--del_lnk--> Red Lion Square in London sculpted by Marcelle Quinton.</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Views">Views</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Views_on_philosophy">Views on philosophy</span></h3>
       <p>Russell is generally credited with being one of the founders of <!--del_lnk--> analytic philosophy. He was deeply impressed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> (1646&ndash;1716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except aesthetics. He was particularly prolific in the field of <!--del_lnk--> metaphysics, the <!--del_lnk--> logic and the philosophy of mathematics, the <!--del_lnk--> philosophy of language, <!--del_lnk--> ethics and <!--del_lnk--> epistemology. When <!--del_lnk--> Brand Blanshard asked Russell why he didn't write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he didn't know anything about it, "but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects."</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Views_on_religion">Views on religion</span></h4>
       <p>Russell described himself both as an <a href="../../wp/a/Agnosticism.htm" title="Agnosticism">agnostic</a> and an <a href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheism">atheist</a>. For most of his adult life Russell maintained that religion is little more than superstition and, despite any positive effects that religion might have, it is largely harmful to people. He believed religion and the religious outlook (he considered communism and other systematic ideologies to be forms of religion) serve to impede knowledge, foster fear and dependency, and are responsible for much of the war, oppression, and misery that have beset the world. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the <!--del_lnk--> British Humanist Association and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Views_on_society">Views on society</span></h4>
       <p>Political and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes. He was noted for saying "No one can sit at the bedside of a dying child and still believe in God."</p>
       <p>Russell determined man to be "the product of causes ... his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms, that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, that the whole temple of man's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins&mdash;all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand ...
