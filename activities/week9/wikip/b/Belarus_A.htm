<h2>Our Work in Belarus</h2>
<img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_YKImage_preview" alt="Belarus map" />
<div>
<p>Belarus was severely affected by the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. It 
was for this reason that SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages decided to build a 
village, which provided a home as well as a treatment centre for children suffering from the effects
 of radiation.</p>
<p>At
present SOS Children run various programmes which support children, young
people and families in the surrounding communities. Youth programmes provide
young adults with advice, allowing them to learn how to live
semi-independently. The SOS social centres have been running family strengthening
programmes.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Borovjlany</h3>
<p>In 1991 the state government gave us a plot of land in <strong><a title="Child Sponsorship background from Borovljany, Belarus" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/c/Child_Sponsorship_Background_From_Borovljany_Belarus.htm">Borovljany</a>,</strong>
 about 15 miles north-east of the capital Minsk. The Village has 13 family houses which are home to 100 children. An SOS Youth Home has
 been established in Minsk for the older children who have grown up in 
the Village and are on the verge of independence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We run a <a title="Family Strengthening" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/f/Family_Strengthening.htm">Family Strengthening Programme</a>
 which works with vulnerable families and communities who are unable to 
properly care for their children due to health or socio-economic 
problems. We provide holistic support to enable children to 
stay within their natural families, whilst ensuring their educational 
and developmental needs are met.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, there is a health centre for children here affected by 
radiation. Every year, over 200 children from the area around Chernobyl 
receive treatment for radiation damage at the SOS Social Centre, with 
priority given to children from very poor or single-parent families. &nbsp;As well as medical treatment, the centre offers remedial education and a
 wide range of chances for children to be children.</p>
<p>In Spring 
2008, we started an &#x2018;SOS Playbus&#x2019; Mobile centre for children 
offering imaginative play material. The bus stops off at public parks 
and hospitals, at orphanages and grey concrete tower blocks. The educational games teach the children about their 
rights, the environment and other themes. During the events the 
Playbus-team also works with parents and teachers.</p>
<h3>Marina Gorka</h3>
<p>
A second SOS Children's Village was opened in 2004 in<strong> <a title="Child Sponsorship background from Marina Gorka, Belarus" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/c/Child_Sponsorship_Background_From_Marina_Gorka_Belarus.htm">Marina Gorka</a></strong>,
 about 25 miles from Minsk and it consists of 12 family houses for 84 
children. The Village is currently being expanded to include a few extra
 houses. There is also an SOS Social Centre that runs a <a title="Family Strengthening" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/f/Family_Strengthening.htm">Family Strengthening Programme</a> for 700 vulnerable children and their families in the local 
community. The neighbouring residential area is well-equipped and offers
 a park, a school, a nursery, a hospital and shops.</p>

<h3><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_XVImage_preview" alt="SOS child in Belarus" />Life in SOS Children's Village Belarus <br /></h3>
<p><strong>Dima arrived at SOS Children&#x2019;s Village Borovljany recently from a local orphanage. He describes the differences between the Village and the orphanage:</strong></p>
<p><strong>"<em>Everything here feels so free - I can play outside the house if I want. In the orphanage there was only work all the time; although here children also help sometimes, it's completely different. Here at home, in the Children&#x2019;s Village, we are seven kids and a mother. In the orphanage&#x2026;I wouldn't say it was bad to live there, but many children escaped because they wanted a real home. There were always many children and a lot of noise - no chance to be alone. Everybody in the orphanage wanted to have a home. Here in my new home I have a family.</em>&#x201D;</strong></p>
