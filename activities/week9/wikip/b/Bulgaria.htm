Its location has made it a historical crossroad for various civilisations and as such it is the home of some of the earliest metalworking, religious and other cultural artifacts in the world.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Prehistoric cultures began developing on Bulgarian lands during the <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic period. Its ancient history saw the presence of the <!--del_lnk--> Thracians, and later the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>. The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD, which dominated most of the <!--del_lnk--> Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Slavs.htm" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic peoples</a> during the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. With the downfall of the <!--del_lnk--> Second Bulgarian Empire in 1396, its territories came under <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> rule for nearly five centuries. The <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Turkish War of 1877&ndash;1878 created the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both World Wars. In 1946 it became a <!--del_lnk--> Socialist state with a single-party system. In <!--del_lnk--> 1989 the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party allowed <!--del_lnk--> multi-party elections, following which Bulgaria transitioned to <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and a market-based economy.</p>
       <p>The population of 7.36 million people is predominantly urban and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its <!--del_lnk--> 28 provinces. Most commercial and cultural activities are concentrated in the capital <!--del_lnk--> Sofia. The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry, power engineering and agriculture, all relying on local natural resources.</p>
       <p>The current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a <!--del_lnk--> unitary parliamentary republic with a high degree of political, administrative and economic centralisation. It is a member of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Europe; a founding state of the <!--del_lnk--> Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_Security_Council.htm" title="United Nations Security Council">UN Security Council</a> three times.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Kozarnika cave in northwestern Bulgaria holds the earliest known examples of <!--del_lnk--> symbolic behaviour in humans, dating to 1,400,000 BC. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic <!--del_lnk--> Hamangia culture, <!--del_lnk--> Vin&#x10D;a culture and the <!--del_lnk--> eneolithic <!--del_lnk--> Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The <!--del_lnk--> Varna Necropolis offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.</p>
       <p>One of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians were the <!--del_lnk--> Thracians, who populated various tribes until king <!--del_lnk--> Teres united most of them in the <!--del_lnk--> Odrysian kingdom around 500 BC. They were eventually subjugated by <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> and later by the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> in 46 AD.

A peace treaty with Byzantium in 681 and the establishment of a permanent capital at <!--del_lnk--> Pliska south of the Danube marked the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> First Bulgarian Empire. The Bulgars gradually mixed up with the local population, adopting a common language on the basis of <!--del_lnk--> Slavonic.</p>
       <p>Succeeding khans strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Tervel established Bulgaria as a major military power by defeating a 26,000-strong <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arab_people.htm" title="Arab">Arab</a> army during the <!--del_lnk--> Second Arab Siege of Constantinople. <!--del_lnk--> Krum doubled the country's territory, killed Byzantine emperor <!--del_lnk--> Nicephorus I in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Pliska, and introduced the first written code of law.

       <p>Wars with <!--del_lnk--> Croatians, <!--del_lnk--> Magyars, <!--del_lnk--> Pechenegs and <!--del_lnk--> Serbs and the spread of the <!--del_lnk--> Bogomil heresy weakened Bulgaria after Simeon's death.

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>After his conquest of Bulgaria, <!--del_lnk--> Basil II prevented revolts and discontent by retaining the rule of the local nobility and recognising the <!--del_lnk--> autocephaly of the <!--del_lnk--> Archbishopric of Ohrid. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, <!--del_lnk--> the largest being led by <!--del_lnk--> Peter Delyan. In 1185 <!--del_lnk--> Asen dynasty nobles <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Asen I and <!--del_lnk--> Peter IV organised a <!--del_lnk--> major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with <!--del_lnk--> Tarnovo as a capital.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Kaloyan, the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominion to <a href="../../wp/b/Belgrade.htm" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Ohrid. He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="The Pope">the Pope</a> and received a royal crown from a <!--del_lnk--> papal legate. The empire reached its zenith under <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Asen II (1218&ndash;1241), when commerce and culture flourished. The strong economic and religious influence of Tarnovo made it a "<!--del_lnk--> Third Rome", unlike the already declining Constantinople.</p>
       <p>The country's military and economic might declined after the Asen dynasty ended in 1257, facing internal conflicts, constant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks and <!--del_lnk--> Mongol domination. By the end of the 14th century, factional divisions between <!--del_lnk--> the feudal landlords and the spread of Bogomilism had caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to split into three tsardoms&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Vidin, <!--del_lnk--> Tarnovo and <!--del_lnk--> Karvuna&mdash;and several semi-independent principalities that fought each other, along with Byzantines, Hungarians, Serbs, <!--del_lnk--> Venetians and <!--del_lnk--> Genoese. By the late 14th century the <!--del_lnk--> Ottoman Turks had started their conquest of Bulgaria and had taken most towns and fortresses south of the Balkan mountains.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ottoman_rule">Ottoman rule</span></h3>
       <p>Tarnovo was captured by the Ottomans after a three-month siege in 1393. After the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom, the Ottomans conquered all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube. The nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was <!--del_lnk--> enserfed to Ottoman masters, with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries. Under the Ottoman system, Bulgarians were considered an <!--del_lnk--> inferior class of people. They were subjected to heavy taxes and partial <!--del_lnk--> Islamisation, and their culture was suppressed. Ottoman authorities established the Rum <!--del_lnk--> Millet, a religious administrative community which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying as Christians. However, the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive, and that helped it to survive as in some rural, remote areas, as well as in the militant <!--del_lnk--> Catholic community in the northwestern part of the country.</p>

       <p>Several Bulgarian revolts erupted throughout the nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule, most notably the <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg-backed Tarnovo uprisings <!--del_lnk--> in 1598 and <!--del_lnk--> in 1686, the <!--del_lnk--> Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and <!--del_lnk--> Karposh's Rebellion in 1689. In the 18th century, the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> in Western Europe provided influence for the initiation of a movement known as the <!--del_lnk--> National awakening of Bulgaria. It restored national consciousness and became a key factor in the liberation struggle, resulting in the 1876 <!--del_lnk--> April Uprising. Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion. The massacres prompted the <!--del_lnk--> Great Powers to take action. They convened the <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople Conference in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans. This allowed the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Empire.htm" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> to seek a solution by force without risking military confrontation with other Great Powers, as had happened in the <a href="../../wp/c/Crimean_War.htm" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a>.

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire, and included a provision to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire. It never went into effect, as the <!--del_lnk--> Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, provided for a much smaller state comprising <!--del_lnk--> Moesia and the region of <!--del_lnk--> Sofia, leaving large populations of Bulgarians outside the new country. This played a significant role in forming Bulgaria's militaristic approach to foreign affairs during the first half of the 20th century.</p>
       <p>The Bulgarian principality won <!--del_lnk--> a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarised and was often referred to as "the Balkan <!--del_lnk--> Prussia". Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became involved in three consecutive conflicts&mdash;two <!--del_lnk--> Balkan Wars and <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. After a disastrous defeat in the <!--del_lnk--> Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the <!--del_lnk--> Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at <!--del_lnk--> Doiran and <!--del_lnk--> Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 412,000 casualties. More than 253,000 refugees emigrated to Bulgaria from 1912-1929 due to the effects of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.</p>
       <p>The political unrest resulting from these losses led to the establishment of a royal <!--del_lnk--> authoritarian dictatorship by tsar <!--del_lnk--> Boris III (1918&ndash;1943). Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of <!--del_lnk--> the Axis but declined to participate in <!--del_lnk--> Operation Barbarossa and saved its Jewish population from deportation to <!--del_lnk--> concentration camps. The sudden death of Boris III in the summer of 1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany and the Communist guerilla movement gained momentum. Following the advance of the Soviet Army in the region, on 5 September 1944 Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria and subsequently invaded it. Within days in September 1944 the Communist-dominated <!--del_lnk--> Fatherland Front took power, ending the alliance with Germany and joining the Allied side until the war ended.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> left-wing uprising of 9 September 1944 led to the abolition of monarchic rule, but it was not until 1946 that a <!--del_lnk--> single-party <!--del_lnk--> people's republic was established. It became a part of the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of <!--del_lnk--> Georgi Dimitrov (1946&ndash;1949), who laid the foundations for a rapidly industrialising <!--del_lnk--> stalinist state. By the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly, while political repressions were lessened. The Soviet-style <a href="../../wp/p/Planned_economy.htm" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a> saw some market-oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under <!--del_lnk--> Todor Zhivkov (1954&ndash;1989). His daughter <!--del_lnk--> Lyudmila bolstered national pride by promoting Bulgarian heritage, culture and arts worldwide. In an attempt to erase the identity of the <!--del_lnk--> ethnic Turk minority, an assimilation campaign was launched in 1984. This resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 of them to Turkey.</p>
       <p>Under the influence of the <!--del_lnk--> collapsing Eastern Bloc, on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the <!--del_lnk--> Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the freshly renamed Communist Party). A <!--del_lnk--> new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected President and for a Prime Minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth&mdash;the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under Communism well into the early 2000s. A 1997 reform package restored economic growth, but living standards continued to suffer. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status. It became a member of <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> in 2004 and of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> in 2007.</p>

       <p>Bulgaria is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary democracy">parliamentary democracy</a> in which the most powerful executive position is that of prime minister. The political system has three branches&mdash;legislative, executive and judicial, with <!--del_lnk--> universal suffrage for <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Citizenship.htm" title="Citizen">citizens</a> at least 18 years old. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections.</p>
       <p>Political parties gather in the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly, which consists of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements. The <!--del_lnk--> president serves as the <!--del_lnk--> head of state and <!--del_lnk--> commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the <!--del_lnk--> presidential veto by a simple majority vote of all members of parliament. <!--del_lnk--> Boyko Borisov of the centre-right party <!--del_lnk--> Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) became prime minister on 27 July 2009, while GERB-backed <!--del_lnk--> Rosen Plevneliev was elected president in 2011, after receiving 52.5 per cent of the votes on the second round against 47.5 per cent for his Socialist Party opponent <!--del_lnk--> Ivaylo Kalfin. Until February 2013 GERB had 117 seats in the National Assembly and no permanent political allies, ruling as a <!--del_lnk--> minority government.</p>
       <p>The government resigned on 20 February 2013 after <!--del_lnk--> nationwide protests caused by high costs of utilities, low living standards and the failure of the democratic system. The protest wave was marked by self-immolations, spontaneous demonstrations and a strong sentiment against political parties. As a consequence, the Parliament was dissolved and a new provisional government was set up by the President. The May 2013 elections were narrowly won by GERB, which has no support from any of the other three parties present in Parliament.</p>

       <p>Bulgaria has a typical <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_law_%2528legal_system%2529.htm" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a> legal system. The judiciary is overseen by the Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Administrative Court and Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. Bulgaria's judiciary, along with other institutions, remains one of Europe's most corrupt and inefficient.</p>
       <p>Law enforcement is carried out by organisations mainly subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The <!--del_lnk--> National Police Service (NPS) combats general crime, maintains public order and supports the operations of other law enforcement agencies. NPS fields 27,000 police officers in its local and national sections. The Ministry of Interior also heads the Border Police Service and the <!--del_lnk--> National Gendarmerie&mdash;a specialised branch for anti-terrorist activity, crisis management and riot control. Counterintelligence and national security are the responsibility of the State Agency for National Security, established in 2008.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Administrative_divisions">Administrative divisions</span></h3>
       <p>Bulgaria is a <!--del_lnk--> unitary state. Since the 1880s, the number of territorial management units has varied from seven to 26. Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (<i>oblasti</i>, singular <i><!--del_lnk--> oblast</i>). A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralisation of the economic system. It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces subdivide into 264 <!--del_lnk--> municipalities.</p>
       <p>Municipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly <!--del_lnk--> centralised state, where the national Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.</p>

       <p>Bulgaria became a member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_Security_Council.htm" title="United Nations Security Council">Security Council</a> three times, most recently from 2002 to 2003. Bulgaria was also among the founding nations of the <!--del_lnk--> Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. It joined <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> on 29 March 2004, signed the European Union <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. Euro-Atlantic integration became a priority for the country since the fall of Communism, although the Communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the <!--del_lnk--> European Communities by 1987. Bulgaria's relationship with its neighbours since 1990 has generally been good. The country also plays an important role in promoting regional security. Bulgaria has an active tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece, maintains strong relations with EU members, the United States and Russia, and continues to improve its traditionally good ties with <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> HIV trial in Libya, which followed after the imprisonment of several Bulgarian nurses in <a href="../../wp/b/Benghazi.htm" title="Benghazi">Benghazi</a> in 1998, had a significant impact on relations between Bulgaria, the European Union, and Libya. It resulted in the release of the nurses by Muammar Gaddafi's government, which was granted a contract to receive a nuclear reactor and weapons supplies from France in exchange.</p>

       <p>Bulgaria hosted six <!--del_lnk--> KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft and 200 support personnel for the war effort in Afghanistan in 2001, which was the first stationing of foreign forces on its territory since World War II. International military relations were further expanded in April 2006, when Bulgaria and the United States signed a defence cooperation agreement providing for the usage of <!--del_lnk--> Bezmer and <!--del_lnk--> Graf Ignatievo air bases, the <!--del_lnk--> Novo Selo training range, and a logistics centre in <!--del_lnk--> Aytos as <!--del_lnk--> joint military training facilities. The same year <i><!--del_lnk--> Foreign Policy</i> magazine listed Bezmer Air Base as one of the six most important overseas facilities used by the <!--del_lnk--> USAF due to its proximity to the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>. A total of 756 troops are <!--del_lnk--> deployed abroad as part of various UN and NATO missions. Historically, Bulgaria deployed significant numbers of military and civilian advisors in Soviet-allied countries, such as <!--del_lnk--> Nicaragua and <!--del_lnk--> Libya (more than 9,000 personnel).</p>
       <p>Domestic defence is the responsibility of the all-<!--del_lnk--> volunteer <!--del_lnk--> military of Bulgaria, consisting of <!--del_lnk--> land forces, <!--del_lnk--> navy and <!--del_lnk--> air force. The land forces comprise of two mechanised brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems in six air bases, and the navy operates a variety of ships, helicopters and coastal defence measures. Following a series of reductions beginning in 1990, the number of active troops contracted from 152,000 in 1988 to about 32,000 in the 2000s, supplemented by a reserve force of 302,500 soldiers and officers and 34,000 paramilitary servicemen. The inventory is mostly of Soviet origin, such as <!--del_lnk--> MiG-29 fighters, <!--del_lnk--> SA-10 Grumble SAMs and <!--del_lnk--> SS-21 Scarab short-range <!--del_lnk--> ballistic missiles. By 2020 the government will spend $1.4 billion for the deployment of new fighter jets, communications systems and <!--del_lnk--> cyber warfare capabilities. Total military spending in 2009 cost $819&nbsp;million.</p>

       <p>Bulgaria has an emerging <!--del_lnk--> market economy in the upper middle income range, where the private sector accounts for more than 80 per cent of GDP. From a largely agricultural country with a predominantly rural population in 1948, by the 1980s Bulgaria had transformed into an industrial economy with scientific and technological research at the top of its budgetary expenditure priorities. The loss of <!--del_lnk--> COMECON markets in 1990 and the subsequent "<!--del_lnk--> shock therapy" of the planned system caused a steep decline in industrial and agricultural production, ultimately followed by an economic collapse in 1997. The economy largely recovered during a period of rapid growth several years later, but individual mean income remains one of the lowest in the EU at 768 leva (393 euro) per month. More than a fifth of the labour force are employed on a <a href="../../wp/m/Minimum_wage.htm" title="Minimum wage">minimum wage</a> of 1 euro per hour. Wages, however, account for only half of the total household income, owing to the substantial <!--del_lnk--> informal economy which amounts to almost 32% of GDP. Bulgarian PPS <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gross_domestic_product.htm" title="GDP">GDP</a> <!--del_lnk--> per capita stood at 45 per cent of the EU average in 2011 according to <!--del_lnk--> Eurostat data, while the cost of living was 49 per cent of the average. The currency is the <!--del_lnk--> lev, which is pegged to the euro at a rate of 1.95583 lev&#x430; for one euro. Bulgaria is not part of the <!--del_lnk--> eurozone and has abandoned its plans to adopt the euro.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Economic indicators have worsened amid the <!--del_lnk--> late-2000s financial crisis. After several consecutive years of high growth, GDP contracted with 5.5 per cent in 2009 and unemployment remains above 12 per cent. Industrial output declined with 10 per cent, mining with 31 per cent, and ferrous and metal production marked a 60 per cent drop. Positive growth was restored in 2010, although investments and consumption continue to decline steadily due to rising unemployment. The same year, intercompany debt exceeded 51 billion euro, meaning that 60 per cent of all Bulgarian companies were mutually indebted. By 2012, it had increased to 83 billion euro, or 227 per cent of GDP. The government implemented strict austerity measures with IMF and EU encouragement to some positive fiscal results, but the social consequences of these measures have been "catastrophic" according to the <!--del_lnk--> International Trade Union Confederation. <!--del_lnk--> Corruption remains another obstacle to economic growth. Bulgaria is one of the most corrupt European Union members and ranks 75th in the <!--del_lnk--> Corruption Perceptions Index.</p>

       <p>Economic activities are fostered by the lowest personal and corporate income tax rates in the EU, and the second-lowest <!--del_lnk--> public debt of all member states at 16.5 per cent of GDP in 2012. In 2012, GDP (<!--del_lnk--> PPP) was estimated at $104&nbsp;billion, with a per capita value of $14,235. Sofia and the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Yugozapaden planning area are the most developed region of the country with a per capita PPS GDP of $23,162 in 2009. Bulgaria is a net receiver of funds from the EU. The absolute amount of received funds was 589 million euro in 2009.</p>
       <p>The labour force is 2.45&nbsp;million people, of whom 7.1 per cent are employed in agriculture, 35.2 per cent are employed in industry and 57.7 per cent are employed in the services sector. Extraction of metals and minerals, production of <!--del_lnk--> chemicals, <!--del_lnk--> machinery and vehicle components, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Oil_refinery.htm" title="Refined petroleum fuel">petroleum refinement</a> and steel are among the major industrial activities. Mining and its related industries employ a total of 120,000 people and generate about five per cent of the country's GDP. Bulgaria is Europe's sixth-largest coal producer. Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors. Almost all top export items of Bulgaria are industrial commodities such as oil products, copper products and pharmaceuticals. Bulgaria is also a net exporter of agricultural and food products, of which two-thirds go to <!--del_lnk--> OECD countries. It is the largest global producer of perfumery essential oils such as <!--del_lnk--> lavender and <!--del_lnk--> rose oil. Agriculture has declined significantly in the past two decades. Production in 2008 amounted to only 66 per cent of that between 1999 and 2001, while cereal and vegetable yields have dropped by nearly 40 per cent since 1990. Of the services sector, tourism is the most significant contributor to economic growth. In recent years, Bulgaria has emerged as a travelling destination with its inexpensive resorts and beaches outside the reach of the tourist industry. <!--del_lnk--> Lonely Planet ranked it among its top 10 destinations for 2011. Most of the visitors are British, Romanian, German and Russian. The capital <!--del_lnk--> Sofia, the medieval capital <!--del_lnk--> Veliko Tarnovo, coastal resorts <!--del_lnk--> Golden Sands and <!--del_lnk--> Sunny Beach and winter resorts <!--del_lnk--> Bansko, <!--del_lnk--> Pamporovo and <!--del_lnk--> Borovets are some of the locations most visited by tourists.</p>

       <p>Bulgaria spends 0.25 per cent of GDP on scientific research, thus having one of the lowest R&amp;D budgets in Europe. Chronic underinvestment in research since 1990 forced many scientific professionals to leave the country. As a result, Bulgaria scores low in terms of innovation, competitiveness and high-value added exports. Principal areas of research and development are energy, <!--del_lnk--> nanotechnology, <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a> and medicine. The <!--del_lnk--> Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) is the leading scientific establishment and employs most Bulgarian researchers in its numerous institutes. It has been active in the field of <!--del_lnk--> space science with <!--del_lnk--> RADOM-7 radiation monitoring experiments on the <a href="../../wp/i/International_Space_Station.htm" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Chandrayaan-1, and domestically developed space <!--del_lnk--> greenhouses on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mir.htm" title="Mir space station">Mir space station</a>.

       <p>In the 1980s Bulgaria was known as the "<!--del_lnk--> Silicon Valley of the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Bloc" because of its large-scale computing technology exports to <!--del_lnk--> COMECON states. The <!--del_lnk--> ICT sector generates 10 per cent of GDP and employs the third-largest contingent of ICT specialists in the world. A <!--del_lnk--> National Centre for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) operates the only supercomputer in Southeastern Europe.</p>
       <p>Internet usage has increased rapidly since 2000&mdash;the number of users grew from 430,000 to 3.4&nbsp;million (48 per cent penetration rate) in 2010. Average Broadband Internet speed is the second-highest in the world after that of South Korea. Telephone services are widely available, and a central digital trunk line connects most regions.

       <p>Bulgaria's strategic geographic location and well-developed energy sector make it a key European energy centre despite its lack of significant fossil fuel deposits. Nearly 34 per cent of its electricity is produced by the <!--del_lnk--> nuclear power station at Kozloduy and public opinion strongly supports nuclear energy development. The rapid expansion of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power stations make Bulgaria one of the fastest-growing wind energy producers in the world. The country aims to produce 16 per cent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020.</p>
       <p>The national road network has a total length of 40,231 kilometres (24,998&nbsp;mi), of which 39,587 kilometres (24,598&nbsp;mi) are paved, but nearly half fall into the lowest international rating for paved roads. Railroads are a major mode of freight transportation, although highways carry a progressively larger share of freight. Bulgaria has 6,238 kilometres (3,876&nbsp;mi) of railway track and currently a total of 81&nbsp;km of <!--del_lnk--> high-speed lines are in operation. Rail links are available with Romania, Greece and Serbia, and express trains serve direct routes to <a href="../../wp/k/Kiev.htm" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Minsk.htm" title="Minsk">Minsk</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. Sofia and Plovdiv are the country's air travel hubs, while Varna and Burgas are the principal maritime trade ports. Varna is also scheduled to be the first station on EU territory to receive natural gas through the <!--del_lnk--> South Stream pipeline.</p>

       <p>The population of Bulgaria is 7,364,570 people according to the 2011 national census. The majority of the population, or 72.5 per cent, reside in urban areas; approximately one-sixth of the total population is concentrated in Sofia. <!--del_lnk--> Bulgarians are the main ethnic group and comprise 84.8 per cent of the population. <!--del_lnk--> Turkish and <!--del_lnk--> Roma minorities comprise 8.8 and 4.9 per cent, respectively; some 40 smaller minorities comprise 0.7 per cent, and 0.8 per cent do not self-identify with an ethnic group. All ethnic groups speak <!--del_lnk--> Bulgarian, the only language with official status and native for 85.2 per cent of the population. The oldest written <!--del_lnk--> Slavic language, Bulgarian is distinguishable from the other languages in this group through certain grammatical peculiarities such as the lack of <!--del_lnk--> noun cases and <!--del_lnk--> infinitives, and a suffixed <!--del_lnk--> definite article.</p>
       <p>Bulgaria is in a state of demographic crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people&nbsp;&ndash; mostly young adults&nbsp;&ndash; left the country by 2005. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 per cent of families do not have children under the age of 16. Consequently, population growth and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. Bulgaria ranks 113th globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 73.6 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly <!--del_lnk--> cardiovascular diseases, <!--del_lnk--> neoplasms and <!--del_lnk--> respiratory diseases.</p>
       <p>Bulgaria has <!--del_lnk--> a universal healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing portion of the costs of <!--del_lnk--> primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 per cent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries.</p>

       <p>Government estimates from 2003 put the literacy rate at 98.6 per cent, with no significant difference between the sexes. Educational standards have been <!--del_lnk--> traditionally high, although still far from European benchmarks and in continuing deterioration for the past decade. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had deteriorated. State expenditures for education are far below the European Union average. The <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of Education, Youth and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. The State provides free education in primary and secondary public schools. The educational process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level. High schools can be technical, vocational, general or specialised in a certain discipline, while higher education consists of a 4-year <!--del_lnk--> bachelor degree and a 1-year Master's degree.</p>
       <p>The Constitution of Bulgaria defines it as a <!--del_lnk--> secular state with guaranteed religious freedom, but designates <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Orthodoxy</a> as a "traditional" religion. The <!--del_lnk--> Bulgarian Orthodox Church gained <!--del_lnk--> autocephalous status in 927 AD, and currently has 12 dioceses and over 2,000 priests. More than three-quarters of Bulgarians subscribe to Eastern Orthodoxy. <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Muslims are the second-largest community and constitute 10 per cent of the religious makeup, although a majority of them do not pray and find the use of <!--del_lnk--> Islamic veils unacceptable. Less than three per cent are affiliated with other religions, 11.8 per cent do not self-identify with a religion and 21.8 per cent refused to state their beliefs.</p>

       <p>Traditional Bulgarian culture contains mainly <!--del_lnk--> Thracian, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Slavs.htm" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Bulgar heritage, along with <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/History_of_Iran.htm" title="Ancient Persia">Persian</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Celtic influences. <!--del_lnk--> Nine historical and natural objects have been inscribed in the list of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="UNESCO World Heritage Site">UNESCO World Heritage Sites</a>: the <!--del_lnk--> Madara Rider, the Thracian tombs in <!--del_lnk--> Sveshtari and <!--del_lnk--> Kazanlak, the <!--del_lnk--> Boyana Church, the <!--del_lnk--> Rila Monastery, the <!--del_lnk--> Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo, <!--del_lnk--> Pirin National Park, <!--del_lnk--> Sreburna Nature Reserve and the ancient city of <!--del_lnk--> Nesebar. <!--del_lnk--> Nestinarstvo, a ritual fire-dance of Thracian origin, is included in the list of <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. Fire is an essential element of Bulgarian folklore, used to banish evil spirits and diseases. Bulgarian folklore personifies illnesses as witches and has a wide range of creatures, including <!--del_lnk--> lamya, <!--del_lnk--> samodiva (<!--del_lnk--> veela) and <!--del_lnk--> karakondzhul. Some of the customs and rituals against these spirits have survived and are still practiced, most notably the <!--del_lnk--> kukeri and survakari. <!--del_lnk--> Martenitsa is also widely celebrated.</p>
       <p>Along with traditional culture, much heritage from other civilisations has been accumulated since Antiquity. Local researchers claim that the number of archaeological sites is the third-largest in Europe after Italy and Greece. The first book written in a <!--del_lnk--> Germanic language&mdash;the 4th century <!--del_lnk--> Wulfila Bible, was created in <!--del_lnk--> Nicopolis ad Istrum in a small <!--del_lnk--> Gothic community in present-day northern Bulgaria. The <!--del_lnk--> first Christian monastery in Europe was established around the same time. <!--del_lnk--> Plovdiv is one of the <!--del_lnk--> oldest continuously inhabited cities, and <!--del_lnk--> the oldest golden treasure in the world, consisting of coins, weapons and jewellery dating to 4,600 BC, was discovered near Varna in 1972. The site revealed evidence of the first European civilisation.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Slavic culture was centered in both the First and Second Bulgarian Empires during much of the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Preslav, <!--del_lnk--> Ohrid and <!--del_lnk--> Tarnovo literary schools exerted considerable cultural influence over the Eastern Orthodox world. Many languages in Eastern Europe and Asia use <!--del_lnk--> Cyrillic script, which originated in the Preslav Literary School around the 9th century. The medieval advancement in the arts and letters ended with the Ottoman conquest when many masterpieces were destroyed, and artistic activities did not re-emerge until the <!--del_lnk--> National Revival in the 19th century. After the Liberation, Bulgarian literature quickly adopted European literary styles such as <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Symbolism. Since the beginning of the 20th century, several Bulgarian authors, such as <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Vazov, <!--del_lnk--> Pencho Slaveykov, <!--del_lnk--> Peyo Yavorov, <!--del_lnk--> Yordan Radichkov and <!--del_lnk--> Tzvetan Todorov have gained prominence. In 1981 Bulgarian-born writer <!--del_lnk--> Elias Canetti was awarded the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature.htm" title="Nobel Prize in Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>.</p>

       <p>Bulgarian folk music is by far the most extensive traditional art and has slowly developed throughout the ages as a fusion of Eastern and Western influences. It contains Far Eastern, Oriental, medieval Eastern Orthodox and standard Western European tonalities and modes. The music has a distinctive sound and uses a wide range of traditional instruments, such as <!--del_lnk--> gadulka, <!--del_lnk--> gaida (<!--del_lnk--> bagpipe), <!--del_lnk--> kaval and <!--del_lnk--> tupan. One of its most distinguishing features is <i>extended rhythmical time</i>, which has no equivalent in the rest of European music. The <!--del_lnk--> State Television Female Vocal Choir is the most famous performing folk ensemble, and received a <!--del_lnk--> Grammy Award in 1990. Bulgaria's written musical composition can be traced back to the early Middle Ages and the works of <!--del_lnk--> Yoan Kukuzel (c. 1280&ndash;1360). Classical music, opera and ballet are represented by composers <!--del_lnk--> Emanuil Manolov, <!--del_lnk--> Pancho Vladigerov and <!--del_lnk--> Georgi Atanasov and singers <!--del_lnk--> Ghena Dimitrova and <!--del_lnk--> Boris Hristov. Bulgarian performers have gained popularity in several other genres like <!--del_lnk--> progressive rock (<!--del_lnk--> FSB), <!--del_lnk--> electropop (<!--del_lnk--> Mira Aroyo) and <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Milcho Leviev).</p>
       <p>The religious visual arts heritage includes <!--del_lnk--> frescoes, <!--del_lnk--> murals and <!--del_lnk--> icons, many produced by the medieval <!--del_lnk--> Tarnovo Artistic School. <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Dimitrov, <!--del_lnk--> Nikolay Diulgheroff and <!--del_lnk--> Christo are some of the most famous modern Bulgarian artists. Film industry remains weak: in 2010, Bulgaria produced three feature films and two documentaries with public funding. Cultural events are advertised in the largest media outlets, including the <!--del_lnk--> Bulgarian National Radio, and daily newspapers <i><!--del_lnk--> Dneven Trud</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> 24 Chasa</i>.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Bulgarian cuisine is similar to those of other Balkan countries and demonstrates a strong Turkish and Greek influence. <!--del_lnk--> Yogurt, <!--del_lnk--> lukanka, <!--del_lnk--> banitsa, <!--del_lnk--> shopska salad, <!--del_lnk--> lyutenitsa and <!--del_lnk--> kozunak are among the best-known local foods. Oriental dishes such as <!--del_lnk--> moussaka, <!--del_lnk--> gyuvech, and <!--del_lnk--> baklava are also present. Meat consumption is lower than the European average, given a notable preference for a large variety of salads. <!--del_lnk--> Rakia is a traditional fruit <!--del_lnk--> brandy which was consumed in Bulgaria as early as the 14th century. <!--del_lnk--> Bulgarian wine is known for its <!--del_lnk--> Traminer, <!--del_lnk--> Muskat and <!--del_lnk--> Mavrud sorts, of which up to 200,000 tonnes are produced annually. Until 1989, Bulgaria was the world's second-largest wine exporter.</p>
       <p>Bulgaria performs well in sports such as <a href="../../wp/w/Wrestling.htm" title="Wrestling">wrestling</a>, <!--del_lnk--> weight-lifting, <!--del_lnk--> boxing, gymnastics and tennis. The country fielded one of the leading men's volleyball teams, ranked eighth in the world according to the 2012 <!--del_lnk--> FIVB rankings. <a href="../../wp/a/Association_football.htm" title="Association football">Football</a> is by far the most popular sport. Some famous players are <!--del_lnk--> Fulham forward <!--del_lnk--> Dimitar Berbatov and <!--del_lnk--> Hristo Stoichkov, winner of the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Boot and the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Ball and the most successful Bulgarian player of all time. Prominent domestic clubs include <!--del_lnk--> PFC CSKA Sofia and <!--del_lnk--> PFC Levski Sofia. The best performance of the national team at FIFA World Cup finals came <!--del_lnk--> in 1994, when it advanced to the semi-finals by defeating consecutively <!--del_lnk--> Greece, <!--del_lnk--> Argentina, <!--del_lnk--> Mexico and <!--del_lnk--> Germany, finishing fourth. Bulgaria has participated in most Olympic competitions since its first appearance at the <a href="../../wp/1/1896_Summer_Olympics.htm" title="1896 Summer Olympics">1896 games</a>, when it was represented by <!--del_lnk--> Charles Champaud. The country has won a total of 218 medals: 52 gold, 86 silver, and 80 bronze, which puts it in 24th place in the <!--del_lnk--> all-time ranking.</p>
