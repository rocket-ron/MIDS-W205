       <p>A <b>battleship</b> is a large <!--del_lnk--> armored <!--del_lnk--> warship with a main <!--del_lnk--> battery consisting of heavy <!--del_lnk--> caliber <!--del_lnk--> guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship afloat, and a fleet of battleships was vital for any nation which desired to maintain <!--del_lnk--> command of the sea. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the battleship was replaced by the <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft_carrier.htm" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carrier</a> as the most powerful kind of warship afloat. Some battleships remained in service during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> and the last were decommissioned in the 1990s.</p>
       <p>The word <i>battleship</i> was coined around 1794 and is a contraction of the phrase <i><!--del_lnk--> line-of-battle ship,</i> the dominant wooden warship during the <!--del_lnk--> Age of Sail. The term came into formal use in the late 1880s to describe a type of <!--del_lnk--> ironclad warship, now referred to by historians as <!--del_lnk--> pre-dreadnought battleships. In 1906, the commissioning of <!--del_lnk--> HMS&nbsp;<i>Dreadnought</i> heralded a revolution in battleship design. Following battleship designs, influenced by HMS <i>Dreadnought</i>, were referred to as "<!--del_lnk--> dreadnoughts".</p>
       <p>Battleships were a symbol of <!--del_lnk--> naval dominance and national might, and for decades the battleship was a major factor in both <!--del_lnk--> diplomacy and <a href="../../wp/m/Military_strategy.htm" title="Military strategy">military strategy</a>. The global <!--del_lnk--> arms race in battleship construction began in Europe, following the 1890 publication of <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Thayer Mahan's <i><!--del_lnk--> The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660&ndash;1783</i>. This arms race culminated at the decisive <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Tsushima in 1905; the outcome of which significantly influenced the design of HMS <i>Dreadnought</i>. The launch of <i>Dreadnought</i> in 1906 commenced a new naval arms race which was widely considered to have been an indirect cause of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Naval Treaties of the 1920s and 1930s limited the number of battleships, though technical innovation in battleship design continued. Both the <!--del_lnk--> Allies and the <!--del_lnk--> Axis Powers deployed battleships during World War II.</p>
       <p>The value of the battleship has been questioned, even during the period of their prominence. In spite of the immense resources spent on battleships, there were few pitched battleship clashes. Even with their enormous firepower and protection, battleships were increasingly vulnerable to much smaller, cheaper ordnance and craft: initially the <!--del_lnk--> torpedo and the <!--del_lnk--> naval mine, and later aircraft and the <!--del_lnk--> guided missile. The growing range of naval engagements led to the <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft_carrier.htm" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carrier</a> replacing the battleship as the leading <!--del_lnk--> capital ship during World War II, with the last battleship to be launched being <!--del_lnk--> HMS&nbsp;<i>Vanguard</i> in 1944. Battleships were retained by the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy into the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> for <!--del_lnk--> fire support purposes. The last U.S. battleships, <!--del_lnk--> USS&nbsp;<i>Wisconsin</i> and <!--del_lnk--> USS&nbsp;<i>Missouri</i>, were decommissioned in 1991 and 1992, and finally stricken from the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Naval Vessel Register in 2006 and 1995, respectively.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ships_of_the_line">Ships of the line</span></h2>
       <p>A ship of the line was a large, unarmored <a href="../../wp/w/Wood.htm" title="Wood">wooden</a> sailing ship on which was mounted a <!--del_lnk--> battery of up to 120 <!--del_lnk--> smoothbore <!--del_lnk--> guns and <!--del_lnk--> carronades. The ship of the line was a gradual evolution of a basic design that dates back to the 15th century, and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of <!--del_lnk--> line of battle tactics in the early 17th century and the end of the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The sheer number of guns fired <!--del_lnk--> broadside meant that a sailing battleship could wreck any wooden vessel, smashing its <!--del_lnk--> hull and <!--del_lnk--> masts and killing its crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.</p>
       <p>The first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Steam_engine.htm" title="Steam power">steam power</a> as an auxiliary <!--del_lnk--> propulsion system. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy in the first half of the 19th century, initially for small craft and later for <!--del_lnk--> frigates. The <!--del_lnk--> French Navy introduced steam to the line of battle with the 90-gun <!--del_lnk--> <i>Le Napol&eacute;on</i> in 1850&mdash;the first true steam battleship. <i>Napoleon</i> was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots (22&nbsp;km/h), regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement. The introduction of steam accelerated the growth in size of battleships. France and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland.htm" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom</a> were the only countries to develop <!--del_lnk--> fleets of wooden steam screw battleships, although several other navies operated small numbers of screw battleships, including <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Empire.htm" title="Russian Empire">Russia</a> (9), <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Turkey</a> (3), <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> (2), <!--del_lnk--> Naples (1), <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> (1) and <!--del_lnk--> Austria (1).</p>

       </div>
       <p>The adoption of steam power was only one of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the <!--del_lnk--> ironclad: powered by steam, protected by metal armor, and armed with guns firing high-explosive <!--del_lnk--> shells.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Explosive_shells">Explosive shells</span></h3>
       <p>Guns which fired explosive or incendiary shells were a major threat to wooden ships, and these weapons quickly became widespread after the introduction of 8&nbsp;inch shell guns as part of the standard armament of French and American line-of-battle ships in 1841. In the <a href="../../wp/c/Crimean_War.htm" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a>, six line-of-battle ships and two frigates of the Russian <!--del_lnk--> Black Sea Fleet destroyed seven Turkish frigates and three corvettes with explosive shells at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Sinop in 1853. Later in the war, French ironclad floating batteries used similar weapons against the defenses at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Kinburn.</p>
       <p>Nevertheless wooden-hulled ships stood up comparatively well to shells, as shown in the 1866 <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Lissa, where the modern Austrian steam two-decker <i>Kaiser</i> ranged across a confused battlefield, rammed an <!--del_lnk--> Italian ironclad and took 80 hits from Italian ironclads, many of which were shells, but including at least one 300&nbsp;pound shot at point blank range. Despite losing her <!--del_lnk--> bowsprit and her foremast, and being set on fire, she was ready for action again the very next day.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The development of high-explosive shells made the use of iron <!--del_lnk--> armor plate on warships necessary. In 1859 <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> launched <!--del_lnk--> <i>La Gloire</i>, the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had the profile of a ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys, <i>La Gloire</i> was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor. <i>Gloire</i> prompted further innovation from the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.</p>
       <p>The superior armored frigate <!--del_lnk--> <i>Warrior</i> followed <i>La Gloire</i> by only 14 months, and both nations embarked on a program of building new ironclads and converting existing screw ships of the line to armored frigates. Within two years, Italy, Austria, <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_Empire.htm" title="Spanish Empire">Spain</a> and Russia had all ordered ironclad warships, and by the time of the famous clash of the <!--del_lnk--> USS&nbsp;<i>Monitor</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> CSS <i>Virginia</i> at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Hampton Roads at least eight navies possessed ironclad ships.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The term "battleship" was officially adopted by the Royal Navy in the re-classification of 1892. By the 1890s, there was an increasing similarity between battleship designs, and the type that later became known as the 'pre-dreadnought battleship' emerged. These were heavily armored ships, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets, and without sails. The typical first-class battleship of the pre-dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> tons, had a speed of 16 knots (30&nbsp;km/h), and an armament of four 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns in two turrets fore and aft with a mixed-caliber secondary battery amidships around the superstructure. An early design with superficial similarity to the pre-dreadnought is the British <!--del_lnk--> <i>Devastation</i>&nbsp;class of 1871.</p>
       <p>The slow-firing 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) main guns were the principal weapons for battleship-to-battleship combat. The intermediate and secondary batteries had two roles. Against major ships, it was thought a 'hail of fire' from quick-firing secondary weapons could distract enemy gun crews by inflicting damage to the superstructure, and they would be more effective against smaller ships such as <!--del_lnk--> cruisers. Smaller guns (12-pounders and smaller) were reserved for protecting the battleship against the threat of torpedo attack from <a href="../../wp/d/Destroyer.htm" title="Destroyer">destroyers</a> and <!--del_lnk--> torpedo boats.</p>
       <p>The beginning of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with Britain reasserting her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations. However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be more powerful than the two next most powerful fleets combined was established. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.</p>
       <p>In the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th, the escalation in the building of battleships became an <!--del_lnk--> arms race between Britain and <!--del_lnk--> Germany. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power. Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Japan. Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>, the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> all had second-rate fleets led by <!--del_lnk--> armored cruisers, <!--del_lnk--> coastal defence ships or <!--del_lnk--> monitors.</p>
       <p>Pre-dreadnoughts continued the technical innovations of the ironclad. Turrets, armor plate, and <a href="../../wp/s/Steam_engine.htm" title="Steam engine">steam engines</a> were all improved over the years, and <!--del_lnk--> torpedo tubes were introduced. A small number of designs, including the American <!--del_lnk--> <i>Kearsarge</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Virginia</i> classes, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch primary. Results were poor: recoil factors and blast effects resulted in the 8-inch battery being completely unusable, and the inability to train the primary and intermediate armaments on different targets led to significant tactical limitations. Even though such innovative designs saved weight (a key reason for their inception), they proved too cumbersome in practice.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Dreadnought_era">Dreadnought era</span></h2>
       <p>In 1906, the British <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> launched the revolutionary <!--del_lnk--> HMS&nbsp;<i>Dreadnought</i>. Created as a result of pressure from Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Sir John ("Jackie") Fisher, HMS <i>Dreadnought</i> made existing battleships obsolete. Combining an "all-big-gun" armament of ten 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns with unprecedented speed (from steam turbine engines) and protection, she prompted navies worldwide to re-evaluate their battleship building programmes. While the Japanese had laid down an all-big-gun battleship, <i>Satsuma</i> in 1904, and the concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in circulation for several years, it had yet to be validated in combat. <i>Dreadnought</i> sparked a new <!--del_lnk--> arms race, principally between Britain and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the new class of warships became a crucial element of national power.</p>
       <p>Technical development continued rapidly through the dreadnought era, with step changes in armament, armor and propulsion. Ten years after <i>Dreadnought</i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s commissioning, much more powerful ships, the super-dreadnoughts, were being built.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In the first years of the 20th century, several navies worldwide experimented with the idea of a new type of battleship with a uniform armament of very heavy guns.</p>
       <p>Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Vittorio Cuniberti, the Italian Navy's chief naval architect, articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903. When the <i><!--del_lnk--> Regia Marina</i> did not pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in <!--del_lnk--> <i>Jane's</i> proposing an "ideal" future British battleship, a large armored warship of 17,000&nbsp;tons, armed solely with a single calibre main battery (twelve 12-inch {305&nbsp;mm} guns), carrying 300-millimetre (12&nbsp;in) <!--del_lnk--> belt armor, and capable of 24 <!--del_lnk--> knots (44&nbsp;km/h).</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Japanese War provided operational experience to validate the 'all-big-gun' concept. At the <!--del_lnk--> Yellow Sea and <!--del_lnk--> Tsushima, pre-dreadnoughts exchanged volleys at ranges of 7,600&ndash;12,000 yd (7 to 11&nbsp;km), beyond the range of the secondary batteries. It is often held that these engagements demonstrated the importance of the 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) gun over its smaller counterparts, though some historians take the view that secondary batteries were just as important as the larger weapons.</p>
       <p>In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme were the first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was considered too thin, demanding a substantial redesign. The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to be imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional <!--del_lnk--> triple-expansion steam engines.</p>

       </div>
       <p>As early as 1904, Jackie Fisher had been convinced of the need for fast, powerful ships with an all-big-gun armament. If Tsushima influenced his thinking, it was to persuade him of the need to standardise on 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns. Fisher's concerns were <a href="../../wp/s/Submarine.htm" title="Submarine">submarines</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Destroyer.htm" title="Destroyer">destroyers</a> equipped with torpedoes, then threatening to outrange battleship guns, making speed imperative for <!--del_lnk--> capital ships. Fisher's preferred option was his brainchild, the <!--del_lnk--> battlecruiser: lightly armored but heavily armed with eight 12-inch guns and propelled to 25 knots (46&nbsp;km/h) by <!--del_lnk--> steam turbines.</p>
       <p>It was to prove this revolutionary technology that <i>Dreadnought</i> was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, and was the first large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the <!--del_lnk--> wings, giving her at her launch twice the <!--del_lnk--> broadside of anything else afloat. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76&nbsp;mm) <!--del_lnk--> quick-firing guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship afloat in a gun battle, and conceivably win.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p><i>Dreadnought</i> was to have been followed by three <!--del_lnk--> <i>Invincible</i>-class <!--del_lnk--> battlecruisers, their construction delayed to allow lessons from <i>Dreadnought</i> to be used in their design. While Fisher may have intended <i>Dreadnought</i> to be the last Royal Navy battleship, the design was so successful he found little support for his plan to switch to a battlecruiser navy. Although there were some problems with the ship (the wing turrets had limited arcs of fire and strained the hull when firing a full broadside, and the top of the thickest armor belt lay below the waterline at full load), the Royal Navy promptly commissioned another six ships to a similar design in the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bellerophon</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>St. Vincent</i> classes.</p>
       <p>An American design, <!--del_lnk--> <i>South Carolina</i>, authorized in 1905 and laid down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but she and her sister, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Michigan</i>, were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior layout of the main battery, dispensing with <i>Dreadnought'</i>s wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Arms_race">Arms race</span></h3>
       <p>In 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by HMS <i>Dreadnought</i>, the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and 50 over Germany. In 1906, the Royal Navy owned the field with <i>Dreadnought</i>. The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts. Possession of modern battleships was not only vital to naval power, but also, as with nuclear weapons today, represented a nation's standing in the world. Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Austria, and the United States all began dreadnought programmes; and second-rank powers including Turkey, <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="World_War_I">World War I</span></h2>
       <p>The First World War was an anticlimax for the great dreadnought fleets. There was no decisive clash of modern battlefleets to compare with the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Tsushima. The role of battleships was marginal to the great land struggle in France and Russia; and it was equally marginal to the <!--del_lnk--> First Battle of the Atlantic, the battle between <!--del_lnk--> German submarines and British merchant shipping.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>By virtue of geography, the Royal Navy could keep the German <!--del_lnk--> High Seas Fleet bottled up in the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be likely to result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds.</p>
       <p>The first two years of war saw conflict in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by <!--del_lnk--> battlecruisers at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Heligoland Bight and <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Dogger Bank and raids on the English coast. On May 31, 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on German terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Jutland.htm" title="Battle of Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>. The German fleet withdrew to port at its earliest opportunity after two short encounters with the British fleet. This reinforced German determination never to engage in a fleet to fleet battle.</p>
       <p>In the other naval theatres there were no decisive pitched battles. In the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>, engagement between <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Empire.htm" title="Russian Empire">Russian</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Turkish</a> battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic</a>, action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Moon Sound at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The <!--del_lnk--> Adriatic was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Austria-Hungary.htm" title="Austria&ndash;Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a> dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. And in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a>, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on <!--del_lnk--> Gallipoli.</p>
       <p>The war illustrated the vulnerability of battleships to cheaper weapons. In September 1914, the potential threat posed to <!--del_lnk--> capital ships by German U-boats was confirmed by successful attacks on British cruisers, including the sinking of three British <!--del_lnk--> armored cruisers by the German submarine <!--del_lnk--> U-9 in less than an hour. Sea mines proved a threat the next month, when the recently commissioned British super-dreadnought <!--del_lnk--> <i>Audacious</i> struck a mine and sank. By the end of October, the British had changed their strategy and tactics in the North Sea to reduce the risk of U-boat attack. The German plan for the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Jutland.htm" title="Battle of Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> relied on U-boat attacks on the British fleet; and the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower at Jutland was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers closing on British battleships, causing them to turn away to avoid the threat of torpedo attack. Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships and casualties amongst cruisers led to growing concern in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships.</p>
       <p>The German High Seas Fleet, for their part, were determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines; and since the submarines were needed more for raiding commercial traffic, the fleet stayed in port for the remainder of the war. Other theatres equally showed the role of small craft in damaging or destroying dreadnoughts: <!--del_lnk--> SMS <i>Szent Istv&aacute;n</i> of the <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Hungarian Navy was sunk by <!--del_lnk--> Italian <!--del_lnk--> motor torpedo boats in June 1918, while her sister ship, <!--del_lnk--> SMS <i>Viribus Unitis</i> was sunk by <!--del_lnk--> frogmen. The <!--del_lnk--> Allied capital ships lost in Gallipoli were sunk by mines and torpedo, while a Turkish pre-dreadnought, <i>Messudieh</i> was caught in the <!--del_lnk--> Dardanelles by a British submarine.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Inter-war_period">Inter-war period</span></h2>
       <p>For many years, <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Germany</a> simply had no battleships. The <!--del_lnk--> Armistice with Germany required that most of the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in <!--del_lnk--> Scapa Flow, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were <!--del_lnk--> scuttled by their German crews on 21 June 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any <!--del_lnk--> capital ships.</p>

       <p>The inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms race breaking out.</p>
       <p>While the victors were not limited by the Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were crippled after the war. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the <!--del_lnk--> Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan. The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the <!--del_lnk--> First Geneva Naval Conference (1927), the <!--del_lnk--> First London Naval Treaty (1930), the <!--del_lnk--> Second Geneva Naval Conference (1932), and finally the <!--del_lnk--> Second London Naval Treaty (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on 1 September 1939 at the beginning of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply. The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched from 1919&ndash;1939 than from 1905&ndash;1914. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British <!--del_lnk--> N3 class battleship, the first American <!--del_lnk--> <i>South Dakota</i>-class, and the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> <i>Kii</i>&nbsp;class&mdash;all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor&mdash;never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as <!--del_lnk--> treaty battleships.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>As early as 1914, the British Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Percy Scott predicted that battleships would soon be made irrelevant by <!--del_lnk--> aircraft. By the end of World War I, aircraft had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon. In 1921 the Italian general and air theorist <!--del_lnk--> Giulio Douhet completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled <i>The Command of the Air</i>, which foresaw the dominance of air power over naval units.</p>
       <p>In the 1920s, General <!--del_lnk--> Billy Mitchell of the <!--del_lnk--> United States Army Air Corps, believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, testified in front of Congress that "1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for about the price of one battleship" and that a squadron of these bombers could sink a battleship, making for more efficient use of government funds. This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a careful series of bombing tests alongside Navy and <!--del_lnk--> Marine bombers. In 1921, he bombed and sank numerous ships, including the "unsinkable" German World War I battleship <!--del_lnk--> <i>Ostfriesland</i> and the American pre-dreadnought <!--del_lnk--> <i>Alabama</i>.</p>
       <p>Although Mitchell had required "war-time conditions", the ships sunk were obsolete, stationary, defenseless and had no damage control. The sinking of <i>Ostfriesland</i> was accomplished by violating an agreement that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions: Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rules, and sank the ship within minutes in a coordinated attack. The stunt made headlines, and Mitchell declared, "No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them." While far from conclusive, Mitchell's test was significant because it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot. Rear Admiral <!--del_lnk--> William A. Moffett used public relations against Mitchell to make headway toward expansion of the U.S. Navy's nascent aircraft carrier program.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Rearmament">Rearmament</span></h3>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy, and <a href="../../wp/i/Imperial_Japanese_Navy.htm" title="Imperial Japanese Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> extensively upgraded and modernized their World War I&ndash;era battleships during the 1930s. Among the new features were an increased tower height and stability for the optical rangefinder equipment (for gunnery control), more armor (especially around turrets) to protect against plunging fire and aerial bombing, and additional anti-aircraft weapons. Some British ships received a large block superstructure nicknamed the "Queen Anne's castle", such as in the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Warspite</i>, which would be used in the new conning towers of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>King George V</i> <!--del_lnk--> fast battleships. External bulges were added to improve both buoyancy to counteract weight increase and provide underwater protection against mines and torpedoes. The Japanese rebuilt all of their battleships, plus their battlecruisers, with distinctive "<!--del_lnk--> pagoda" structures, though the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hiei</i> received a more modern bridge tower that would influence the new <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yamato</i>-class battleships. Bulges were fitted, including steel tube array to improve both underwater and vertical protection along waterline. The U.S. experimented with <!--del_lnk--> cage masts and later tripod masts, though after <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbour</a> some of the most severely damaged ships such as <!--del_lnk--> <i>West Virginia</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>California</i> were rebuilt to a similar appearance to their <a href="../../wp/i/Iowa-class_battleship.htm" title="Iowa-class battleship"><i>Iowa</i>&nbsp;class</a> contemporaries (called tower masts). Radar, which was effective beyond visual contact and was effective in complete darkness or adverse weather conditions, was introduced to supplement optical fire control.</p>
       <p>Even when war threatened again in the late 1930s, battleship construction did not regain the level of importance which it had held in the years before World War I. The "building holiday" imposed by the naval treaties meant that the building capacity of dockyards worldwide was relatively reduced, and the strategic position had changed.</p>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Germany</a>, the ambitious <!--del_lnk--> Plan Z for naval rearmament was abandoned in favour of a strategy of submarine warfare supplemented by the use of battlecruisers and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bismarck</i>-class battleships as commerce raiders. In Britain, the most pressing need was for air defenses and convoy escorts to safeguard the civilian population from bombing or starvation, and re-armament construction plans consisted of five ships of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>King George V</i> class. It was in the Mediterranean that navies remained most committed to battleship warfare. France intended to build six battleships of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Dunkerque</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Richelieu</i> classes, and the Italians two <!--del_lnk--> <i>Littorio</i>-class ships. Neither navy built significant aircraft carriers. The U.S. preferred to spend limited funds on aircraft carriers until the <!--del_lnk--> <i>South Dakota</i>&nbsp;class. Japan, also prioritising aircraft carriers, nevertheless began work on three mammoth <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yamato</i>-class ships (although the third, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Shinano</i>, was later completed as a carrier) and a planned fourth was cancelled.</p>
       <p>At the outbreak of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Civil War, the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish navy consisted of only two small dreadnought battleships, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Espa&ntilde;a</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Jaime I</i>. <i>Espa&ntilde;a</i> (originally named <i>Alfonso XIII</i>), by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of <!--del_lnk--> El Ferrol, fell into <!--del_lnk--> Nationalist hands in July 1936. The crew aboard <i>Jaime I</i> murdered their officers, mutinied, and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side had one battleship; however, the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers. The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties, and shore bombardment, rarely in direct fighting against other surface units. In April 1937, <i>Espa&ntilde;a</i> ran onto a mine laid by friendly forces, and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, <i>Jaime I</i> was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss. Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On 29 May 1937, two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship <!--del_lnk--> <i>Deutschland</i> outside <!--del_lnk--> Ibiza, causing severe damage and loss of life. <!--del_lnk--> <i>Admiral Scheer</i> retaliated two days later by bombarding <!--del_lnk--> Almer&iacute;a, causing much destruction, and the resulting <!--del_lnk--> <i>Deutschland</i> incident meant the end of German and Italian support for non-intervention.</p>

       <p>The German battleship <!--del_lnk--> <i>Schleswig-Holstein</i>&mdash;an obsolete <!--del_lnk--> pre-dreadnought&mdash;fired the first shots of World War II with the bombardment of the Polish garrison at <!--del_lnk--> Westerplatte; and the final surrender of the Japanese Empire took place aboard a United States Navy battleship, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Missouri</i>. Between those two events, it had become clear that aircraft carriers were the new principal ships of the fleet and that battleships now performed a secondary role.</p>
       <p>Battleships played a part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theatres; in the Atlantic, the Germans used their battleships as independent commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little strategic importance. The <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Atlantic was fought between destroyers and submarines, and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft_carrier.htm" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carriers</a>.</p>
       <p>In the first year of the war, armored warships defied predictions that aircraft would dominate naval warfare. <!--del_lnk--> <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Gneisenau</i> surprised and sank the aircraft carrier <!--del_lnk--> <i>Glorious</i> off western <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> in June 1940. This engagement marked the last time a fleet carrier was sunk by surface gunnery. In the <!--del_lnk--> Attack on Mers-el-K&eacute;bir, British battleships opened fire on the French battleships harboured in Algiers with their own heavy guns, and later pursued fleeing French ships with planes from aircraft carriers.</p>
       <p>The subsequent years of the war saw many demonstrations of the maturity of the aircraft carrier as a strategic naval weapon and its potential against battleships. The British air attack on the Italian naval base at <!--del_lnk--> Taranto sank one Italian battleship and damaged two more. The same <!--del_lnk--> Swordfish torpedo bombers played a crucial role in sinking the German commerce-raider <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bismarck</i>.</p>

       <p>On 7 December 1941 the Japanese launched a surprise <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbour</a>. Within a short time five of eight U.S. battleships were sunk or sinking, with the rest damaged. The American aircraft carriers were out to sea, however, and evaded detection. They in turn would take up the fight, eventually turning the tide of the war in the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> sinking of the British battleship <i>Prince of Wales</i> and her escort, the battlecruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Repulse</i>, demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack while at sea without sufficient air cover, finally settling the argument begun by Mitchell in 1921. Both warships were under way and en route to attack the Japanese amphibious force that had invaded <!--del_lnk--> Malaya when they were caught by Japanese land-based <!--del_lnk--> bombers and <!--del_lnk--> torpedo bombers on 10 December 1941.</p>
       <p>At many of the early crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance <!--del_lnk--> Coral Sea and <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Midway.htm" title="Battle of Midway">Midway</a>, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yamato</i>&nbsp;class, which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46&nbsp;cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never given a chance to show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.</p>
       <p>The last battleship confrontation in history was the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf.htm" title="Battle of Surigao Strait">Battle of Surigao Strait</a>, on October 25, 1944, in which a numerically and technically superior American battleship group destroyed a lesser Japanese battleship group by gunfire after it had already been devastated by destroyer torpedo attacks. All but one of the American battleships in this confrontation had previously been sunk by the Attack on <!--del_lnk--> Pearl Harbour and subsequently raised and repaired. When <!--del_lnk--> <i>Mississippi</i> fired the last salvo of this battle, the last salvo fired by a battleship against another heavy ship, she was "firing a funeral salute to a finished era of naval warfare." In April 1945, during the battle for <!--del_lnk--> Okinawa, the world's most powerful battleship, the <i>Yamato</i>, was sent out against a massive U.S. force on <!--del_lnk--> a suicide mission and sunk by overwhelming carrier aircraft with nearly all hands.</p>

       </div>
       <p>After World War II, several navies retained their existing battleships, but they were no longer strategically dominant military assets. Indeed, it soon became apparent that they were no longer worth the considerable cost of construction and maintenance and only one new battleship was commissioned after the war, <!--del_lnk--> HMS&nbsp;<i>Vanguard</i>. During the war it had been demonstrated that battleship-on-battleship engagements like <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf.htm" title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a> or the sinking of <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hood</i> were the exception and not the rule, and with the growing role of aircraft engagement ranges were becoming longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armor of a battleship was equally irrelevant in the face of a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear attack as tactical missiles with a range of 100 kilometres (60&nbsp;mi) or more could be mounted on the Soviet <!--del_lnk--> <i>Kildin</i>-class <a href="../../wp/d/Destroyer.htm" title="Destroyer">destroyer</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Whiskey-class <a href="../../wp/s/Submarine.htm" title="Submarine">submarine</a>. By the end of the 1950s, minor vessel classes which formerly offered no noteworthy opposition now were capable of eliminating battleships at will.</p>
       <p>The remaining battleships met a variety of ends. <!--del_lnk--> USS&nbsp;<i>Arkansas</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Nagato</i> were sunk during the testing of nuclear weapons in <!--del_lnk--> Operation Crossroads in 1946. Both battleships proved resistant to nuclear air burst but vulnerable to underwater nuclear explosions. The Italian <!--del_lnk--> <i>Giulio Cesare</i> was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed <i>Novorossiysk</i>; she was sunk by a left over German mine in the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> on 29 October 1955. The two <!--del_lnk--> <i>Andrea Doria</i>-class ships were scrapped in 1956. The French <!--del_lnk--> <i>Lorraine</i> was scrapped in 1954, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Richelieu</i> in 1968, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Jean Bart</i> in 1970.</p>
       <p>The United Kingdom's four surviving <!--del_lnk--> <i>King George V</i>-class ships were scrapped in 1957, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Vanguard</i> followed in 1960. All other surviving British battleships had been sold or broken up by 1949. The Soviet Union's <i><!--del_lnk--> <i>Petropavlovsk</i></i> was scrapped in 1953, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sevastopol</i> in 1957 and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya</i> (back under her original name, <i>Gangut</i>, since 1942) in 1956-7. Brazil's <!--del_lnk--> <i>Minas Gerais</i> was scrapped in Genoa in 1953, and her sister ship <!--del_lnk--> <i>S&atilde;o Paulo</i> sank during a storm in the Atlantic <i>en route</i> to the breakers in Italy in 1951.</p>
       <p>Argentina kept its two <!--del_lnk--> <i>Rivadavia</i>-class ships until 1956 and Chile kept <!--del_lnk--> <i>Almirante Latorre</i> (formerly <!--del_lnk--> HMS&nbsp;<i>Canada</i>) until 1959. The <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> battlecruiser <i>Yavuz</i> (formerly <!--del_lnk--> <i>Goeben</i>, launched in 1911) was scrapped in 1976 after an offer to sell her back to Germany was refused. Sweden had several small coastal-defense battleships, one of which, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Gustav V</i>, survived until 1970. The Soviets scrapped four large incomplete cruisers in the late 1950s, whilst plans to build a number of new <!--del_lnk--> <i>Stalingrad</i>-class <!--del_lnk--> battlecruisers were abandoned following the death of <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> in 1953. The three old German battleships <!--del_lnk--> <i>Schleswig-Holstein</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Schlesien</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hessen</i> all met similar ends. <i>Hessen</i> was taken over by the Soviet Union and renamed <i>Tsel</i>. She was scrapped in 1960. <i>Schleswig-Holstein</i> was renamed <i>Borodino</i>, and was used as a target ship until 1960. <i>Schlesien</i>, too, was used as a target ship. She was broken up between 1952 and 1957.</p>

       <p>The <a href="../../wp/i/Iowa-class_battleship.htm" title="Iowa-class battleship"><i>Iowa</i>-class</a> battleships gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships. <a href="../../wp/r/Radar.htm" title="Radar">Radar</a> and computer-controlled gunfire could be aimed with pinpoint accuracy to target. The U.S. recommissioned all four <i>Iowa</i>-class battleships for the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War and the <!--del_lnk--> <i>New Jersey</i> for the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. These were primarily used for shore bombardment, <i>New Jersey</i> firing nearly 6,000 rounds of 16&nbsp;inch shells and over 14,000 rounds of 5&nbsp;inch projectiles during her tour on the gunline, seven times more rounds against shore targets in Vietnam than she had fired in the Second World War.</p>
       <p>As part of <!--del_lnk--> Navy Secretary <!--del_lnk--> John F. Lehman's effort to build a <!--del_lnk--> 600-ship Navy in the 1980s, and in response to the commissioning of <i><!--del_lnk--> Kirov</i> by the Soviet Union, the United States recommissioned all four <i>Iowa</i>-class battleships. On several occasions, battleships were support ships in <!--del_lnk--> carrier battle groups, or led their own <!--del_lnk--> battleship battle group. These were modernized to carry <!--del_lnk--> Tomahawk missiles, with <i>New Jersey</i> seeing action bombarding <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> in 1983 and 1984, while <!--del_lnk--> <i>Missouri</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Wisconsin</i> fired their 16&nbsp;inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles during <!--del_lnk--> Operation Desert Storm in 1991. <i>Wisconsin</i> served as the <!--del_lnk--> TLAM strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of <i>Desert Storm</i>, firing a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. The primary threat to the battleships were Iraqi shore based surface-to-surface missiles; <i>Missouri</i> was targeted by two <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraqi</a> <!--del_lnk--> Silkworm missiles, with one missing and another being intercepted by the British destroyer <!--del_lnk--> HMS&nbsp;<i>Gloucester</i>.</p>
       <p>All four <i>Iowa</i>s were decommissioned in the early 1990s, making them the last battleships to see active service. USS <i>Iowa</i> and USS <i>Wisconsin</i> were, until fiscal year 2006, maintained to a standard where they could be rapidly returned to service as fire support vessels, pending the development of a superior fire support vessel. The U.S. Marine Corps believes that the current naval surface fire support gun and missile programs will not be able to provide adequate fire support for an <!--del_lnk--> amphibious assault or onshore operations.</p>

       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy_and_doctrine">Strategy and doctrine</span></h2>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Doctrine">Doctrine</span></h3>
       <p>Battleships were the embodiment of <!--del_lnk--> sea power. For <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Thayer Mahan and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas. Mahan's theory, proposed in 1890's <!--del_lnk--> <i>The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660&ndash;1783</i>, dictated the role of the battleship was to sweep the enemy from the seas. While the work of escorting, <!--del_lnk--> blockading, and raiding might be done by <!--del_lnk--> cruisers or smaller vessels, the presence of the battleship was a potential threat to any convoy escorted by any vessels other than capital ships. (This concept came to be known as a "<!--del_lnk--> fleet in being".) Mahan went on to say victory could only be achieved by engagements between battleships, (which came to be known as the "decisive battle" doctrine in <a href="../../wp/i/Imperial_Japanese_Navy.htm" title="Imperial Japanese Navy">some navies</a>), while targeting merchant ships (<!--del_lnk--> commerce raiding or <i>guerre de course</i>, as posited by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Jeune &Eacute;cole</i>) could never succeed.</p>
       <p>Mahan was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship, calling for a large fleet of the most powerful battleships possible. Mahan's work developed in the late 1880s, and by the end of the 1890s it had a massive international impact, in the end adopted by many major navies (notably the British, American, German, and Japanese). The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races, and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era.</p>
       <p>The "fleet in being" suggested battleships could simply by their existence tie down superior enemy resources. This in turn was believed to be able to tip the balance of a conflict even without a battle. This suggested even for inferior naval powers a battleship fleet could have important strategic impact.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tactics">Tactics</span></h3>
       <p>While the role of battleships in both World Wars reflected Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike the <!--del_lnk--> ship of the line, the battleships of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines, weapons which could be used by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The <i>Jeune &Eacute;cole</i> school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s recommended placing <!--del_lnk--> torpedo boats alongside battleships; these would hide behind the battleships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes. While this tactic was vitiated by the development of smokeless propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft (later including submarines) remained. By the 1890s the Royal Navy had developed the first <a href="../../wp/d/Destroyer.htm" title="Destroyer">destroyers</a>, which were initially designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a protective screen of destroyers.</p>
       <p>Battleship doctrine emphasised the concentration of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force to be able to bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages <!--del_lnk--> battlecruisers, <!--del_lnk--> cruisers, destroyers, <a href="../../wp/a/Airship.htm" title="Airship">airships</a>, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, <!--del_lnk--> direction finding and <!--del_lnk--> traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Strategic_and_diplomatic_impact">Strategic and diplomatic impact</span></h3>
       <p>The presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> today, the ownership of battleships served to enhance a nation's force projection.</p>
       <p>Even during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, the psychological impact of a battleship was significant. In 1946, USS <i>Missouri</i> was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the <!--del_lnk--> Balkan region. In September 1983, when <!--del_lnk--> Druze militia in <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>'s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS <i>New Jersey</i> stopped the firing. Gunfire from <i>New Jersey</i> later killed militia leaders.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Value_for_money">Value for money</span></h3>
       <p>Battleships were the largest and most complex, and hence the most expensive warships of their time; as a result, the value of investment in battleships has always been contested. As the French politician Etienne Lamy wrote in 1879, "The construction of battleships is so costly, their effectiveness so uncertain and of such short duration, that the enterprise of creating an armored fleet seems to leave fruitless the perseverance of a people". The <i><!--del_lnk--> Jeune &Eacute;cole</i> school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s sought alternatives to the crippling expense and debatable utility of a conventional battlefleet. It proposed what would nowadays be termed a <!--del_lnk--> sea denial strategy, based on fast, long-ranged cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boat flotillas to attack enemy ships attempting to blockade French ports. The ideas of the <i>Jeune Ecole</i> were ahead of their time; it was not until the 20th century that efficient mines, torpedoes, submarines, and aircraft were available that allowed similar ideas to be effectively implemented.</p>
       <p>The determination of powers such as the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticised by historians, who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet which has no chance of matching its opponent in an actual battle. According to this view, attempts by a weaker navy to compete head-to-head with a stronger one in battleship construction simply wasted resources which could have been better invested in attacking the enemy's points of weakness. In Germany's case, the British dependence on massive imports of food and raw materials proved to be a near-fatal weakness, once Germany had accepted the political risk of <!--del_lnk--> unrestricted submarine warfare against commercial shipping. Although the U-boat offensive in 1917&ndash;18 was ultimately defeated, it was successful in causing huge material loss and forcing the Allies to divert vast resources into <!--del_lnk--> anti-submarine warfare. This success, though not ultimately decisive, was nevertheless in sharp contrast to the inability of the German battlefleet to challenge the supremacy of Britain's far stronger fleet.</p>
