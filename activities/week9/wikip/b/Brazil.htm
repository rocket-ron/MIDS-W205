       <p>Brazil was a colony of <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> beginning from the landing of <!--del_lnk--> Pedro &Aacute;lvares Cabral in 1500, up until 1815, when it was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. The colonial bond was in fact broken several years earlier, in 1808, when the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese colonial empire was <!--del_lnk--> transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, after Napoleon invaded Portugal. <!--del_lnk--> Independence was achieved in 1822 with the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The country became a presidential republic in 1889, when a military <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> <!--del_lnk--> proclaimed the Republic, although the bicameral legislature, now called <!--del_lnk--> Congress, dates back to the ratification of the first constitution in 1824. Its current <!--del_lnk--> Constitution, formulated in 1988, defines Brazil as a federal republic. The Federation is formed by the union of the <!--del_lnk--> Federal District, the 26 <!--del_lnk--> States, and the 5,564 <!--del_lnk--> Municipalities.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian economy is the world's <!--del_lnk--> seventh largest by nominal <a href="../../wp/g/Gross_domestic_product.htm" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> seventh largest by purchasing power parity, as of 2012. Brazil is one of the world's fastest growing major economies, and its economic reforms have given the country new international recognition and influence. Brazil is a founding member of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> G20, <!--del_lnk--> CPLP, <!--del_lnk--> Latin Union, the <!--del_lnk--> Organization of Ibero-American States, the <!--del_lnk--> Organization of American States, <!--del_lnk--> Mercosul and the <!--del_lnk--> Union of South American Nations, and is one of the <!--del_lnk--> BRIC countries. Brazil is also one of the 17 <!--del_lnk--> megadiverse countries, home to diverse <!--del_lnk--> wildlife, <!--del_lnk--> natural environments, and extensive natural resources in a variety of <!--del_lnk--> protected habitats. Brazil is considered a <!--del_lnk--> middle power in international affairs, and has been identified as a potential superpower.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>The word "Brazil" comes from <!--del_lnk--> brazilwood, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast. In Portuguese, brazilwood is called <i>pau-brasil</i>, with the word <i>brasil</i> commonly given the etymology "red like an ember", formed from Latin <i>brasa</i> ("ember") and the suffix <i>-il</i> (from <i>-iculum</i> or <i>-ilium</i>). As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil. Through the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples (mostly <!--del_lnk--> Tupi) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders (mostly Portuguese, but also French) in return for assorted European consumer goods.</p>
       <p>The official name of the land, in original Portuguese records, was the "Land of the Holy Cross" (<i>Terra da Santa Cruz</i>), but European sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the "Land of Brazil" (<i>Terra do Brasil</i>) on account of the brazilwood trade. The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official name. Early sailors sometimes also called it the "Land of Parrots" (<i>Terra di Papaga</i>).</p>
       <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Guarani language, an official language of <a href="../../wp/p/Paraguay.htm" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, Brazil is called "Pindorama". This was the name the natives gave to the region, meaning "land of the palm trees".</p>

       </div>
       <p>The land now called Brazil was claimed by Portugal in April 1500, on the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by <!--del_lnk--> Pedro &Aacute;lvares Cabral. The Portuguese encountered stone age natives divided into several tribes, most of whom spoke languages of the <!--del_lnk--> Tupi&ndash;Guarani family, and fought among themselves. Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization was effectively begun in 1534, when King <!--del_lnk--> Dom <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o&nbsp;III of Portugal divided the territory into twelve hereditary captaincies.</p>
       <p>This arrangement proved problematic, and in 1549 the king assigned a <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General to administer the entire colony. The Portuguese assimilated some of the native tribes while others were enslaved or exterminated in long wars or by European diseases to which they had no immunity. By the mid-16th century, sugar had become Brazil's most important export and the Portuguese imported African slaves to cope with the increasing international demand.</p>
       <p>Through wars against the French, the Portuguese slowly expanded their territory to the southeast, taking <a href="../../wp/r/Rio_de_Janeiro.htm" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> in 1567, and to the northwest, taking <!--del_lnk--> S&atilde;o Lu&iacute;s in 1615. They sent military expeditions to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Amazon_rainforest.htm" title="Amazon Rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a> and conquered British and Dutch strongholds, founding villages and forts from 1669. In 1680 they reached the far south and founded <!--del_lnk--> Sacramento on the bank of the <!--del_lnk--> Rio de la Plata, in the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Bank region.</p>

       <p>At the end of the 17th century, sugar exports started to decline but beginning in the 1690s, the discovery of gold by <!--del_lnk--> explorers in the region that would later be called <!--del_lnk--> Minas Gerais in current <!--del_lnk--> Mato Grosso and <!--del_lnk--> Goi&aacute;s, saved the colony from imminent collapse. From all over Brazil, as well as from Portugal, thousands of immigrants went to the mines. The Spanish tried to prevent Portuguese expansion into the territory that belonged to them according to the <!--del_lnk--> 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, and succeeded in conquering the Eastern Bank in 1777. However, this was in vain as the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of San Ildefonso, signed in the same year, confirmed Portuguese sovereignty over all lands proceeding from its territorial expansion, thus creating most of the current Brazilian borders.</p>
       <p>In 1808, the Portuguese royal family and the majority of the Portuguese nobility, fleeing the troops of the French Emperor <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Napoleon.htm" title="Napoleon I">Napoleon&nbsp;I</a> that were <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">invading</a> Portugal and most of Central Europe, <!--del_lnk--> established themselves in the city of Rio de Janeiro, which thus became the seat of the entire Portuguese Empire. In 1815 Dom <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o&nbsp;VI, then regent on behalf of his incapacitated mother, elevated Brazil from colony to sovereign <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom united with Portugal. In 1809 the Portuguese invaded <a href="../../wp/f/French_Guiana.htm" title="French Guiana">French Guiana</a> (which was returned to France in 1817) and in 1816 the Eastern Bank, subsequently renamed <!--del_lnk--> Cisplatina.</p>

       </div>
       <p>After the Portuguese military had successfully <!--del_lnk--> repelled Napoleon's invasion of Portugal, Jo&atilde;o&nbsp;VI returned to Europe in April 1821, leaving his elder son Prince Pedro de Alc&acirc;ntara as regent to rule Brazil. The Portuguese government, guided by the new political regime imposed by the <!--del_lnk--> Liberal Revolution of 1820, attempted to turn Brazil into a colony once again, thus depriving it of its achievements since 1808. The Brazilians refused to yield and Prince Pedro stood by them declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822.</p>
       <p>On 12 October 1822, he was declared the first Emperor of Brazil and crowned Dom <!--del_lnk--> Pedro&nbsp;I on 1 December 1822. At that time most Brazilians were in favour of a monarchy and republicanism had little support. The subsequent <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian War of Independence spread through almost the entire territory, with battles in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824 and independence was recognized by Portugal on 29 August 1825.</p>
       <p>Pedro&nbsp;I abdicated on 7 April 1831 and went to Europe to <!--del_lnk--> reclaim his daughter&rsquo;s crown which had been usurped by his brother, leaving behind his five-year-old son and heir, who became Dom <!--del_lnk--> Pedro&nbsp;II. As the new emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he reached maturity, a regency was created. Disputes between political factions led to rebellions and an unstable, almost anarchical, regency. The rebellious factions, however, were not in revolt against the monarchy, even though some declared the secession of the provinces as independent republics, but only so long as Pedro&nbsp;II was a minor. Because of this, he was prematurely declared of age and "Brazil was to enjoy nearly half a century of internal peace and rapid material progress."</p>
       <p>Despite the <!--del_lnk--> loss of Cisplatina in 1828 when it became an independent nation known as Uruguay, Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro&nbsp;II (the <!--del_lnk--> Platine War, the <!--del_lnk--> Uruguayan War and the <!--del_lnk--> Paraguayan War) and witnessed the consolidation of <!--del_lnk--> representative democracy, mainly due to successive elections and unrestricted freedom of the press. Most importantly, slavery was extinguished after a slow but steady process that began with the end of the international traffic in slaves in 1850 and ended with the complete abolition of slavery in 1888. The slave population had been in decline since Brazil's independence: in 1823, 29% of the Brazilian population were slaves but by 1887 this had fallen to 5%.</p>
       <p>When the monarchy was overthrown on 15 November 1889 there was little desire in Brazil to change the form of government and Pedro&nbsp;II was at the height of his popularity among his subjects. However, he "bore prime, perhaps sole, responsibility for his own overthrow." After the death of his two sons, the Emperor believed that "the imperial regime was destined to end with him." He cared little for the regime's fate and so neither did anything, nor allowed anyone else to do anything, to prevent the military coup, backed by former slave owners who resented the abolition of slavery.</p>

He ruled the country <!--del_lnk--> for fifteen years.</div>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The "early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship, with army dominating affairs both at Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power". In 1894, following several military and economic crises, the republican civilians rose to power.</p>
       <p>Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate <!--del_lnk--> Get&uacute;lio Vargas supported by most of the military, led a <!--del_lnk--> successful revolt. Vargas was supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with his supporters. Between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove Vargas from power occurred. The second one being the 1935 <!--del_lnk--> communist revolt which served as an excuse for the preclusion of elections, put into effect by a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> in 1937, which made the <!--del_lnk--> Vargas regime a full dictatorship, noted for its brutality and censorship of the press.</p>
       <p>In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period, was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, after <!--del_lnk--> its involvement in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>.

       <p>With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, being the Democracy "reinstated" by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before. Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Several brief interim governments succeeded after Vargas's suicide. <!--del_lnk--> Juscelino Kubitscheck became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises. The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably, but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of <!--del_lnk--> Bras&iacute;lia, inaugurated in 1960. His successor was <!--del_lnk--> J&acirc;nio Quadros, who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office. His vice-president, <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o Goulart, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition and was <!--del_lnk--> deposed in April 1964 by a coup that resulted in a <!--del_lnk--> military regime.</p>
       <p>The new regime was intended to be transitory but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968. The repression of the dictatorship's opponents, including urban guerrillas, was harsh, but not as brutal as in other Latin American countries. Due to the extraordinary economic growth, known as an "economic miracle", the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the years of repression.</p>
       <p>General <!--del_lnk--> Ernesto Geisel became president in 1974 and began his project of re-democratization through a process that he said would be "slow, gradual and safe." Geisel ended the military indiscipline that had plagued the country since 1889, as well as the torture of political prisoners, censorship of the press, and finally, the dictatorship itself, after he extinguished the Fifth Institutional Act. However, the military regime continued, under his chosen successor General <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o Figueiredo, to complete the transition to full democracy.</p>
       <p>The civilians fully returned to power in 1985 when <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Sarney assumed the presidency but, by the end of his term, he had become extremely unpopular due to the uncontrollable economic crisis and unusually high inflation. Sarney's unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown <!--del_lnk--> Fernando Collor, who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992. Collor was succeeded by his Vice-President <!--del_lnk--> Itamar Franco, who appointed <!--del_lnk--> Fernando Henrique Cardoso as Minister of Finance. Cardoso produced a highly successful <!--del_lnk--> Plano Real. that granted stability to the Brazilian economy and he was elected as president in 1994 and again in 1998. The peaceful transition of power to <!--del_lnk--> Lu&iacute;s In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, who was elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006, proved that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving its long-sought political stability. Lula was succeeded in 2011 by the current president, <!--del_lnk--> Dilma Rousseff.</p>

It also encompasses a number of oceanic <!--del_lnk--> archipelagos, such as <!--del_lnk--> Fernando de Noronha, <!--del_lnk--> Rocas Atoll, <!--del_lnk--> Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, and <!--del_lnk--> Trindade and Martim Vaz. Its size, relief, climate, and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse. Including its <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Altantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> islands, Brazil lies between latitudes <!--del_lnk--> 6&deg;N and <!--del_lnk--> 34&deg;S, and longitudes <!--del_lnk--> 28&deg; and <!--del_lnk--> 74&deg;W.</p>
       <p>Brazil is the <!--del_lnk--> fifth largest country in the world, and third largest in the Americas, with a total area of 8,514,876.599 km<sup>2</sup> (3,287,612&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), including 55,455&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (21,411&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of water. It spans three <a href="../../wp/t/Time_zone.htm" title="Time zone">time zones</a>; from <!--del_lnk--> UTC-4 in the western states, to <!--del_lnk--> UTC-3 in the eastern states (and the official time of Brazil) and <!--del_lnk--> UTC-2 in the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic islands. Brazil is the only country in the world that lies on the <a href="../../wp/e/Equator.htm" title="Equator">equator</a> while having contiguous territory outside the tropics.</p>
       <p>Brazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills, mountains, plains, highlands, and scrublands. Much of the terrain lies between 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft) and 800 metres (2,600&nbsp;ft) in elevation. The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country. The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad, rolling terrain broken by low, rounded hills.</p>
       <p>The southeastern section is more rugged, with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1,200 metres (3,900&nbsp;ft). These ranges include the <!--del_lnk--> Mantiqueira and <!--del_lnk--> Espinha&ccedil;o mountains and the <!--del_lnk--> Serra do Mar. In the north, the <!--del_lnk--> Guiana Highlands form a major drainage divide, separating rivers that flow south into the <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_Basin.htm" title="Amazon Basin">Amazon Basin</a> from rivers that empty into the <!--del_lnk--> Orinoco River system, in Venezuela, to the north. The highest point in Brazil is the <!--del_lnk--> Pico da Neblina at 2,994 metres (9,823&nbsp;ft), and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
       <p>Brazil has a dense and complex system of rivers, one of the world's most extensive, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the Atlantic. Major rivers include the <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_River.htm" title="Amazon River">Amazon</a> (the world's second-longest river and the largest in terms of volume of water), the <!--del_lnk--> Paran&aacute; and its major tributary the <!--del_lnk--> Igua&ccedil;u (which includes the <!--del_lnk--> Iguazu Falls), the <!--del_lnk--> Negro, <!--del_lnk--> S&atilde;o Francisco, <!--del_lnk--> Xingu, <!--del_lnk--> Madeira and <!--del_lnk--> Tapaj&oacute;s rivers.</p>

       <p>The climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical. According to the <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;ppen system, Brazil hosts five major climatic subtypes: <!--del_lnk--> equatorial, <!--del_lnk--> tropical, <!--del_lnk--> semiarid, <!--del_lnk--> highland tropical, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Temperateness.htm" title="Temperateness">temperate</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Subtropics.htm" title="Subtropics">subtropical</a>. The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from <!--del_lnk--> equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to <!--del_lnk--> temperate coniferous forests in the south and <!--del_lnk--> tropical savannas in central Brazil. Many regions have starkly different <!--del_lnk--> microclimates.</p>
       <p>An equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil. There is no real <!--del_lnk--> dry season, but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls. Temperatures average <span style="white-space:nowrap;">25 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(77&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons.</p>
       <p>Over central Brazil rainfall is more seasonal, characteristic of a savanna climate. This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude. In the interior northeast, seasonal rainfall is even more extreme. The semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimetres (31.5&nbsp;in) of rain, most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year and occasionally less than this, creating long periods of drought. Brazil's 1877&ndash;78 <i>Grande Seca</i> (Great Drought), the most severe ever recorded in Brazil, caused approximately half a million deaths. The one from 1915 was devastating too.</p>
       <p>South of Bahia, near the coasts, and more southerly most of the state of S&atilde;o Paulo, the distribution of rainfall changes, with rain falling throughout the year. The south enjoys temperate conditions, with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding <span style="white-space:nowrap;">18 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(64.4&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>; winter frosts are quite common, <!--del_lnk--> with occasional snowfall in the higher areas. Other kinds of solid precipitation happen in a wider area, including cities as <a href="../../wp/r/Rio_de_Janeiro.htm#Climate" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> and S&atilde;o Paulo. Fall of snow grains and ice pellets, deemed as not dissimilar from true hail, are popularly called <i>granizo</i>.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biodiversity">Biodiversity</span></h3>
       <p>Brazil's large territory comprises different ecosystems, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Amazon_rainforest.htm" title="Amazon Rainforest">Amazon Rainforest</a>, recognized as having the greatest <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">biological diversity</a> in the world, with the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Forest and the <!--del_lnk--> Cerrado, sustaining the greatest biodiversity. In the south, the <!--del_lnk--> Araucaria pine forest grows under temperate conditions. The rich wildlife of Brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats. Scientists estimate that the total number of <!--del_lnk--> plant and <!--del_lnk--> animal species in Brazil could approach four million.</p>

Concern for the environment has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues.</p>
       <p>Biodiversity can contribute to <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, livestock, forestry and fisheries extraction. However, almost all economically exploited species of plants, such as soybeans and coffee, or animals, such as chicken, are imported from other countries, and the economic use of native species still crawls. In the Brazilian GDP, the forest sector represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%.</p>
       <p>A single drug for controlling hypertension, developed with the venom of the <!--del_lnk--> jararaca - a Brazilian species, would yield about $1.5 billion a year to a foreign laboratory that has patented. This is a value comparable to the national exports of beef and pork combined.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environment">Environment</span></h3>
       <p>The natural heritage of Brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture, logging, mining, resettlement, oil and gas extraction, over-fishing, wildlife trade, dams and infrastructure, water pollution, climate change, fire, and invasive species. In many areas of the country, the natural environment is threatened by development. Construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement; dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats; and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape. At least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region, including controversial <!--del_lnk--> Belo Monte hydroelectric dam.</p>

       <p>The Brazilian Federation is the "indissoluble union" of three distinct political entities: the States, the Municipalities and the Federal District. The Union, the states and the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the "spheres of government." The Federation is set on five fundamental principles: sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism. The classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative, and judicial under a checks and balances system), is formally established by the Constitution. The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state/Federal District spheres.</p>
       <p>All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected. Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams. For most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, proportional representation. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.</p>
       <p>Together with several smaller parties, four political parties stand out: <!--del_lnk--> Workers' Party (PT), <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), and <!--del_lnk--> Democrats (DEM). Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly. Almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the Executive.</p>
       <p>The form of government is that of a democratic republic, with a presidential system. The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term, with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is <!--del_lnk--> Dilma Rousseff who was inaugurated on 1 January 2011. The President appoints the <!--del_lnk--> Ministers of State, who assist in government. Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The <!--del_lnk--> National Congress is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the <!--del_lnk--> Chamber of Deputies and the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Senate. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Brazilian law is based on <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_law.htm" title="Roman law">Roman</a>-<!--del_lnk--> Germanic traditions and <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_law_%2528legal_system%2529.htm" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a> concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases.</p>
       <p>The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, which was promulgated on 5 October 1988, and is the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules. As of April 2007, there have been 53 amendments. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution. Municipalities and the Federal District have "organic laws" (<span lang="pt"><i>leis org&acirc;nicas</i></span>), which act in a similar way to constitutions. Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms. Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments. There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts. The highest court is the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Federal Court.</p>
       <p>This system has been criticised over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision making. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve, and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings. Nevertheless, the Supreme Federal Tribunal was the first court in the world to transmit its sessions on television, and also via <a href="../../wp/y/YouTube.htm" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>. More recently, in December 2009, the Supreme Court adopted <a href="../../wp/t/Twitter.htm" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> to display items on the day planner of the ministers, to inform the daily actions of the Court and the most important decisions made by them.</p>
       <p>Brazil continues to have high crime rates in a number of statistics, despite recent improvements. More than 500,000 people have been killed by firearms in Brazil between 1979 and 2003, according to a new report by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. In 2010, there were 473,600 people incarcerated in Brazilian prisons and jails.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Foreign_Policy">Foreign Policy</span></h3>
       <p>Although some social and economic problems prevent Brazil from exercising effective global power, the country is now a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Political">political</a> and <!--del_lnk--> economic leader in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>. This claim, however, is partially challenged by other countries, such as <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, who oppose the Brazilian goal of obtaining a permanent seat as representative of the region in the Security Council of the United Nations. Between World War II and the 1990s, democratic and military governments sought to expand Brazil's influence in the world, pursuing a common foreign and independent <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industry</a>. Currently the country has aimed to strengthen ties with other South American countries and pursue multilateral diplomacy through the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Organization of American States.</p>
       <p>The current Brazil's foreign policy is based on the country's position as a <!--del_lnk--> regional power in Latin America, a leader among developing countries and an emerging world superpower. Brazilian foreign policy has generally reflected multilateralism, resolving disputes peacefully and non-intervention in the affairs of other <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Country.htm" title="Countries">countries</a>. The Brazilian <!--del_lnk--> Constitution also determines that the country shall seek an economic, political, social and cultural ties with the nations of Latin America.</p>
       <p>An increasingly well-developed tool of Brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries. Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid, but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all, a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels. Total aid is estimated to be around $1 billion per year that includes:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>technical cooperation of around $480 million ($30 million in 2010 provided directly by the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC))</li>
        <li>an estimated $450 million for in-kind expertise provided by Brazilian institutions specialising in technical cooperation</li>
       </ul>
       <p>In addition, Brazil manages a peacekeeping mission in <!--del_lnk--> Haiti ($350 million) and makes in-kind contributions to the <!--del_lnk--> World Food Programme ($300 million). This is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies. The scale of this aid places it on par with China and India and ahead of many western donors. The Brazilian South-South aid has been described as a "global model in waiting."</p>

       <p>Brazil is a federation composed of 26 <!--del_lnk--> States, one <!--del_lnk--> Federal district (which contains the capital city, <!--del_lnk--> Bras&iacute;lia) and <!--del_lnk--> Municipalities. States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can only be voted by the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.</p>
       <p>The states and the federal district may be grouped into regions: <!--del_lnk--> Northern, <!--del_lnk--> Northeast, <!--del_lnk--> Central-West, <!--del_lnk--> Southeast and <!--del_lnk--> Southern. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes, and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects.</p>
       <p>Municipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Union and state government. Each has a mayor and an elected legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called <i><!--del_lnk--> comarca</i> (county).</p>

As a sign of its economic progress, Brazil has now the fourth largest car market in the world.</p>
       <p>Brazil pegged its currency, the <!--del_lnk--> real, to the U.S. dollar in 1994. However, after the <!--del_lnk--> East Asian financial crisis, the <!--del_lnk--> Russian default in 1998 and the series of adverse financial events that followed it, the <!--del_lnk--> Central Bank of Brazil temporarily changed its <!--del_lnk--> monetary policy to a managed-float scheme while undergoing a <!--del_lnk--> currency crisis, until definitively changing the exchange regime to free-float in January 1999.</p>
       <p>Brazil received an International Monetary Fund rescue package in mid-2002 of $30.4&nbsp;billion, then a record sum. Brazil's central bank paid back the IMF loan in 2005, although it was not due to be repaid until 2006. One of the issues the Central Bank of Brazil recently dealt with was an excess of speculative short-term capital inflows to the country, which may have contributed to a fall in the value of the U.S. dollar against the real during that period. Nonetheless, <!--del_lnk--> foreign direct investment (FDI), related to long-term, less speculative investment in production, is estimated to be $193.8&nbsp;billion for 2007. Inflation monitoring and control currently plays a major part in the Central bank's role of setting out short-term <!--del_lnk--> interest rates as a monetary policy measure.</p>
       <p>Between 1993 and 2010, 7012 <!--del_lnk--> mergers &amp; acquisitions with a total known value of $707 billion with the involvement of Brazlian firms have been announced. The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with 115 billion USD of transactions. The largest transaction with involvement of Brazilian companies has been: <!--del_lnk--> Cia Vale do Rio Doce acquired <!--del_lnk--> Inco in a tender offer valued at $18.9 billion USD.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> purchasing power in Brazil is eroded by the so-called <!--del_lnk--> Brazil cost.</p>

Also according to the National Household Survey, the percentage of people at <a href="../../wp/s/School.htm" title="School">school</a>, in 2007, was 97% in the age group 6&ndash;14 years and 82.1% among people 15 to 17 years, while the average total time of study among those over 10 years was on average 6.9 years.</p>
       <p>Higher education starts with undergraduate or sequential <!--del_lnk--> courses, which may offer different options of specialization in academic or professional careers.

       <p>The Brazilian press has its beginnings in 1808 with the arrival of the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> royal <a href="../../wp/f/Family.htm" title="Family">family</a> to Brazil, hitherto forbidden any activity of the press - was the publication of newspapers or books. The Brazilian press was officially born in <a href="../../wp/r/Rio_de_Janeiro.htm" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> on May 13, 1808, with the creation of the Royal Printing, National Press by the <!--del_lnk--> Prince <!--del_lnk--> Regent <!--del_lnk--> Dom Jo&atilde;o.</p>
       <p>The Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro, the first newspaper published in the country, begins to circulate on September 10, 1808. Currently the press has established itself as a means of mass communication and produced major newspapers today are among the largest in the country and the world as Folha de S. Paulo, O Globo and Estado de S. Paul, publications and publishers of April and Globe.</p>
       <p>The broadcast came on September 7, 1922, being the first broadcast a speech by then President Pessoa, but installing the radio actually occurred only on 20 April 1923 with the creation of "Radio Society of Rio de Janeiro." In the 1930s the era of <!--del_lnk--> commercial<a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio</a>, with the permission of commercial programming, bringing hiring artists and technical development for the sector. With the rise of popularity of soap operas and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Computer_programming.htm" title="Programming">programming</a> in the 1940s, began to call the golden age of Brazilian radio, which brought an impact on Brazilian society similar to that television produces today. With the creation of television, the radio goes through transformations, the humor programs, artists, soap operas and talk shows are replaced with songs and utilities. In the 1960s came the radio FMs that bring more music to the listener.</p>
       <p>Television in Brazil began officially on September 18, 1950, brought by Assis Chateaubriand who founded the first <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> <!--del_lnk--> channel in the country, TV Tupi. Since then television has grown in the country, creating large networks such as Globo,SBT,Record and Bandeirantes. Today, television is the most important factor in modern popular culture of Brazilian society. Digital TV in Brazil started at 20:30, 2 December 2007, initially in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/S%25C3%25A3o_Paulo.htm" title="City of S&atilde;o Paulo">city of S&atilde;o Paulo</a>, the Japanese standard.</p>
       <p>In May 2010,Brazil has launched <!--del_lnk--> TV Brasil Internacional, an international <!--del_lnk--> television station, initially broadcasting to 49 countries. <!--del_lnk--> Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, former President of Brazil, described its aim as "presenting Brazil to the world."</p>

       </div>
       <p>The population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million (22.31 inhabitants per square kilometer), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1 and 83.75% of the population defined as urban. The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeastern (79.8 million inhabitants) and Northeastern (53.5 million inhabitants) regions, while the two most extensive regions, the Centre-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of the Brazilian territory, have a total of only 29.1 million inhabitants.</p>
       <p>The first census in Brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478. From 1880 to 1930, 4 million Europeans arrived. Brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970, due to a decline in the <!--del_lnk--> mortality rate, even though the <!--del_lnk--> birth rate underwent a slight decline. In the 1940s the annual <!--del_lnk--> population growth rate was 2.4%, rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s, as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years and to 72.6 years in 2007. It has been steadily falling since the 1960s, from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of&nbsp;&ndash;0.29% by 2050 thus completing the <!--del_lnk--> demographic transition.</p>
       <p>In 2008, the illiteracy rate was 11.48% and among the youth (ages 15&ndash;19) 1.74%. It was highest (20.30%) in the Northeast, which had a large proportion of rural poor. Illiteracy was high (24.18%) among the rural population and lower (9.05%) among the urban population.</p>

       <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> National Research by Household Sample (PNAD) of 2008, 48.43% of the population (about 92 million) described themselves as <!--del_lnk--> White; 43.80% (about 83 million) as <!--del_lnk--> Brown (<!--del_lnk--> Multiracial), 6.84% (about 13 million) as <!--del_lnk--> Black; 0.58% (about 1.1 million) as <!--del_lnk--> Asian; and 0.28% (about 536 thousand) as <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian (officially called <i>ind&iacute;gena</i>, Indigenous), while 0.07% (about 130 thousand) did not declare their race.</p>
       <p>In 2007, the <!--del_lnk--> National Indian Foundation reported the existence of 67 different uncontacted tribes, up from 40 in 2005. Brazil is believed to have the largest number of <!--del_lnk--> uncontacted peoples in the world.</p>

       <p>Brazilian society is more <!--del_lnk--> markedly divided by <!--del_lnk--> social class lines, although a high <!--del_lnk--> income disparity is found <!--del_lnk--> between race groups, so <!--del_lnk--> racism and <!--del_lnk--> classism can be conflated. Socially significant closeness to one racial group <!--del_lnk--> is taken in account more in the basis of appearance (<!--del_lnk--> phenotypes) rather than ancestry, to the extent that full <!--del_lnk--> siblings can pertain to different "racial" groups. <!--del_lnk--> Socioeconomic factors are also significant, because a minority of <i><!--del_lnk--> pardos</i> are likely to start declaring themselves White or Black if socially upward. Skin colour and facial features do not line quite well with ancestry (usually, Afro-Brazilians are evenly mixed and European ancestry is dominant in Whites and <i>pardos</i> with a significant non-European contribution, but the individual variation is great).</p>
       <p>The brown population (as multiracial Brazilians are officially called; <i><!--del_lnk--> pardo</i> in Portuguese, also colloquially <i><!--del_lnk--> moreno</i>, or <!--del_lnk--> swarthy) is a broad category that includes <i><!--del_lnk--> caboclos</i> (assimilated Amerindians in general, and descendants of Whites and Natives), <i><!--del_lnk--> mulatos</i> (descendants of primarily Whites and Afro-Brazilians) and <i><!--del_lnk--> cafuzos</i> (descendants of Afro-Brazilians and Natives). People of considerable Amerindian ancestry form the majority of the population in the Northern, Northeastern and Centre-Western regions.</p>
       <p>Higher percents of Blacks, mulattoes and tri-racials can be found in the eastern coast of the Northeastern region from Bahia to Para&iacute;ba and also in northern Maranh&atilde;o, southern Minas Gerais and in eastern Rio de Janeiro. From the 19th century, Brazil opened its borders to <!--del_lnk--> immigration. About five million people from over 60 countries migrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1972, most of them of <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese, <!--del_lnk--> Italian, <!--del_lnk--> Spaniard, <!--del_lnk--> German, <!--del_lnk--> Japanese and <!--del_lnk--> Middle Eastern origin.</p>

       <p>Brazil possesses a richly spiritual society formed from the meeting of the Roman Catholic Church with the religious traditions of African slaves and indigenous peoples. This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of Brazilian Roman Catholicism, characterized by traditional Portuguese festivities, and in some instances, <!--del_lnk--> Allan Kardec's <!--del_lnk--> Spiritism (most Brazilian Spiritists are also <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a>). Religious pluralism increased during the 20th century, and a Protestant community has grown to include over 15% of the population. The most common Protestant denominations are <!--del_lnk--> Pentecostal, <!--del_lnk--> Evangelical, <a href="../../wp/b/Baptists.htm" title="Baptists">Baptist</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Seventh-day Adventist, <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran and the <!--del_lnk--> reformed churches.</p>
       <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> is the country's predominant faith. Brazil has the world's largest Catholic population. According to the 2000 Demographic Census (the PNAD survey does not inquire about religion), 73.57% of the population followed <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholicism; 15.41% <!--del_lnk--> Protestantism; 1.33% Kardecist spiritism; 1.22% other Christian denominations; 0.31% Afro-Brazilian religions; 0.13% <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>; 0.05% <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>; 0.02% <!--del_lnk--> Islam; 0.01% Amerindian religions; 0.59% other religions, undeclared or undetermined; while 7.35% have no religion.</p>
       <p>However, in the last ten years Protestantism, particularly Pentecostal and/or Evangelical Protestantism, has spread in Brazil, while the proportion of Catholics has dropped significantly. After Protestantism, individuals professing no religion are also a significant group, exceeding 7% of the population in the 2000 census. The cities of <!--del_lnk--> Boa Vista, <!--del_lnk--> Salvador and <!--del_lnk--> Porto Velho have the greatest proportion of <!--del_lnk--> Irreligious residents in Brazil. <!--del_lnk--> Teresina, <!--del_lnk--> Fortaleza, and <!--del_lnk--> Florian&oacute;polis were the most Roman Catholic in the country. <!--del_lnk--> Greater Rio de Janeiro, not including the <a href="../../wp/r/Rio_de_Janeiro.htm" title="Rio de Janeiro">city proper</a>, is the most Irreligious and least Roman Catholic Brazilian periphery, while <!--del_lnk--> Greater Porto Alegre and Greater <!--del_lnk--> Fortaleza are in the opposite sides of the lists respectively.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Language">Language</span></h3>
       <p>The official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes. The most famous exception to this is a strong <!--del_lnk--> sign language law that was passed by the <!--del_lnk--> National Congress of Brazil. Legally recognized in 2002, the law was <!--del_lnk--> regulated in 2005. The law mandates the use of the <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian Sign Language, more commonly known by its Portuguese <!--del_lnk--> acronym LIBRAS, in education and government services. The language must be taught as a part of the <!--del_lnk--> education and <!--del_lnk--> speech and language pathology curricula. LIBRAS teachers, instructors and translators are recognized professionals. Schools and health services must provide access ("<!--del_lnk--> inclusion") to <!--del_lnk--> deaf people.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Brazilian Portuguese has had its own development, mostly similar to 16th century Central and Southern dialects of European Portuguese (despite a very substantial number of Portuguese colonial settlers, and <!--del_lnk--> more recent immigrants, coming from <!--del_lnk--> Northern regions, and in minor degree Portuguese <!--del_lnk--> Macaronesia), with some influences from the <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian and <!--del_lnk--> African languages, especially <a href="../../wp/w/West_Africa.htm" title="West Africa">West African</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Bantu. As a result, the language is somewhat different, mostly in phonology, from the language of Portugal and other <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese-speaking countries (the dialects of the other countries, partly due to the more recent end of <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese colonialism in these regions, have a closer connexion to contemporary <!--del_lnk--> European Portuguese). These differences are comparable to those between <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American</a> and <!--del_lnk--> British English.</p>
       <p>Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors.</p>
       <p>In 1990, the <!--del_lnk--> Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), which included representatives from all countries with Portuguese as the official language, reached an <!--del_lnk--> agreement on the reform of the Portuguese orthography to unify the two standards then in use by Brazil on one side and the remaining lusophone countries on the other. This spelling reform went into effect in Brazil on 1 January 2009. In Portugal, the reform was signed into law by the President on 21 July 2008 allowing for a 6-year adaptation period, during which both orthographies will co-exist. The remaining CPLP countries are free to establish their own transition timetables.</p>
       <p>Minority languages are spoken throughout the nation. One hundred and eighty <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and a significant number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants. In the municipality of <!--del_lnk--> S&atilde;o Gabriel da Cachoeira, <!--del_lnk--> Nheengatu (a currently endangered South American <!--del_lnk--> creole language &ndash; or an 'anti-creole', according to some linguists &ndash; with mostly Indigenous Brazilian languages lexicon and Portuguese-based grammar that, together with its southern relative <!--del_lnk--> l&iacute;ngua geral paulista, once was a major <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca in Brazil, being replaced by Portuguese only after governmental prohibition led by <!--del_lnk--> major political changes), <!--del_lnk--> Baniwa and Tucano languages had been granted co-official status with Portuguese.</p>
       <p>There are significant communities of <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> (mostly the <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian Hunsr&uuml;ckisch, a <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">High German language</a> dialect) and Italian (mostly the <!--del_lnk--> Talian, a <!--del_lnk--> Venetian dialect) origins in the Southern and Southeastern regions, whose ancestors' native languages were carried along to Brazil, and which, still alive there, are influenced by the Portuguese language. Talian is officially a historic patrimony of <!--del_lnk--> Rio Grande do Sul, and two German dialects possess co-official status in a few municipalities.</p>
       <p>Learning at least one second language (generally English and/or Spanish) is mandatory for all the 12 grades of the mandatory <!--del_lnk--> education system (<a href="../../wp/p/Primary_education.htm" title="Primary education">primary</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Secondary_education.htm" title="Secondary education">secondary education</a>, there called <i>ensino fundamental</i> and <i>ensino m&eacute;dio</i> respectively).

The culture was, however, also strongly influenced by <!--del_lnk--> African, <!--del_lnk--> indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.</p>
       <p>Some aspects of Brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of <!--del_lnk--> Italian, <!--del_lnk--> German and other European as well <!--del_lnk--> Japanese and <!--del_lnk--> Arab immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the South and Southeast of Brazil.

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Brazilian art has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from <!--del_lnk--> Baroque (the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century) to <!--del_lnk--> Romanticism, <!--del_lnk--> Modernism, <a href="../../wp/e/Expressionism.htm" title="Expressionism">Expressionism</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">Cubism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Surrealism and <a href="../../wp/a/Abstract_art.htm" title="Abstract art">Abstractionism</a>.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Music">Music</span></h3>
       <p>The music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> and <!--del_lnk--> African elements, respectively brought by <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> colonists and slaves. Until the nineteenth century <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, classical and popular, introducing most of the instruments, the harmonic system, literature and musical good share of musical forms cultivated in the country along the centuries, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. The first was great Brazilian composer Jos&eacute; Maur&iacute;cio Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with remarkable influence of Viennese classicism. The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments that had a bigger role in the development of popular music and folk, flourishing especially from the twentieth century. The <!--del_lnk--> indigenous hardly left their traces in the mainstream, except in some genres of <a href="../../wp/f/Folklore.htm" title="Folklore">folklore</a>, being mostly a passive participant in the impositions of colonial culture.</p>
       <p>With big black participation, popular music since the late eighteenth century began to show signs of forming a characteristically Brazilian sound. In classical music, however, that diversity of elements presented until late in feature rather undifferentiated, following closely - within the local technical possibilities, quite modest compared with major European centers or as <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a> - what happened in Europe and to a lesser degree in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> America in each period, and a character specifically Brazilian national production would only become clear after the great synthesis performed by Villa Lobos, back in the mid-twentieth century.</p>
       <p>Brazilian music encompasses various regional styles influenced by African forms, European and Amerindian. It developed in different styles, including samba, <!--del_lnk--> MPB, nativist music, <a href="../../wp/c/Country_music.htm" title="Country music">country music</a>, <!--del_lnk--> choro, <!--del_lnk--> ax&eacute;, tacky, <!--del_lnk--> forr&oacute;, <!--del_lnk--> frevo, <!--del_lnk--> balloon, <!--del_lnk--> lambada, <!--del_lnk--> maracatu, Brazilian bossa nova and <!--del_lnk--> rock.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Literature">Literature</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Brazilian literature dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as <!--del_lnk--> P&ecirc;ro Vaz de Caminha, filled with descriptions of <!--del_lnk--> fauna, <!--del_lnk--> flora and natives that amazed Europeans that arrived in Brazil. Brazil produced significant works in <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> &mdash; novelists like <!--del_lnk--> Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; de Alencar wrote novels about love and pain. Alencar, in his long career, also treated Indigenous people as heroes in the Indigenist novels <i><!--del_lnk--> O Guarany</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Iracema</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Ubirajara</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Machado de Assis, one of his contemporaries, wrote in virtually all genres and continues to gain international prestige from critics worldwide. The <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian Modernism, evidenced by the <!--del_lnk--> Week of Modern Art in 1922, was concerned with a nationalist avant-garde literature, while <!--del_lnk--> Post-Modernism brought a generation of distinct poets like <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o Cabral de Melo Neto, <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Drummond de Andrade and <!--del_lnk--> Vinicius de Moraes and internationally known writers dealing with universal and regional subjects like <!--del_lnk--> Jorge Amado, <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o Guimar&atilde;es Rosa and <!--del_lnk--> Clarice Lispector.</p>
