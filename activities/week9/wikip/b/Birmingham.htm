       <p><b>Birmingham</b> is a <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city</a> and <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan borough in the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands county of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. It is the <!--del_lnk--> most populous British city outside <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, with a population of 1,028,700 (2009 estimate), and lies at the heart of the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands conurbation, the United Kingdom's <!--del_lnk--> second most populous urban area with a population of 2,284,093 (2001 census). Birmingham's <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area, which includes surrounding towns to which it is closely tied through <!--del_lnk--> commuting, is also the United Kingdom's <!--del_lnk--> second most populous with a population of 3,683,000.</p>
       <p>Birmingham was a powerhouse of the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in England, a fact which led to it being known as "the workshop of the world" or the "city of a thousand trades". Although Birmingham's industrial importance has declined, it has developed into a national commercial centre, being named in 2010 as the third-best place in the United Kingdom to locate a business. Birmingham is a national hub for conferences, retail and events along with an established high tech, research and development sector, supported by its three Universities. It is also the fourth-most visited city by foreign visitors in the UK, has the second-largest city economy in the UK. Birmingham is ranked as a <!--del_lnk--> gamma- world city by the <!--del_lnk--> Globalization and World Cities Research Network.</p>
       <p>In 2010, Birmingham was ranked as the 55th-most livable city in the world, according to the <!--del_lnk--> Mercer Index of worldwide standards of living. The <!--del_lnk--> Big City Plan is a large redevelopment plan currently underway in the <!--del_lnk--> city centre with the aim of making Birmingham one of the top 20 <!--del_lnk--> most liveable cities in the world within 20 years. People from Birmingham are known as '<!--del_lnk--> Brummies', a term derived from the city's nickname of 'Brum'. This may originate from the city's dialect name, <!--del_lnk--> Brummagem, which may in turn have been derived from one of the city's earlier names, 'Bromwicham'. There is a distinctive Brummie <!--del_lnk--> dialect and <!--del_lnk--> accent, both of which differ from the adjacent <!--del_lnk--> Black Country.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>Some of the earliest evidence of settlement in Birmingham are artefacts dating back 10,400 years discovered near Curzon Street in the city centre.</p>
       <p>In the early 7th century, Birmingham was an <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon farming <!--del_lnk--> hamlet on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> River Rea. It is commonly believed that the name 'Birmingham' comes from "Beorma inga ham", meaning farmstead of the sons (or descendants) of <!--del_lnk--> Beorma. Birmingham was first recorded in written documents by the <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> of 1086 as a small <!--del_lnk--> village, worth only 20 <!--del_lnk--> shillings. There were many variations on this name. Bermingeham is another version.</p>

        </div>

       <p>In 1166 the holder of the manor of Birmingham, <!--del_lnk--> Peter de Birmingham, was granted a royal charter to hold a <a href="../../wp/m/Market.htm" title="Market">market</a> in his castle, which in time became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Bull Ring, transforming Birmingham from a village to a market town. The de Birmingham family continued to be Lords of Birmingham until the 1530s when <!--del_lnk--> Edward de Birmingham was cheated out of its lordship by <!--del_lnk--> John Dudley.</p>
       <p>As early as the 16th century, Birmingham's access to supplies of <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> ore and <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> meant that <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metalworking</a> industries became established. By the time of the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Civil_War.htm" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> in the 17th century, Birmingham had become an important manufacturing town with a reputation for producing <!--del_lnk--> small arms. Arms manufacture in Birmingham became a staple trade and was concentrated in the area known as the <!--del_lnk--> Gun Quarter. During the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> (from the mid-18th century onwards), Birmingham grew rapidly into a major industrial centre and the town prospered. Birmingham&rsquo;s population grew from 15,000 in the late 17th century to 70,000 a century later. During the 18th century, Birmingham was home to the <!--del_lnk--> Lunar Society, an important gathering of local thinkers and industrialists.</p>
       <p>Birmingham rose to national political prominence in the campaign for political reform in the early nineteenth century, with <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Attwood's <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Political Union bringing the country to the brink of civil war and back during the <!--del_lnk--> Days of May that preceded the passing of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Reform Act in 1832. The Union's meetings on <!--del_lnk--> Newhall Hill in 1831 and 1832 were the largest political assemblies Britain had ever seen. <!--del_lnk--> Lord Durham, who drafted the act, wrote that "the country owed Reform to Birmingham, and its salvation from revolution".</p>
       <p>By the 1820s, an extensive <!--del_lnk--> canal system had been constructed, giving greater access to natural resources to fuel to industries. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Railways">Railways</a> arrived in Birmingham in 1837 with the arrival of the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Junction Railway, and a year later, the <!--del_lnk--> London and Birmingham Railway. During the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era, the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England. Birmingham was granted <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city status</a> in 1889 by <a href="../../wp/q/Queen_Victoria.htm" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Chamberlain, who was once mayor of Birmingham and later became an MP, and his son <!--del_lnk--> Neville Chamberlain, who was lord mayor Birmingham and later the British Prime Minister, are two of the most well-known political figures who have lived in Birmingham. The city established <!--del_lnk--> its own university in 1900.</p>

       <p>Birmingham suffered heavy <!--del_lnk--> bomb damage during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>'s "<!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Blitz", and the city was extensively redeveloped during the 1950s and 1960s. This included the construction of large tower block estates, such as <!--del_lnk--> Castle Vale. The <!--del_lnk--> Bull Ring reconstructed and <!--del_lnk--> New Street station was redeveloped. In recent years, Birmingham has been transformed, with the construction of new squares like Centenary Square and Millennium Place. Old streets, buildings and canals have been restored, the pedestrian subways have been removed, and the <!--del_lnk--> Bull Ring shopping centre has been completely redeveloped. These were the first steps in the ambitious plans of <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham City Council for the <!--del_lnk--> redevelopment of Birmingham, which has become known as the <!--del_lnk--> Big City Plan.</p>
       <p>In the decades following the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, the ethnic makeup of Birmingham changed significantly, as it received waves of immigration from the <a href="../../wp/c/Commonwealth_of_Nations.htm" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> and beyond. The city's population peaked in 1951 at 1,113,000 residents.</p>

No single party is in overall control and the council is run by a <a href="../../wp/c/Conservative_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a>/<a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrat</a> coalition led by <!--del_lnk--> Mike Whitby.</p>
       <p>The city is also the seat of regional government for the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands <!--del_lnk--> region of England as the home of the region's <!--del_lnk--> Government Office, the <!--del_lnk--> regional development agency <!--del_lnk--> Advantage West Midlands, and the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands Regional Assembly.</p>
       <p>Birmingham's ten <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary constituencies are represented in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> by one <a href="../../wp/c/Conservative_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a>, one <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats (UK)">Liberal Democrat</a> and eight <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Labour_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="British Labour Party">Labour</a> <!--del_lnk--> MPs. In the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Parliament.htm" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> the city forms part of the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands <!--del_lnk--> European Parliament constituency, which elects six <!--del_lnk--> Members of the European Parliament.</p>
       <p>Birmingham was originally part of <!--del_lnk--> Warwickshire, but expanded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, absorbing parts of <!--del_lnk--> Worcestershire to the south and <!--del_lnk--> Staffordshire to the north and west. The city absorbed <!--del_lnk--> Sutton Coldfield in 1974 and became a metropolitan borough in the new <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands county. Up until 1986, the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands County Council was based in <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham City Centre.</p>
       <p>Law enforcement in Birmingham is carried out by <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands Police, whose headquarters are at Lloyd House in Birmingham City Centre. With 87.92 recorded offences per 1000 population in 2009-10, Birmingham's crime rate is above the average for <!--del_lnk--> England and Wales, but lower than any of England's other major <!--del_lnk--> core cities, and lower than many smaller cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Reading, <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> or <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>.

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geography">Geography</span></h2>
       <p>Birmingham is located in the centre of the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands region of England on the <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Plateau &ndash; an area of relatively high ground, ranging around 500 to 1,000 feet (150&ndash;300 m) <!--del_lnk--> above sea level and crossed by Britain's main north-south <!--del_lnk--> watershed between the basins of the Rivers <a href="../../wp/r/River_Severn.htm" title="River Severn">Severn</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Trent. To the south west of the city lie the <!--del_lnk--> Lickey Hills, <!--del_lnk--> Clent Hills and <!--del_lnk--> Walton Hill, which reach 1,033 feet (315&nbsp;m) and have extensive views over the city.</p>
       <p>The City of Birmingham forms a <!--del_lnk--> conurbation with the largely residential borough of <!--del_lnk--> Solihull to the south east, and with the city of <!--del_lnk--> Wolverhampton and the industrial towns of the <!--del_lnk--> Black Country to the north west. Together these make up the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands Urban Area, which covers 59,972&nbsp;ha (600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>; 232&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and has a population of 2,284,093 (2001 Census). Beyond the urban area, Birmingham's <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area &ndash; the surrounding area to which it is closely economically tied through <!--del_lnk--> commuting &ndash; has a population of 3,683,000 (2001 Census) and includes the former <a href="../../wp/m/Mercia.htm" title="Mercia">Mercian</a> capital of <!--del_lnk--> Tamworth and the cathedral city of <!--del_lnk--> Lichfield in <!--del_lnk--> Staffordshire to the north; the industrial city of <a href="../../wp/c/Coventry.htm" title="Coventry">Coventry</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Warwickshire towns of <!--del_lnk--> Nuneaton, <!--del_lnk--> Warwick and <!--del_lnk--> Leamington Spa to the east; and the <!--del_lnk--> Worcestershire towns of <!--del_lnk--> Redditch and <!--del_lnk--> Bromsgrove to the south west.</p>
       <p>Much of the area now occupied by the city was originally a northern reach of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Forest of Arden, whose former presence can still be felt in the city's dense <a href="../../wp/o/Oak.htm" title="Oak">oak</a> tree-cover and in the large number of districts such as <!--del_lnk--> Moseley, <!--del_lnk--> Saltley, <!--del_lnk--> Yardley, <!--del_lnk--> Stirchley and <!--del_lnk--> Hockley with names ending in "-ley": the <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English.htm" title="Old English">Old English</a> <i>-l&#x113;ah</i> meaning "woodland clearing".</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Geology">Geology</span></h3>
       <p>Geologically, Birmingham is dominated by the <i>Birmingham Fault</i> which runs diagonally through the city from the Lickey Hills in the south west, passing through <!--del_lnk--> Edgbaston, the <!--del_lnk--> Bull Ring to <!--del_lnk--> Erdington and <!--del_lnk--> Sutton Coldfield in the north east. To the south and east of the fault the ground is largely softer Mercia Mudstone Group (formerly known as <!--del_lnk--> Keuper <!--del_lnk--> Marl), interspersed with beds of <!--del_lnk--> Bunter pebbles and crossed by the valleys of the Rivers <!--del_lnk--> Tame, <!--del_lnk--> Rea and <!--del_lnk--> Cole along with their tributaries. Much of this would have been laid down during the <a href="../../wp/p/Permian.htm" title="Permian">Permian</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Triassic.htm" title="Triassic">Triassic</a> periods. To the north and west of the fault, varying from 150 to 600 feet (45&ndash;180 m) higher than the surrounding area and underlying much of the city centre, lies a long ridge of harder <!--del_lnk--> Keuper <!--del_lnk--> Sandstone.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
       <p>The climate in Birmingham is classified as a <!--del_lnk--> temperate <a href="../../wp/o/Oceanic_climate.htm" title="Oceanic climate">maritime climate</a>, like much of the British Isles, with average maximum <a href="../../wp/t/Temperature.htm" title="Temperature">temperatures</a> in summer (July) being around <span style="white-space:nowrap;">20 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(68&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>; and in winter (January) is around <span style="white-space:nowrap;">4.5 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(40.1&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>. Extreme weather is rare but the city has been known to experience <a href="../../wp/t/Tornado.htm" title="Tornado">tornados</a> &ndash; the most recent being in <!--del_lnk--> July 2005 in the south of the city, damaging homes and businesses in the area.</p>
       <p>Occasional summer heatwaves, such as the one experienced in July 2006 have become more common in recent years, and winters had become milder until since the 1990s with snow becoming much less frequent, although this seems to have been reversed in the last couple of years with the winter of 2009-10 being the coldest for some 30 years. Similar to most other large cities, Birmingham has a considerable '<!--del_lnk--> urban heat island' effect. During the coldest night recorded in Birmingham (14 January 1982), for example, the temperature fell to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;20.8 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(&minus;5.4&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> at <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Airport on the city's eastern edge, but just <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;12.9 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(8.8&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> at Edgbaston, near the city centre. Relative to other large UK conurbations, Birmingham is a snowy city, due to its inland location and comparatively high elevation. Snow showers often pass through the city via the <!--del_lnk--> Cheshire gap on North Westerly airstreams, but can also come off the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> from North Easterly airstreams.</p>

       <p>With a city <a href="../../wp/g/Gross_domestic_product.htm" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a> of $90bn (2008 est., <!--del_lnk--> PPP), Birmingham has the second-largest urban economy in the United Kingdom and the 72nd-largest in the world. Although the city grew to prominence as a <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a> centre, its economy today is dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> service sector, which in 2008 accounted for 86% of its employment. Birmingham is the largest centre for employment in <!--del_lnk--> public administration, <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a> and <!--del_lnk--> health in Great Britain, and after <a href="../../wp/l/Leeds.htm" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> it is the third-largest centre for employment in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bank.htm" title="Banking">banking</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Finance.htm" title="Finance">finance</a> and <!--del_lnk--> insurance outside <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. It is ranked as a <!--del_lnk--> gamma- world city by the <!--del_lnk--> Globalization and World Cities Research Network.</p>
       <p>Two of Britain's largest banks were founded in Birmingham &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Lloyds Bank (now <!--del_lnk--> Lloyds Banking Group) in 1765 and the <!--del_lnk--> Midland Bank (now <!--del_lnk--> HSBC Bank) in 1836 &ndash; as well as <!--del_lnk--> Ketley's Building Society, the world's first <!--del_lnk--> building society, in 1775. In 2010, <!--del_lnk--> Cushman &amp; Wakefield stated that Birmingham was the third best place in the United Kingdom to locate a business, and the 18th best in Europe.</p>
       <p>Tourism is also an increasingly important part of the local economy. With major facilities such as the <!--del_lnk--> International Convention Centre and <!--del_lnk--> National Exhibition Centre the Birmingham area accounts for 42% of the UK conference and exhibition trade. The city's sporting and cultural venues attract large numbers of visitors.</p>
       <p>The city's three Universities, (<!--del_lnk--> Aston University, <!--del_lnk--> University of Birmingham and <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham City University) and two University colleges have over 65,000 students and employ around 15,000 staff, making a significant contribution to the city's economy as well as its research and innovation base.</p>

       <p>With an annual turnover of &pound;2.43bn, Birmingham city centre is the UK's third largest retail centre, with the country's busiest <!--del_lnk--> shopping centre &ndash; the <!--del_lnk--> Bullring &ndash; and the largest <!--del_lnk--> department store outside London &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> House of Fraser on <!--del_lnk--> Corporation Street. The City also has one of only four <!--del_lnk--> Selfridges department stores, and the second largest branch of <!--del_lnk--> Debenhams in the country.

       <p>Manufacturing accounts for 10% of employment in Birmingham, a figure below the average for Great Britain as a whole. Despite the decline of manufacturing in the city several significant industrial plants remain, including <a href="../../wp/j/Jaguar_Cars.htm" title="Jaguar Cars">Jaguar Cars</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Castle Bromwich and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cadbury.htm" title="Cadbury Trebor Bassett">Cadbury Trebor Bassett</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Bournville.</p>
       <p>Although the city has seen economic growth greater than the national average in the 21st century the benefits have been uneven, with <!--del_lnk--> commuters from the surrounding area obtaining many of the more skilled jobs. The two parliamentary constituencies with the highest unemployment rates in the UK &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Ladywood and <!--del_lnk--> Sparkbrook and Small Heath &ndash; are both in inner-city Birmingham. Growth has also added to stresses on the city's transport. Many major roads and the central <!--del_lnk--> New Street railway station operate over capacity at peak times.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Birmingham is chiefly a product of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries; its growth began during the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. Consequently, relatively few buildings survive from its earlier history, and those that do are protected. There are 1,946 <!--del_lnk--> listed buildings in <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham and thirteen <!--del_lnk--> scheduled ancient monuments. Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings that do not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.</p>
       <p>Traces of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Medieval">medieval</a> Birmingham can be seen in the oldest churches, notably the original <!--del_lnk--> parish church, <!--del_lnk--> St Martin in the Bull Ring. A few other buildings from the medieval and <!--del_lnk--> Tudor periods survive, among them the <i><!--del_lnk--> Lad in the Lane</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>The Old Crown</i>, the 15th century <i><!--del_lnk--> Saracen's Head</i> public house and Old Grammar School in <!--del_lnk--> Kings Norton and <!--del_lnk--> Blakesley Hall.</p>
       <p>A number of <!--del_lnk--> Georgian buildings survive, including <!--del_lnk--> St Philip's Cathedral, <!--del_lnk--> Soho House, <!--del_lnk--> Perrott's Folly, the <!--del_lnk--> Town Hall and much of <!--del_lnk--> St Paul's Square. The <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era saw extensive building across the city. Major civic buildings such as the <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Law Courts (in characteristic <!--del_lnk--> red brick and terracotta), the <!--del_lnk--> Council House and the <!--del_lnk--> Museum &amp; Art Gallery were constructed. <!--del_lnk--> St Chad's Cathedral was the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> cathedral to be built in the UK since the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Reformation.htm" title="English Reformation">Reformation</a>. Across the city, the need to house the industrial workers gave rise to miles of redbrick streets and terraces, many of <!--del_lnk--> back-to-back houses, some of which were later to become inner-city <!--del_lnk--> slums.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Postwar redevelopment and anti-Victorianism resulted in the loss of dozens Victorian buildings like <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham New Street Station, and the old Central Library. In inner-city areas too, much Victorian housing was <!--del_lnk--> redeveloped. Existing communities were relocated to <!--del_lnk--> tower block <!--del_lnk--> estates like <!--del_lnk--> Castle Vale.</p>
       <p>Birmingham City Council now has an extensive tower block demolition and renovation programme. There has been a lot of construction in the city centre in recent years, including the award-winning <!--del_lnk--> Future Systems' <!--del_lnk--> Selfridges building in the <!--del_lnk--> Bullring Shopping Centre, the <!--del_lnk--> Brindleyplace regeneration project and the <!--del_lnk--> Millennium Point science and technology centre. Funding for many of these projects has come from the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>; the Town Hall for example received &pound;3 million in funding from the <!--del_lnk--> European Regional Development Fund.</p>
       <p>Highrise development has slowed since the 1970s and mainly in recent years due to enforcements imposed by the <!--del_lnk--> Civil Aviation Authority on the heights of buildings as they could affect aircraft from the Airport (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Beetham Tower).</p>

       <p>Partly because of its inland central location, Birmingham is a major transport hub on the <!--del_lnk--> motorway, <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">rail</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canal</a> networks. The city is served by a number of major motorways and probably the best known motorway junction in the UK: <!--del_lnk--> Spaghetti Junction.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> National Express UK headquarters are located on Birmingham's <!--del_lnk--> Eastside, alongside the newly developed <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Coach Station, which forms the national hub of the company's coach network.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Airport, located six miles east of the city centre in the neighbouring borough of <!--del_lnk--> Solihull, is the <!--del_lnk--> sixth busiest by passenger traffic in the United Kingdom, and the second busiest outside the <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> area. It is a major base for airlines including <!--del_lnk--> Flybe, <a href="../../wp/r/Ryanair.htm" title="Ryanair">Ryanair</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Bmibaby, <!--del_lnk--> Monarch Airlines and <!--del_lnk--> Thomson Airways; and is connected by <!--del_lnk--> flag carrier airlines to major international <!--del_lnk--> hubs including <!--del_lnk--> Dubai, <!--del_lnk--> New York-Newark, <!--del_lnk--> Frankfurt, <!--del_lnk--> Paris-Charles de Gaulle and <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam.</p>

       <p>Local public transport is by <!--del_lnk--> bus, local train and <a href="../../wp/t/Tram.htm" title="Tram">tram</a>. Bus routes are mainly operated by <!--del_lnk--> National Express West Midlands, which accounts for over 80% of all bus journeys in Birmingham, however, there are around 50 other, smaller registered bus companies. The <!--del_lnk--> number 11 outer circle bus routes are the longest urban bus routes in Europe, being 26 miles (42&nbsp;km) long with 272 bus stops.</p>
       <p>The city's main railway station, <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham New Street, is at the centre of the national railway network. <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Snow Hill station, another <!--del_lnk--> major railway station in the city centre, is also the terminus for the <!--del_lnk--> Midland Metro which operates between the station and <!--del_lnk--> Wolverhampton, also serving the nearby towns of <!--del_lnk--> Bilston, <!--del_lnk--> Wednesbury and <!--del_lnk--> West Bromwich. There are plans to extend the Midland Metro route further into Birmingham city centre. Birmingham has a large rail-based park and ride network that feeds the city centre.</p>
       <p>Birmingham is also notable for its extensive <!--del_lnk--> canal system, and the city is often noted for having more miles of canal than <!--del_lnk--> Venice. The canals fed the industry in the city during the Industrial Revolution. Canalside regeneration schemes such as <!--del_lnk--> Brindleyplace have turned the canals into tourist attractions.</p>

It also runs the <a href="../../wp/l/Library.htm" title="Library">library</a> service, with 4 million visitors annually, and provides around 3,500 <!--del_lnk--> adult education courses throughout the year. The main library is <!--del_lnk--> Central Library and there are 41 local libraries in Birmingham, plus a regular mobile library service.</p>
       <p>Most of Birmingham's <!--del_lnk--> state schools are <!--del_lnk--> community schools run directly by <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham City Council in its role as <!--del_lnk--> local education authority (LEA). However, there are a large number of <!--del_lnk--> voluntary aided schools within the state system. <!--del_lnk--> King Edward's School is perhaps the most prestigious <!--del_lnk--> independent school in the city. The seven schools of The King Edward VI Foundation are known nationally for setting very high academic standards and all the schools consistently achieve top positions in national league tables.</p>

The <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Conservatoire and <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham School of Acting, both now part of Birmingham City University, offer higher education in specific arts subjects. The range of Universities and colleges means that there are over 65,000 higher education students in Birmingham, making it the UK's second largest student city to London. The <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower is a campanile located in Chancellor's court at the University of Birmingham. It is the tallest free-standing clock tower in the world.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Metropolitan College is one of the largest further education colleges in the country, formed through a series of mergers between smaller colleges. Joseph Chamberlain College is the only <!--del_lnk--> sixth form college in Birmingham and Solihull to have been awarded both <!--del_lnk--> Beacon Status and an overall <!--del_lnk--> OFSTED grade 1 (Outstanding).</p>
       <p>Since the 1970s, most secondary schools in Birmingham have been 11-16/18 comprehensive schools, while post <!--del_lnk--> GCSE students have the choice of continuing their education in either a school's sixth form or at a further education college. Birmingham has always operated a primary school system of 5&ndash;7 infant and 7&ndash;11 junior schools.</p>

A short distance from <!--del_lnk--> Five Ways the <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Oratory was completed in 1910 on the site of <!--del_lnk--> Cardinal Newman's original foundation.</p>
       <p>The oldest surviving synagogue in Birmingham is the 1825 <!--del_lnk--> Greek Revival <!--del_lnk--> Severn Street Synagogue, now a <!--del_lnk--> Freemason's Lodge hall.

The <!--del_lnk--> Football League &ndash; the world's first league <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Association_football.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> competition &ndash; was founded by Birmingham resident and <!--del_lnk--> Aston Villa director <!--del_lnk--> William McGregor, who wrote to fellow club directors in 1888 proposing "that ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England combine to arrange home-and-away fixtures each season". The modern game of <a href="../../wp/t/Tennis.htm" title="Tennis">tennis</a> was developed between 1859 and 1865 by <!--del_lnk--> Harry Gem and his friend <!--del_lnk--> Augurio Perera at Perera's house in <!--del_lnk--> Edgbaston, with the <!--del_lnk--> Edgbaston Archery and Lawn Tennis Society remaining the oldest tennis club in the world. The <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham and District Cricket League is the oldest cricket league in the world, and Birmingham was the host for the first ever Cricket World Cup, a <!--del_lnk--> Women's Cricket World Cup in 1973. Birmingham was the first city to be named National City of Sport by the <!--del_lnk--> Sports Council.
