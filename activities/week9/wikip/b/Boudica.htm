AD 60 or 61) was queen of the <!--del_lnk--> British <!--del_lnk--> Iceni tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>.</p>
       <p>Boudica's husband <!--del_lnk--> Prasutagus, ruler of the Iceni tribe, who had ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome, left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Emperor in his will; however, when he died, his will was ignored&nbsp;&mdash;the kingdom was <!--del_lnk--> annexed as if conquered, Boudica was <!--del_lnk--> flogged, her daughters were raped, and Roman financiers called in their loans.</p>
       <p>In AD 60 or 61, while the <!--del_lnk--> Roman governor, <!--del_lnk--> Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was leading a campaign on the <!--del_lnk--> island of Anglesey off the northwest coast of <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>&mdash;Boudica led the Iceni people in revolt, along with the <!--del_lnk--> Trinovantes and others. They destroyed <!--del_lnk--> Camulodunum (modern <!--del_lnk--> Colchester), earlier the capital of the Trinovantes, but then a <i><!--del_lnk--> colonia</i> (a settlement for discharged Roman soldiers) and the site of a temple to the former Emperor <a href="../../wp/c/Claudius.htm" title="Claudius">Claudius</a>, which was built and maintained at local expense. They also routed a <!--del_lnk--> Roman legion, the <!--del_lnk--> IX <i>Hispana</i>, sent to relieve the settlement.</p>
       <p>On hearing the news of the revolt, Suetonius hurried to <!--del_lnk--> Londinium (London), the twenty-year-old commercial settlement that was the rebels' next target. Concluding that he did not have the numbers to defend the settlement, Suetonius evacuated and abandoned it&mdash;Londinium was burnt to the ground, as was <!--del_lnk--> Verulamium (<!--del_lnk--> St Albans). An estimated 70,000&ndash;80,000 people were killed in the three cities (though the figures are suspect). Suetonius, meanwhile, regrouped his forces in the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands and, despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated the Britons in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Watling Street. The crisis caused the Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Nero to consider withdrawing all Roman forces from Britain, but Suetonius' eventual victory over Boudica re-secured Roman control of the province. Boudica then either killed herself, so she would not be captured, or fell ill and died&mdash;the extant sources, <!--del_lnk--> Tacitus and <!--del_lnk--> Cassius Dio, differ.</p>
       <p>Interest in the history of these events was revived during the <!--del_lnk--> English Renaissance and led to a resurgence of Boudica's legendary fame during the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era, when <a href="../../wp/q/Queen_Victoria.htm" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> was portrayed as her '<!--del_lnk--> namesake'. Boudica has since remained an important <!--del_lnk--> cultural symbol in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The absence of native British literature during the early part of the first millennium means that Britain owes its knowledge of Boudica's rebellion solely to the writings of the Romans.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Boudica.27s_name">Boudica's name</span></h3>
       <p>Boudica has been known by several versions of her name. <!--del_lnk--> Raphael Holinshed calls her Voadicia, while <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Spenser calls her <b>Bunduca</b>, a version of the name that was used in the popular Jacobean play <i><!--del_lnk--> Bonduca</i>, in 1612. <!--del_lnk--> William Cowper's poem, <i>Boadicea, an ode</i> (1782) popularised an alternate version of the name. From the 19th century and much of the late 20th century, <i>Boadicea</i> was the most common version of the name, which is probably derived from a mistranscription when a manuscript of <!--del_lnk--> Tacitus was copied in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Her name was clearly spelled <b>Boudicca</b> in the best manuscripts of Tacitus, but also <i>&Beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&delta;&omicron;&upsilon;&iota;&kappa;&alpha;</i>, <i>&Beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu;&delta;&omicron;&upsilon;&iota;&kappa;&alpha;</i>, and <i>&Beta;&omicron;&delta;&omicron;&upsilon;&iota;&kappa;&alpha;</i> in the (later and probably secondary) <!--del_lnk--> epitome of Cassius Dio. The name is attested in inscriptions as "Boudica" in <!--del_lnk--> Lusitania, <b>Boudiga</b> in <!--del_lnk--> Bordeaux, and <b>Bodicca</b> in Algeria. <!--del_lnk--> Kenneth Jackson concludes, based on later development of Welsh and Irish, that it derives from the <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Celtic feminine adjective <i>*boud&#x12B;ka</i>, "victorious", derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic word <i>*bouda</i>, "victory" (cf. <!--del_lnk--> Irish <i>bua</i> (Classical Irish <i>buadh</i>), <i>Buaidheach</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Welsh <i>buddugoliaeth</i>), and that the correct spelling of the name in the <!--del_lnk--> British language is <i>Boudica</i>, pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> [b&#x252;&#x28A;&#x2C8;di&#x2D0;ka&#x2D0;]</span> (the closest English equivalent to the vowel in the first syllable is the <i>ow</i> in "bow-and-arrow"). The modern English pronunciation is <span class="nowrap"><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> /</span><span class="IPA"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="border-bottom:1px dotted" title="/&#x2C8;/ primary stress follows">&#x2C8;</span></span><span class="IPA"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="border-bottom:1px dotted" title="'b' in 'buy'">b</span></span><span class="IPA"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="border-bottom:1px dotted" title="/u&#x2D0;/ long 'oo' in 'food'">u&#x2D0;</span></span><span class="IPA"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="border-bottom:1px dotted" title="'d' in 'dye'">d</span></span><span class="IPA"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="border-bottom:1px dotted" title="/&#x26A;/ short 'i' in 'bid'">&#x26A;</span></span><span class="IPA"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="border-bottom:1px dotted" title="'k' in 'kind'">k</span></span><span class="IPA"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="border-bottom:1px dotted" title="/&#x259;/ 'a' in 'about'">&#x259;</span></span><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> /</span></span>. It is suggested that the most comparable English name, in meaning only, would be "Victoria".</p>

       </div>
       <p>Tacitus and Dio agree that Boudica was of <!--del_lnk--> royal descent. Dio says that she was "possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women", that she was tall, had hair described as reddish-brown or tawny hanging below her waist, a harsh voice and a piercing glare, and habitually wore a large golden necklace (perhaps a <!--del_lnk--> torc), a many-coloured tunic, and a thick cloak fastened by a <!--del_lnk--> brooch.</p>
       <p>Her husband, <!--del_lnk--> Prasutagus, was the king of <!--del_lnk--> Iceni, people who inhabited roughly what is now <a href="../../wp/n/Norfolk.htm" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>. They initially were not part of the territory under direct Roman control, having voluntarily allied themselves to Rome following <a href="../../wp/c/Claudius.htm" title="Claudius">Claudius</a>' <!--del_lnk--> conquest of AD 43. They were proud of their independence and had revolted in AD 47 when the then-governor <!--del_lnk--> Publius Ostorius Scapula threatened to disarm them. Prasutagus had lived a long life of conspicuous wealth and, hoping to preserve his line, made the <!--del_lnk--> Roman emperor co-heir to his kingdom, along with his wife and two daughters. It was normal Roman practice to allow allied kingdoms their independence only for the lifetime of their <!--del_lnk--> client king, who would agree to leave his kingdom to Rome in his will&nbsp;&mdash; the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Bithynia and <!--del_lnk--> Galatia, for example, were incorporated into the Empire in just this way. <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_law.htm" title="Roman law">Roman law</a> also allowed <!--del_lnk--> inheritance only through the male line, so when Prasutagus died his attempts to preserve his line were ignored and his kingdom was annexed as if it had been conquered; lands and property were confiscated and nobles treated like slaves. According to <!--del_lnk--> Tacitus, Boudica was flogged and her daughters were raped. Cassius Dio says that Roman financiers, including <!--del_lnk--> Seneca the Younger, chose this time to call in their loans. Tacitus does not mention this, but does single out the <!--del_lnk--> procurator, <!--del_lnk--> Catus Decianus, for criticism for his "avarice". Prasutagus, it seems, had lived well on borrowed Roman money, and on his death his subjects had become liable for the debt.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Boudica.27s_uprising">Boudica's uprising</span></h3>
       <p>In AD 60 or 61, while the current governor, <!--del_lnk--> Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was leading a campaign against the island of Mona (modern <!--del_lnk--> Anglesey) in the north of Wales, which was a refuge for British rebels and a stronghold of the <!--del_lnk--> druids, the Iceni conspired with their neighbours the Trinovantes, amongst others, to revolt. Boudica was chosen as their leader. According to Tacitus, they drew inspiration from the example of <!--del_lnk--> Arminius, the prince of the <!--del_lnk--> Cherusci who had driven the Romans out of Germany in AD 9, and their own ancestors who had driven <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> from Britain. Dio says that at the outset Boudica employed a form of <!--del_lnk--> divination, releasing a <!--del_lnk--> hare from the folds of her dress and interpreting the direction in which it ran, and invoked <!--del_lnk--> Andraste, a British <!--del_lnk--> goddess of <!--del_lnk--> victory.</p>
       <p>The rebels' first target was <!--del_lnk--> Camulodunum (<!--del_lnk--> Colchester), the former Trinovantian capital and, at that time, a Roman <i><!--del_lnk--> colonia</i>. The Roman veterans who had been settled there mistreated the locals and a temple to the former emperor <a href="../../wp/c/Claudius.htm" title="Claudius">Claudius</a> had been erected there at local expense, making the city a focus for resentment. The Roman inhabitants sought reinforcements from the procurator, Catus Decianus, but he sent only two hundred <!--del_lnk--> auxiliary troops. Boudica's army fell on the poorly defended city and destroyed it, besieging the last defenders in the temple for two days before it fell. <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">Archaeologists</a> have shown that the city was methodically demolished. The future governor <!--del_lnk--> Quintus Petillius Cerialis, then commanding the <!--del_lnk--> Legio IX <i>Hispana</i>, attempted to relieve the city, but suffered an <!--del_lnk--> overwhelming defeat. His infantry was wiped out&nbsp;&mdash; only the commander and some of his cavalry escaped. The location of this famous destruction of the Legio IX is now claimed by some to be the village of <!--del_lnk--> Great Wratting, in Suffolk, which lies in the Stour Valley on the Icknield Way West of Colchester, and by a village in Essex. After this defeat, Catus Decianus fled to <!--del_lnk--> Gaul.</p>
       <p>When news of the rebellion reached him, Suetonius hurried along <a href="../../wp/w/Watling_Street.htm" title="Watling Street">Watling Street</a> through hostile territory to Londinium. Londinium was a relatively new settlement, founded after the conquest of 43 AD, but it had grown to be a thriving commercial centre with a population of travellers, traders, and, probably, Roman officials. Suetonius considered giving battle there, but considering his lack of numbers and chastened by Petillius's defeat, decided to sacrifice the city to save the province.</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>...Alarmed by this disaster and by the fury of the province which he had goaded into war by his rapacity, the procurator Catus crossed over into Gaul. Suetonius, however, with wonderful resolution, marched amidst a hostile population to Londinium, which, though undistinguished by the name of a colony, was much frequented by a number of merchants and trading vessels. Uncertain whether he should choose it as a seat of war, as he looked round on his scanty force of soldiers, and remembered with what a serious warning the rashness of Petilius had been punished, he resolved to save the province at the cost of a single town. Nor did the tears and weeping of the people, as they implored his aid, deter him from giving the signal of departure and receiving into his army all who would go with him. Those who were chained to the spot by the weakness of their sex, or the infirmity of age, or the attractions of the place, were cut off by the enemy. <small>- Tacitus</small></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Londinium was abandoned to the rebels who burnt it down, slaughtering anyone who had not evacuated with Suetonius. Archaeology shows a thick red layer of burnt debris covering coins and pottery dating before 60&#x202F;AD within the bounds of Roman Londinium. <!--del_lnk--> Verulamium (<!--del_lnk--> St Albans) was next to be destroyed.</p>
       <p>In the three settlements destroyed, between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed. Tacitus says that the Britons had no interest in taking or selling prisoners, only in slaughter by <!--del_lnk--> gibbet, fire, or cross. Dio's account gives more detail; that the noblest women were impaled on spikes and had their breasts cut off and sewn to their mouths, "to the accompaniment of sacrifices, banquets, and wanton behaviour" in sacred places, particularly the groves of Andraste.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>While Boudica's army continued their assault in Verulamium (St. Albans), Suetonius regrouped his forces. According to Tacitus, he amassed a force including his own <!--del_lnk--> Legio XIV <i>Gemina</i>, some <i>vexillationes</i> (detachments) of the <!--del_lnk--> XX <i>Valeria Victrix</i>, and any available auxiliaries. The <!--del_lnk--> prefect of <!--del_lnk--> Legio II <i>Augusta</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Poenius Postumus, stationed near <!--del_lnk--> Exeter, ignored the call, and a fourth legion, <!--del_lnk--> IX <i>Hispana</i>, had been routed trying to relieve Camulodunum, but nonetheless the governor was able to call on almost ten thousand men.</p>
       <p>Suetonius took a stand at an unidentified location, probably in the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands somewhere along the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Roman_roads.htm" title="Roman road">Roman road</a> now known as <a href="../../wp/w/Watling_Street.htm" title="Watling Street">Watling Street</a>, in a <!--del_lnk--> defile with a wood behind him&nbsp;&mdash; but his men were heavily outnumbered. Dio says that, even if they were lined up one deep, they would not have extended the length of Boudica's line. By now the rebel forces were said to have numbered 230,000, however, this number should be treated with scepticism&nbsp;&mdash; Dio's account is known only from a late <!--del_lnk--> epitome, and ancient sources commonly exaggerate enemy numbers.</p>
       <p>Boudica exhorted her troops from her <!--del_lnk--> chariot, her daughters beside her. Tacitus gives her a short speech in which she presents herself not as an <!--del_lnk--> aristocrat avenging her lost wealth, but as an ordinary person, avenging her lost freedom, her battered body, and the abused chastity of her daughters. She said their cause was just, and the deities were on their side; the one legion that had dared to face them had been destroyed. She, a woman, was resolved to win or die; if the men wanted to live in slavery, that was their choice.</p>
       <p>However, the lack of manoeuvrability of the British forces, combined with lack of open-field tactics to command these numbers, put them at a disadvantage to the Romans, who were skilled at open combat due to their superior equipment and discipline. Also, the narrowness of the field meant that Boudica could put forth only as many troops as the Romans could at a given time.</p>
       <p>First, the Romans stood their ground and used volleys of <i><!--del_lnk--> pila</i> (heavy javelins) to kill thousands of Britons who were rushing toward the Roman lines. The Roman soldiers, who had now used up their <i>pila</i>, were then able to engage Boudica's second wave in the open. As the Romans advanced in a <!--del_lnk--> wedge formation, the Britons attempted to flee, but were impeded by the presence of their own families, whom they had stationed in a ring of wagons at the edge of the battlefield, and were slaughtered. This is not the first instance of this tactic&nbsp;&mdash; the women of the <!--del_lnk--> Cimbri, in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Vercellae against <!--del_lnk--> Gaius Marius, were stationed in a line of wagons and acted as a last line of defence. <!--del_lnk--> Ariovistus of the <!--del_lnk--> Suebi is reported to have done the same thing in his battle against <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>. Tacitus reports that "according to one report almost eighty thousand Britons fell" compared with only four hundred Romans.</p>
       <p>According to Tacitus in his <i>Annals</i>, Boudica poisoned herself, though in the <i>Agricola</i> which was written almost twenty years prior he mentions nothing of suicide and attributes the end of the revolt to <i>socordia</i> ("indolence"); Dio says she fell sick and died and then was given a lavish burial; though this may be a convenient way to remove her from the story. Considering Dio must have read Tacitus, it is worth noting he mentions nothing about suicide (which was also how Postumus and Nero ended their lives).</p>
       <p>Postumus, on hearing of the Roman victory, fell on his sword. <!--del_lnk--> Catus Decianus, who had fled to Gaul, was replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Gaius Julius Alpinus Classicianus. Suetonius conducted punitive operations, but criticism by Classicianus led to an investigation headed by <!--del_lnk--> Nero's <!--del_lnk--> freedman <!--del_lnk--> Polyclitus. Fearing Suetonius' actions would provoke further rebellion, Nero replaced the governor with the more conciliatory <!--del_lnk--> Publius Petronius Turpilianus. The historian <!--del_lnk--> Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus tells us the crisis had almost persuaded Nero to abandon Britain.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Location_of_her_defeat">Location of her defeat</span></h3>
       <p>The location of Boudica's defeat is unknown. Most historians favour a site in the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands, somewhere along the Roman road now known as <a href="../../wp/w/Watling_Street.htm" title="Watling Street">Watling Street</a>. Kevin K. Carroll suggests a site close to <!--del_lnk--> High Cross in <!--del_lnk--> Leicestershire, on the junction of Watling Street and the <a href="../../wp/f/Fosse_Way.htm" title="Fosse Way">Fosse Way</a>, which would have allowed the <!--del_lnk--> Legio II <i>Augusta</i>, based at <!--del_lnk--> Exeter, to rendezvous with the rest of Suetonius's forces, had they not failed to do so. <!--del_lnk--> Manduessedum (<!--del_lnk--> Mancetter), near the modern town of <!--del_lnk--> Atherstone in <!--del_lnk--> Warwickshire, has also been suggested, as has 'The Rampart' near <!--del_lnk--> Messing in <!--del_lnk--> Essex, according to legend. More recently, a discovery of Roman artefacts in <!--del_lnk--> Kings Norton close to <!--del_lnk--> Metchley Camp has suggested another possibility, and a thorough examination of a stretch of Watling Street between St. Albans, Boudica's last known location, and the Fosse Way junction has suggested the Cuttle Mill area of <!--del_lnk--> Paulerspury in Northamptonshire, which has topography very closely matching that described by Tacitus of the scene of the battle. In March 2010 evidence was published suggesting the site may be located at <!--del_lnk--> Church Stowe, Northamptonshire.</p>

       <p>By the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> Boudica was forgotten. She makes no appearance in <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a>'s work, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Historia Brittonum</i>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mabinogion</i> or <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey of Monmouth's <i><!--del_lnk--> History of the Kings of Britain</i>. But the rediscovery of the works of Tacitus during the Renaissance allowed <!--del_lnk--> Polydore Vergil to reintroduce her into British history as "Voadicea" in 1534. Raphael Holinshed also included her story in his <i>Chronicles</i> (1577), based on Tacitus and Dio, and inspired <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare's</a> younger contemporaries <!--del_lnk--> Francis Beaumont and <!--del_lnk--> John Fletcher to write a play, <i><!--del_lnk--> Bonduca</i>, in 1610. <!--del_lnk--> William Cowper wrote a popular poem, "Boadicea, an ode," in 1782.</p>
       <p>It was in the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era that Boudica's fame took on legendary proportions as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Queen_Victoria.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> came to be seen as Boudica's "namesake", their names being identical in meaning. Victoria's <!--del_lnk--> Poet Laureate, <!--del_lnk--> Alfred, Lord Tennyson, wrote a poem, "Boadicea," and several ships were named <!--del_lnk--> after her. A great bronze statue of Boudica with her daughters in her war chariot (furnished with <!--del_lnk--> scythes after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/History_of_Iran.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> fashion) was commissioned by <!--del_lnk--> Prince Albert and executed by <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Thornycroft. It was completed in 1905 and stands next to <!--del_lnk--> Westminster Bridge and the <a href="../../wp/p/Palace_of_Westminster.htm" title="Palace of Westminster">Houses of Parliament</a>, with the following lines from Cowper's poem, referring to the British Empire:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <div class="poem">
         <p>Regions Caesar never knew<br /> Thy posterity shall sway.</p>
        </div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Ironically, the great anti-imperialist rebel was now identified with the head of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, and her statue stood guard over the city she razed to the ground.</p>
       <p>In more recent times, Boudica has been the subject of numerous documentaries, including some by <!--del_lnk--> Discovery Channel, <!--del_lnk--> History International Channel (now known as H2), and the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a>.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Boudica_and_King.27s_Cross">Boudica and King's Cross</span></h3>
       <p>The area of <!--del_lnk--> King's Cross, London was previously a village known as Battle Bridge which was an ancient crossing of the <!--del_lnk--> River Fleet. The original name of the bridge was Broad Ford Bridge.</p>
       <p>The name "Battle Bridge" led to a tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the Iceni tribe led by Boudica. The tradition is not supported by any historical evidence and is rejected by modern historians. However <!--del_lnk--> Lewis Spence's 1937 book <i>Boadicea - warrior queen of the Britons</i> went so far as to include a map showing the positions of the opposing armies. There is a belief that she was buried between platforms 9 and 10 in <!--del_lnk--> King's Cross station in London, England. There is no evidence for this and it is probably a post World War II invention.</p>
