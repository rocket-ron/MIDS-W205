It is the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Bethlehem Governorate of the <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian National Authority. The economy is primarily <!--del_lnk--> tourist-driven.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew Bible identifies Bethlehem as the city <!--del_lnk--> David was from. The <a href="../../wp/n/New_Testament.htm" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. The town is inhabited by one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, although the size of the community has shrunk due to emigration.</p>
       <p>The city was sacked by the <!--del_lnk--> Samaritans in 529, but rebuilt by the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> emperor <!--del_lnk--> Justinian I. Bethlehem was conquered by the <!--del_lnk--> Arab Caliphate of <!--del_lnk--> 'Umar ibn al-Khatt&#x101;b in 637, who guaranteed safety for the city's religious shrines. In 1099, Crusaders captured and fortified Bethlehem and replaced its <!--del_lnk--> Greek Orthodox clergy with a <a href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Catholic Church">Latin</a> one. The Latin clergy were expelled after the city was captured by <a href="../../wp/s/Saladin.htm" title="Saladin">Saladin</a>, the <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">sultan</a> of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>. With the coming of the <!--del_lnk--> Mamluks in 1250, the city's walls were demolished, and were subsequently rebuilt during the rule of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.</p>
       <p>The British wrested control of the city from the Ottomans during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and it was to be included in an <!--del_lnk--> international zone under the 1947 <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> annexed the city in the <!--del_lnk--> 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It was occupied by <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> in the 1967 <!--del_lnk--> Six-Day War. Since 1995, Bethlehem has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority.</p>
       <p>Bethlehem has a <!--del_lnk--> Muslim majority, but is also home to one of the largest <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian Christian communities. Bethlehem's chief <!--del_lnk--> economic sector is tourism which peaks during the <a href="../../wp/c/Christmas.htm" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> season when Christian pilgrims throng to the <!--del_lnk--> Church of the Nativity. Bethlehem has over thirty hotels and three hundred handicraft work shops. <!--del_lnk--> Rachel's Tomb, an important Jewish holy site, is located at the northern entrance of Bethlehem.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Canaanite_period">Canaanite period</span></h3>
       <p>A historical reference to the town appears in the <!--del_lnk--> Amarna Letters (c. 1400 BC) when the King of Jerusalem appeals to his overlord, the King of Egypt, for help in retaking "<i>Bit-Lahmi</i>" in the wake of disturbances by the <!--del_lnk--> Apiru. It is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that this was a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals.</p>
       <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Lachmo</i> was the <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian god of fertility. Worshiped by the <!--del_lnk--> Canaanites as <i><!--del_lnk--> Lachama</i>, some time in the 3rd millennium BC, they erected a temple to worship the god on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity. The town was known as <i>Beit Lachama</i>, meaning "House of Lachama." <!--del_lnk--> William F. Albright notes the pronunciation of the name remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, but has meant different things: "'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and <!--del_lnk--> Aramaic, 'House of Flesh' in Arabic."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Israelite_and_Judean_period">Israelite and Judean period</span></h3>
       <p>Archaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as an Israelite city was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the <!--del_lnk--> City of David in the form of a <i><!--del_lnk--> bulla</i> (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads "From the town of Bethlehem to the King," indicating that it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.</p>
       <p>Biblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the "hill country" of <!--del_lnk--> Judah, may be the same as the Biblical <!--del_lnk--> Ephrath, which means "fertile", as there is a reference to it in the <!--del_lnk--> Book of Micah as Bethlehem Ephratah. The Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah, and the "<b>City of David</b>". It is first mentioned in the <!--del_lnk--> Tanakh and the Bible as the place where the matriarch <!--del_lnk--> Rachel died and was buried "by the wayside" (Gen. 48:7). <!--del_lnk--> Rachel's Tomb, the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Book of Ruth, the valley to the east is where <!--del_lnk--> Ruth of <!--del_lnk--> Moab gleaned the fields and returned to town with <!--del_lnk--> Naomi. It was the home of <!--del_lnk--> Jesse, father of King <!--del_lnk--> David of <!--del_lnk--> Israel, and the site of David's anointment by the prophet <!--del_lnk--> Samuel. It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of <!--del_lnk--> Adullam.</p>
       <p>Writing in the 4th century, the <!--del_lnk--> Pilgrim of Bordeaux reported that the sepulchers of <!--del_lnk--> David, <!--del_lnk--> Ezekiel, <!--del_lnk--> Asaph, <!--del_lnk--> Job, <!--del_lnk--> Jesse, and <!--del_lnk--> Solomon were located near Bethlehem. There has been no corroboration of this.</p>

       <p>Between 132 and 135 the city was reoccupied by the Romans after its capture during the <!--del_lnk--> Bar Kokhba revolt. Its Jewish residents were expelled by the <!--del_lnk--> military order of <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian. The Romans built a shrine to the mythical <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> <!--del_lnk--> cult figure <!--del_lnk--> Adonis on the site of the Nativity. A church was erected in 326, when <!--del_lnk--> Helena, the mother of the first <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> emperor, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Constantine_the_Great.htm" title="Constantine I">Constantine</a>, visited Bethlehem.</p>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Samaritan revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed, but they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Justinian I. In 614, the <a href="../../wp/s/Sassanid_Empire.htm" title="Sassanid Empire">Persian Sassanid Empire</a>, supported by <!--del_lnk--> Jewish rebels, invaded <!--del_lnk--> Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the <!--del_lnk--> magi depicted in <!--del_lnk--> Persian clothing in a mosaic.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Islamic_and_Crusader_rule">Islamic and Crusader rule</span></h3>
       <p>In 637, shortly after <!--del_lnk--> Jerusalem was captured by the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim armies, <!--del_lnk--> 'Umar ibn al-Khatt&#x101;b, the second <!--del_lnk--> Caliph, promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use. A <!--del_lnk--> mosque dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church. Bethlehem then passed through the control of the Islamic caliphates of the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyads in the 8th century, then the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid_Caliphate.htm" title="Abbasid Caliphate">Abbasids</a> in the 9th century. A <!--del_lnk--> Persian geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, the <a href="../../wp/a/Arab_people.htm" title="Arab people">Arab</a> geographer <!--del_lnk--> al-Muqaddasi visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the "Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round." In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph, <!--del_lnk--> al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure's southern transept.</p>
       <p>In 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the <a href="../../wp/f/First_Crusade.htm" title="First Crusade">Crusaders</a>, who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The <!--del_lnk--> Greek Orthodox clergy were removed from their <!--del_lnk--> sees and replaced with <a href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Catholic Church">Latin</a> clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, <!--del_lnk--> Baldwin I, first king of the Frankish <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Jerusalem, was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.</p>
       <p>In 1187, <a href="../../wp/s/Saladin.htm" title="Saladin">Saladin</a>, the Sultan of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> who led the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim Ayyubids, captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> William IV, Count of Nevers had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of <!--del_lnk--> Clamecy in present-day <!--del_lnk--> Burgundy, France. As such, The Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous '<!--del_lnk--> in partibus infidelium' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> in 1789.</p>
       <p>Bethlehem&mdash;along with Jerusalem, <!--del_lnk--> Nazareth, and <!--del_lnk--> Sidon&mdash;was briefly ceded to the Crusader <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Jerusalem by a treaty between <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="../../wp/f/Frederick_II%252C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.htm" title="Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor">Frederick II</a> and Ayyubid Sultan <!--del_lnk--> al-Kamil in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244.</p>
       <p>In 1250, with the coming to power of the <!--del_lnk--> Mamluks under <!--del_lnk--> Rukn al-Din Baibars, tolerance of Christianity declined; the clergies left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the <!--del_lnk--> Armenians.</p>

       <p>From 1517, during the years of <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Orthodox Church">Orthodox churches</a>. By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 <!--del_lnk--> akce.</p>
       <p>Bethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley, and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader; five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).</p>
       <p>From 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Ali Dynasty of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of <!--del_lnk--> Ibrahim Pasha. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once more and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, <!--del_lnk--> compulsory military service, and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>. An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water crippled the town's growth.</p>

       <p>Bethlehem was administered by the <!--del_lnk--> British Mandate from 1920 to 1948. In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_General_Assembly.htm" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> 1947 resolution to partition Palestine, Bethlehem was included in the special <!--del_lnk--> international enclave of Jerusalem to be administered by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> captured the city during the <!--del_lnk--> 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Many refugees from areas captured by <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israeli</a> forces in 1947&ndash;48 fled to the Bethlehem area, primarily settling in the what became the official refugee camps of <!--del_lnk--> 'Azza (Beit Jibrin) and <!--del_lnk--> 'Aida in the north and <!--del_lnk--> Dheisheh in the south. The influx of refugees significantly transformed Bethlehem's Christian majority into a Muslim one.</p>
       <p>Jordan retained control of the city until the <!--del_lnk--> Six-Day War in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the <a href="../../wp/w/West_Bank.htm" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city. In 1995, Israel turned it over to the Palestinian National Authority in accordance with the <!--del_lnk--> Oslo peace accord.</p>

       <p>On December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem, and three days later the city came under the complete administration and military control of the <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian National Authority in conformance with the <!--del_lnk--> Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1995.</p>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Second Palestinian Intifada, in 2000-2005, Bethlehem's infrastructure and <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism industry</a> were severely damaged.

       <p>According to Ottoman tax records, Christians made up roughly 60% of the population in the early 16th century, while the Christian and <!--del_lnk--> Muslim population became equal by the mid-16th century. However, there were no Muslim inhabitants counted by the end of the century, with a recorded population of 287 adult male tax-payers. Christians, like all non-Muslims throughout the Ottoman Empire, were required to pay the <!--del_lnk--> jizya tax. In 1867 an American visitor describes the town as having a population of 3,000 to 4,000; of whom about 100 were <!--del_lnk--> Protestants, 300 were Muslims and "the remainder belonging to the Latin and Greek Churches with a few Armenians." Another report from the same year puts the Christian population at 3,000, with an additional 50 Muslims.</p>
       <p>In 1948, the religious makeup of the city was 85% <!--del_lnk--> Christian, mostly of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic denominations, and 13% Muslim. In the 1967 census taken by Israel authorities, the town of Bethlehem proper numbered 14,439 inhabitants, its 7,790 Muslim inhabitants represented 53.9% of the population, while the Christians of various denominations numbered 6,231 or 46.1%.</p>
       <p>In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 21,670, including a total of 6,570 <!--del_lnk--> refugees, accounting for 30.3% of the city's population. In 1997, the age distribution of Bethlehem's inhabitants was 27.4% under the age of 10, 20% from 10 to 19, 17.3% from 20-29, 17.7% from 30 to 44, 12.1% from 45-64 and 5.3% above the age of 65. There were 11,079 males and 10,594 females.</p>
       <p>According to a PCBS estimate, Bethlehem's population was 29,930 in mid 2006. The 2007 PCBS census, however, revealed a population of 25,266, of which 12,753 were males and 12,513 were females. There were 6,709 housing units, of which 5,211 were households. The average household consisted of 4.8 family members.</p>
       <p>By 2005, the proportion of Christian residents had decreased dramatically, to about 40% from 50%. The only mosque in the Old City is the <!--del_lnk--> Mosque of Omar, located in the Manger Square.</p>

       <p>Many of Bethlehem's Christian inhabitants claim ancestry from <!--del_lnk--> Arab Christian clans from the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Peninsula, including the city's two largest: al-Farahiyya and an-Najajreh. The former claims to have descended from the <!--del_lnk--> Ghassanids who migrated from <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> to the <!--del_lnk--> Wadi Musa area in present-day <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> and an-Najajreh descend from the Arabs of <!--del_lnk--> Najran in the southern <!--del_lnk--> Hejaz.

       <p>The percentage of Christians in the town has been steadily falling, primarily due to emigration. The lower birth rate of Christians also accounts for some of the decline. In 1947, Christians made up 85% of the population, but by 1998 the figure had declined to 40%. In 2005, the mayor of Bethlehem, <!--del_lnk--> Victor Batarseh explained that "due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority."The Palestinian Authority is officially committed to equality for Christians, although there have been incidents of violence against them by the <!--del_lnk--> Preventive Security Service and militant factions.</p>
       <p>The outbreak of the <!--del_lnk--> Second Intifada and the resultant decrease in tourism also affected the Christian minority, as they are the owners of many Bethlehem hotels and services that cater to foreign tourists. A <a href="../../wp/s/Statistics.htm" title="Statistics">statistical analysis</a> of the Christian exodus cited lack of economic and educational opportunity, especially due to the Christians' <!--del_lnk--> middle-class status and <!--del_lnk--> higher education. Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city.</p>
       <p>In 2006, the Palestinian Centre for Research and Cultural Dialogue conducted a poll among the city's Christians according to which 90% said they had had Muslim friends, 73.3% agreed that the PNA treated Christian heritage in the city with respect and 78% attributed the exodus of Christians to the Israeli travel restrictions.</p>

       <p>Two accounts in the <a href="../../wp/n/New_Testament.htm" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> describe <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> as being born in Bethlehem. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Gospel of Luke, <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>' parents lived in <!--del_lnk--> Nazareth and travelled for the <!--del_lnk--> Census of Quirinius to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born, after which they returned home. The <!--del_lnk--> Gospel of Matthew account implies that the family already lived in Bethlehem and later fled to Nazareth to escape persecution. Matthew says that <!--del_lnk--> Herod the Great, told that a 'King of the Jews' has been born in Bethlehem, ordered the killing of all the children aged two and under in the town and surrounding areas. <!--del_lnk--> Joseph is warned of this in a dream, and the family escapes this fate by fleeing to Egypt and returning only after Herod has died. Most modern biographers of Herod doubt the massacre was a real event.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Early Christians interpreted a verse in the <!--del_lnk--> Book of Micah as a prophecy of the birth of the <!--del_lnk--> Messiah in Bethlehem. Modern scholars question whether Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth of Jesus as fulfillment of prophecy and imply a connection to the lineage of King David. The <!--del_lnk--> Gospel of Mark and the <!--del_lnk--> Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in <!--del_lnk--> <i>Archaeology</i> magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence of the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in <!--del_lnk--> Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, <!--del_lnk--> Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, near Jerusalem.</p>
       <p>The existence of early traditions of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is attested by the <!--del_lnk--> Christian apologist <!--del_lnk--> Justin Martyr, who stated in his <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i> (c. 155&ndash;161) that the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Family had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town. <!--del_lnk--> Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus.</p>

One such festival is the annual <!--del_lnk--> Feast of Saint George (<!--del_lnk--> al-Khadr) on 5&ndash;6 May. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of <!--del_lnk--> al-Khader to baptize newborns in the waters around the <!--del_lnk--> Monastery of St. George and sacrifice a sheep in ritual.

       <p>Tourism is Bethlehem's main industry and unlike other Palestinian localities before 2000, the majority of the working residents did not work in Israel. Over 25% of the working population was employed directly or indirectly in the industry. Tourism accounts for approximately 65% of the city's economy and 11% of the <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian National Authority.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Church of the Nativity is one of Bethlehem's major <!--del_lnk--> tourist attractions and a magnet for Christian pilgrims. It stands in the centre of the city &mdash; a part of the <!--del_lnk--> Manger Square &mdash; over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, where Jesus supposedly was born.

       <p>The women embroiderers of Bethlehem were known for their bridalwear. Bethlehem embroidery was renowned for its "strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance." Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat (<i>bisht</i>) from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short <i>taqsireh</i> jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of <!--del_lnk--> velvet or <!--del_lnk--> broadcloth, usually with heavy embroidery.</p>

       <p>Bethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for "royal" <!--del_lnk--> wedding dresses (<i>thob malak</i>), taqsirehs and the <i>shatwehs</i> worn by married women. It has been traced by some to <!--del_lnk--> Byzantium, and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.</p>

       <p>Bethlehem is the <i>muhfaza</i> (seat) or district capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Bethlehem Governorate.</p>
       <p>Bethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the <i>mukhtars</i> ("heads") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A <!--del_lnk--> Basic Law was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.</p>
       <p>Throughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah <!--del_lnk--> Bedouins and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.</p>
       <p>Today, the Bethlehem Municipal Council consists of 15 elected members, including the mayor and deputy mayor. A special statute requires that the mayor and a majority of the municipal council be Christian, while the remainder are open seats, not restricted to any religion.</p>
       <p>There are several branches of political parties on the council, including <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communist</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the <!--del_lnk--> Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the <!--del_lnk--> Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. <!--del_lnk--> Hamas gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian municipal elections.</p>
       <p>In the October 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Vera Baboun won, becoming the first female mayor of Bethlehem.</p>
