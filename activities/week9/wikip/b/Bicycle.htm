       <p>A <b>bicycle</b>, often called a <b>bike</b> (and sometimes referred to as a "pushbike", "pedal bike", "pedal cycle", or "cycle"), is a <!--del_lnk--> human-powered, <!--del_lnk--> pedal-driven, <!--del_lnk--> single-track vehicle, having two <!--del_lnk--> wheels attached to a <!--del_lnk--> frame, one behind the other. A person who rides a bicycle is called a <!--del_lnk--> cyclist, or bicyclist.</p>
       <p>Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe and now number more than a billion worldwide, twice as many as <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">automobiles</a>. They are the principal <!--del_lnk--> means of transportation in many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for such uses as children's toys, general fitness, military and police applications, courier services and bicycle racing.</p>
       <p>The basic shape and configuration of a typical <!--del_lnk--> upright, or safety bicycle, has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885. However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials and <!--del_lnk--> computer-aided design. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for diverse types of cycling.</p>
       <p>The invention of the bicycle has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were invented for the bicycle, including <!--del_lnk--> ball bearings, <!--del_lnk--> pneumatic tires, chain-driven <!--del_lnk--> sprockets, and <!--del_lnk--> tension-spoked wheels.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>The word <i>bicycle</i> was used in English print in the London <i><!--del_lnk--> The Daily News</i> in 1868, from the French term <i>bicyclette</i> which had been used as an adjective in 1847, and as a noun by 1868. Before that, and in some places thereafter, bikes were known primarily as <!--del_lnk--> velocipedes.</p>

It is regarded as the forerunner of the modern bicycle and was introduced by Drais to the public in <!--del_lnk--> Mannheim in summer 1817 and in Paris in 1818. Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his/her feet while steering the front wheel.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The first mechanically-propelled 2-wheel vehicle may have been built by <!--del_lnk--> Kirkpatrick MacMillan, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed. He is also associated with the first recorded instance of a <!--del_lnk--> cycling traffic offense, when a <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> newspaper in 1842 reported an accident in which an anonymous "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design" knocked over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five <!--del_lnk--> shillings.</p>
       <p>In the early 1860s, Frenchmen <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Michaux and <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Lallement took bicycle design in a new direction by adding a mechanical <!--del_lnk--> crank drive with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the <!--del_lnk--> velocipede). Another French inventor by the name of Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman <!--del_lnk--> Thomas McCall in 1869. The French creation, made of iron and wood, developed into the "<!--del_lnk--> penny-farthing" (historically known as an "ordinary bicycle", a <!--del_lnk--> retronym, since there was then no other kind). It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their high seat and poor <!--del_lnk--> weight distribution. In 1868 a Michaux cycle was brought to <a href="../../wp/c/Coventry.htm" title="Coventry">Coventry</a>, England by Rowley Turner, sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the Coventry Machinist Company). His uncle, Josiah Turner, together with business partner <!--del_lnk--> James Starley used this as a basis for the 'Coventry Model' in what became Britain's first cycle factory.</p>
       <p>The <i>dwarf ordinary</i> addressed some of these faults by reducing the front wheel diameter and setting the seat further back. This necessitated the addition of gearing, effected in a variety of ways, to efficiently use the power available. Having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. <!--del_lnk--> J. K. Starley (nephew of James Starley), J. H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the <!--del_lnk--> chain drive (originated by the unsuccessful "bicyclette" of Englishman Henry Lawson), connecting the frame-mounted cranks to the rear wheel. These models were known as <!--del_lnk--> safety bicycles, dwarf safeties, or upright bicycles for their lower seat height and better weight distribution, although without pneumatic tires the ride of the smaller-wheeled bicycle would be much rougher than that of the larger-wheeled variety. Starley's 1885 <!--del_lnk--> Rover, manufactured in Coventry, England, is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle. Soon, the <i>seat tube</i> was added, creating the double-triangle <i>diamond frame</i> of the modern bike.</p>
       <p>Further innovations increased comfort and ushered in a second <!--del_lnk--> bicycle craze, the 1890s' <i>Golden Age of Bicycles</i>. In 1888, Scotsman <!--del_lnk--> John Boyd Dunlop introduced the first practical pneumatic tire, which soon became universal. Soon after, the rear <!--del_lnk--> freewheel was developed, enabling the rider to coast. This refinement led to the 1890s invention of <!--del_lnk--> coaster brakes. <!--del_lnk--> d&eacute;railleur gears and hand-operated <!--del_lnk--> Bowden cable-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders. By the turn of the century, <!--del_lnk--> cycling clubs flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, and touring and racing became widely popular.</p>
       <p>Bicycles and horse buggies were the two mainstays of private transportation just prior to the automobile, and the grading of smooth roads in the late 19th century was stimulated by the widespread advertising, production, and use of these devices.</p>

       <p>Bicycles can be categorized in different ways: such as by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include <!--del_lnk--> utility bicycles, <!--del_lnk--> mountain bicycles, <!--del_lnk--> racing bicycles, <!--del_lnk--> touring bicycles, <!--del_lnk--> hybrid bicycles, <!--del_lnk--> cruiser bicycles, and <!--del_lnk--> BMX Bikes. Less common are <!--del_lnk--> tandems, <!--del_lnk--> lowriders, <!--del_lnk--> tall bikes, <!--del_lnk--> fixed gear, <!--del_lnk--> folding models, <!--del_lnk--> amphibious bicycles and <!--del_lnk--> recumbents.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Unicycles, <!--del_lnk--> tricycles and <!--del_lnk--> quadracycles are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one, three and four wheels, but are often referred to informally as "bikes".</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dynamics">Dynamics</span></h3>
       <p>A bicycle stays upright while moving forward by being steered so as to keep its <a href="../../wp/c/Center_of_mass.htm" title="Center of mass">centre of mass</a> over the wheels. This steering is usually provided by the rider, but under certain conditions may be provided by the bicycle itself.</p>
       <p>The combined centre of mass of a bicycle and its rider must lean into a turn to successfully navigate it. This lean is induced by a method known as <!--del_lnk--> countersteering, which can be performed by the rider turning the handlebars directly with the <!--del_lnk--> hands or indirectly by leaning the bicycle.</p>
       <p>Short-wheelbase or tall bicycles, when braking, can generate enough stopping force at the front wheel to flip longitudinally. The act of purposefully using this force to lift the rear wheel and balance on the front without tipping over is a trick known as a <!--del_lnk--> stoppie, endo or front wheelie.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Performance">Performance</span></h3>
       <p>The bicycle is extraordinarily efficient in both biological and mechanical terms. The bicycle is the most efficient human-powered means of transportation in terms of energy a person must expend to travel a given distance. From a mechanical viewpoint, up to 99% of the energy delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels, although the use of gearing mechanisms may reduce this by 10&ndash;15%. In terms of the ratio of cargo weight a bicycle can carry to total weight, it is also an efficient means of cargo transportation.</p>

       </div>
       <p>A human traveling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around 10&ndash;15&nbsp;mph (16&ndash;24&nbsp;km/h) uses only the energy required to walk. Air drag, which is proportional to the square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs as speeds increase. If the rider is sitting upright, the rider's body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider combination. Drag can be reduced by seating the rider in a more <!--del_lnk--> aerodynamically streamlined position. Drag can also be reduced by covering the bicycle with an aerodynamic <!--del_lnk--> fairing.</p>
       <p>In addition, the <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> generated in the production and transportation of the food required by the bicyclist, per mile traveled, is less than 1/10 that generated by energy efficient cars.</p>

       <p>The great majority of today's bicycles have a frame with upright seating which looks much like the first chain-driven bike. Such upright bicycles almost always feature the <i>diamond frame</i>, a <!--del_lnk--> truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube and seat tube. The head tube contains the <!--del_lnk--> headset, the set of bearings that allows the <!--del_lnk--> fork to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the <!--del_lnk--> bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the <!--del_lnk--> chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear <!--del_lnk--> dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Historically, women's bicycle frames had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower <!--del_lnk--> standover height at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a <i><!--del_lnk--> step-through frame</i>, allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the <i><!--del_lnk--> mixte</i>, which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a "women's" bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.</p>
       <p>Step-throughs were popular partly for practical reasons and partly for social mores of the day. For most of the history of bicycles' popularity women have worn long skirts, and the lower frame accommodated these better than the top-tube. Furthermore it was considered "unladylike" for women to open their legs to mount and dismount - in more conservative times women who rode bicycles at all were vilified as immoral or immodest. These practices were akin to the older practice of riding horse <!--del_lnk--> sidesaddle.</p>
       <p>Another style is the recumbent bicycle. These are inherently more aerodynamic than upright versions, as the rider may lean back onto a support and operate pedals that are on about the same level as the seat. The world's fastest bicycle is a recumbent bicycle but this type was banned from competition in 1934 by the <!--del_lnk--> Union Cycliste Internationale.</p>
       <p>Historically, materials used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. In the 1980s aluminum alloy frames and other components became popular due to their light weight, and most mid-range bikes are now principally aluminium alloy of some kind. More expensive bikes use <!--del_lnk--> carbon fibre due to its significantly lighter weight and profiling ability, allowing designers to make a bike both stiff and compliant by manipulating the lay-up. Other exotic frame materials include <a href="../../wp/t/Titanium.htm" title="Titanium">titanium</a> and advanced alloys. <!--del_lnk--> Bamboo, a natural <!--del_lnk--> composite material with high strength-to-weight ratio and <!--del_lnk--> stiffness has been used for bicycles since 1894. Recent versions use bamboo for the primary frame with glued metal connections and parts, priced as exotic models. </p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The <i>drivetrain</i> begins with pedals which rotate the <!--del_lnk--> cranks, which are held in axis by the bottom bracket. Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A very small number of bicycles use a shaft drive to transmit power, or special belts. Hydraulic bicycle transmissions have been built, but they are currently inefficient and complex.</p>
       <p>Since cyclists' legs are most efficient over a narrow range of pedaling speeds, or <!--del_lnk--> cadence, a variable <!--del_lnk--> gear ratio helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use hub gears with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient d&eacute;railleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A d&eacute;railleur system normally has two d&eacute;railleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the <!--del_lnk--> chainring and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes have two or three chainrings, and between 5 and 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Different gears and ranges of gears are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.</p>

       </div>
       <p>With a <i>chain drive</i> transmission, a <i>chainring</i> attached to a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (<!--del_lnk--> cassette or <!--del_lnk--> freewheel). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built in to rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Steering_and_seating">Steering and seating</span></h4>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> handlebars turn the fork and the front wheel via the <!--del_lnk--> stem, which rotates within the headset. Three styles of handlebar are common. <i>Upright handlebars</i>, the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. <i>Drop handlebars</i> "drop" as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic "crouched" position, as well as more upright positions in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.</p>

       </div>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Saddles also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men.</p>
       <p>A recumbent bicycle has a reclined <!--del_lnk--> chair-like seat that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat <!--del_lnk--> steering.</p>

       <p>Modern bicycle <i>brakes</i> may be: <i>rim brakes</i>, in which friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims; <i>internal hub brakes</i>, in which the friction pads are contained within the wheel hubs; or <i>disc brakes</i>, with a separate rotor for braking. <!--del_lnk--> Disc brakes are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on road-specific bicycles, due to their increased weight and complexity.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or <!--del_lnk--> hydraulic lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal <i>coaster brakes</i> which were popular in North America until the 1960s.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Track bicycles do not have brakes, because all riders ride in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Suspension">Suspension</span></h4>
       <p>Bicycle suspension refers to the system or systems used to <i>suspend</i> the rider and all or part of the bicycle. This serves two purposes: to keep the wheels in continuous contact with the ground, improving control, and to isolate the rider and luggage from jarring due to rough surfaces, improving comfort.</p>
       <p>Bicycle suspensions are used primarily on mountain bicycles, but are also common on hybrid bicycles, as they can help deal with problematic vibration from poor surfaces. Suspension is especially important on recumbent bicycles, since while an upright bicycle rider can stand on the pedals to achieve some of the benefits of suspension, a recumbent rider cannot.</p>
       <p>Basic mountain bicycles and hybrids usually have front suspension only, whilst more sophisticated ones also have rear suspension. Road bicycles tend to have no suspension, due to weight and stiffness concerns, although may have special designs to increase compliance.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Wheels_and_tires">Wheels and tires</span></h4>
       <p>The wheel axle fits into fork ends in the frame and fork. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, especially in the context of ready-built "off the shelf", performance-oriented wheels.</p>
       <p>Tires vary enormously depending on their intended purpose. <!--del_lnk--> Road bicycles use tires 18 to 25 millimeters wide, most often completely smooth, or <!--del_lnk--> slick, and inflated to high pressure in order to roll fast on smooth surfaces. Off-road tires are usually between 38 and 64 mm (1.5 and 2.5 in) wide, and have treads for gripping in muddy conditions or metal studs for ice.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> <i>Toe-clips</i> and <i>toestraps</i> and <!--del_lnk--> clipless pedals help keep the foot locked in the proper position on the pedals, and enable the cyclist to pull as well as push the pedals&mdash;although not without their hazards, e.g. may lock foot in when needed to prevent a fall.

       <p>Recently a number of cities around the world have implemented successful schemes known as <!--del_lnk--> bicycle sharing systems or community bicycle programs. These initiatives complement a city's public transport system and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution. In Europe, especially in The Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, commuting by bicycle is very common. In the Danish capital of <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy, that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.</p>
       <p>In The Netherlands all train stations are equipped with provisions for bicycle parking for free, or a more secure parking place for a small fee, with the larger stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded. In <!--del_lnk--> Trondheim in Norway, the <!--del_lnk--> Trampe bicycle lift has been developed to encourage cyclists by giving assistance on a steep hill. Buses in many cities have <!--del_lnk--> bicycle carriers mounted on the front.</p>
       <p>There are towns in some countries where <!--del_lnk--> bicycle culture has been an integral part of the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That is the case of <!--del_lnk--> &Iacute;lhavo, in Portugal.</p>
       <p>In cities where the bicycle is not an integral part of the planned transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements of a <!--del_lnk--> mixed-mode commute, where the bike is used to travel to and from train stations or other forms of rapid transit. Some students who commute several miles drive a car from home to a campus parking lot, then ride a bicycle to class. <!--del_lnk--> Folding bicycles are useful in these scenarios, as they are less cumbersome when carried aboard. Los Angeles removed a small amount of seating on some trains to make more room for bicycles and wheel chairs.</p>

       <p>Bicycles offer an important mode of transport in many developing countries. Until recently, bicycles have been a staple of everyday life throughout Asian countries. They are the most frequently used method of transport for commuting to work, school, shopping, and life in general. They also offer a degree of exercise to keep the individual healthy.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Poverty_alleviation">Poverty alleviation</span></h3>
       <p>Experiments done in Uganda, Tanzania and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%. Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural <!--del_lnk--> poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3-10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.</p>

       <p>The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Feminism.htm" title="Emancipation of women">their emancipation</a> in Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolize the <!--del_lnk--> New Woman of the late 19th century, especially in Britain and the United States. The <!--del_lnk--> bicycle craze in the 1890s also led to a movement for so-called <!--del_lnk--> rational dress, which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other restrictive garments, substituting the then-shocking <!--del_lnk--> bloomers.</p>
       <p>The bicycle was recognized by 19th-century feminists and <!--del_lnk--> suffragists as a "freedom machine" for women. American <a href="../../wp/s/Susan_B._Anthony.htm" title="Susan B. Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a> said in a <i><!--del_lnk--> New York World</i> interview on February 2, 1896: "I think it has done more to emancipate woman than any one thing in the world. I rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives her a feeling of self reliance and independence the moment she takes her seat; and away she goes, the picture of untrammelled womanhood." In 1895 <!--del_lnk--> Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the <!--del_lnk--> Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union, wrote <i>A Wheel Within a Wheel: How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle, with Some Reflections by the Way</i>, a 75 page illustrated memoir praising "Gladys", her bicycle, for its "gladdening effect" on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Bicycle manufacturing proved to be a training ground for other industries and led to the development of advanced metalworking techniques, both for the frames themselves and for special components such as <!--del_lnk--> ball bearings, <!--del_lnk--> washers, and sprockets. These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components used in early automobiles and aircraft.</p>
       <p>They also served to teach the industrial models later adopted, including mechanization and <!--del_lnk--> mass production (later copied and adopted by <a href="../../wp/f/Ford_Motor_Company.htm" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a> and <!--del_lnk--> General Motors), vertical integration (also later copied and adopted by Ford), aggressive advertising (as much as 10% of all advertising in U.S. periodicals in 1898 was by bicycle makers), lobbying for better roads (which had the side benefit of acting as advertising, and of improving sales by providing more places to ride), all first practiced by Pope. In addition, bicycle makers adopted the annual model change (later derided as <!--del_lnk--> planned obsolescence, and usually credited to General Motors), which proved very successful.</p>
       <p>Early bicycles were an example of <!--del_lnk--> conspicuous consumption, being adopted by the fashionable elites. In addition, by serving as a platform for accessories, which could ultimately cost more than the bicycle itself, it paved the way for the likes of the <!--del_lnk--> Barbie doll.</p>
       <p>Bicycles helped create, or enhance, new kinds of businesses, such as bicycle messengers, traveling seamstresses, riding academies, and racing rinks Their board tracks were later adapted to early <!--del_lnk--> motorcycle and <!--del_lnk--> automobile racing. There were a variety of new inventions, such as <!--del_lnk--> spoke tighteners, and specialized lights, socks and shoes, and even cameras, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Eastman Company's Poco. Probably the best known and most widely used of these inventions, adopted well beyond cycling, is Charles Bennett's Bike Web, which came to be called the <!--del_lnk--> jock strap.</p>

       <p>They also presaged a move away from public transit that would explode with the introduction of the automobile.</p>
       <p>J. K. Starley's company became the Rover Cycle Company Ltd. in the late 1890s, and then simply the <!--del_lnk--> Rover Company when it started making cars. <!--del_lnk--> Morris Motors LImited (in <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>) and <!--del_lnk--> &Scaron;koda also began in the bicycle business, as did the <a href="../../wp/w/Wright_brothers.htm" title="Wright brothers">Wright brothers</a>. Alistair Craig, whose company eventually emerged to become the engine manufacturers <!--del_lnk--> Ailsa Craig, also started from manufacturing bicycles, in Glasgow in March 1885.</p>
       <p>In general, U.S. and European cycle manufacturers used to assemble cycles from their own frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom brackets, axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.</p>
       <p>Many newer or smaller companies only design and market their products; the actual production is done by Asian companies. For example, some 60% of the world's bicycles are now being made in China. Despite this shift in production, as nations such as China and India become more wealthy, their own use of bicycles has declined due to the increasing affordability of cars and motorcycles. One of the major reasons for the proliferation of Chinese-made bicycles in foreign markets is the lower cost of labor in China.</p>
       <p>One of the profound economic implications of bicycle use is that it liberates the user from oil consumption.(Ballantine, 1972) The bicycle is an inexpensive, fast, healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport.(Illich, 1974)</p>
       <p>In line with the European financial crisis, in Italy in 2011 the number of bicycle sales (1.75 million) just passed the number of new car sales.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Manufacturing">Manufacturing</span></h3>
       <p>The global bicycle market is $61 billion in 2011. As of 2009 130 million bicycles were sold every year globally and 66% of them were made in China.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_requirements">Legal requirements</span></h3>
       <p>Early in its development, as with <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">automobiles</a>, there were restrictions on the operation of bicycles. Along with advertising, and to gain free publicity, <!--del_lnk--> Albert A. Pope litigated on behalf of cyclists.</p>
       <p>The 1968 <!--del_lnk--> Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator. The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements before it can be used on public roads. In many <!--del_lnk--> jurisdictions, it is an offense to use a bicycle that is not in a roadworthy condition.</p>
       <p>In most jurisdictions, bicycles must have functioning front and rear lights when ridden after dark. As some generator or <!--del_lnk--> dynamo-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear <!--del_lnk--> reflectors are frequently also mandatory. Since a moving bicycle makes little noise, some countries insist that bicycles have a warning bell for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians, and other cyclists, though sometimes a <!--del_lnk--> car horn can be used when a 12 volt battery is available.</p>
       <p>Some countries require child and/or adult cyclists to wear helmets, as this may protect riders from head trauma. Countries which require adult cyclists to wear helmets include Spain, <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand and Australia. Mandatory helmet wearing is one of the most controversial topics in the cycling world, with proponents arguing that it reduces head injuries and thus is an acceptable requirement, while opponents argue that by making cycling seem more dangerous and cumbersome, it reduces cyclist numbers on the streets, creating an overall negative health effect (fewer people cycling for their own health, and the remaining cyclists being more exposed through a reversed <!--del_lnk--> safety in numbers effect).</p>
