       <p><b>Berbers</b> are the indigenous <a href="../../wp/e/Ethnic_group.htm" title="Ethnic group">peoples</a> of <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> west of the Nile Valley. They are discontinuously distributed from the Atlantic to the <!--del_lnk--> Siwa oasis, in <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> to the <a href="../../wp/n/Niger_River.htm" title="Niger River">Niger River</a>. They speak various <a href="../../wp/b/Berber_languages.htm" title="Berber languages">Berber languages</a>, which together form a branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Afroasiatic language family. Between fourteen and twenty-five million Berber speakers live within this region, most densely in <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> and becoming generally scarcer eastward through the rest of the <a href="../../wp/m/Maghreb.htm" title="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> and beyond.</p>
       <p>Many Berbers call themselves some variant of the word <i>Imazighen</i> (singular <i>Amazigh</i>), meaning "free men". This is common in Morocco, but elsewhere within the Berber homeland a local, more particular term, such as <!--del_lnk--> Kabyle or <!--del_lnk--> Chaoui, is more often used instead. Historically Berbers have been variously known, for instance as <!--del_lnk--> Libyans by the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greeks</a>, as <!--del_lnk--> Numidians and <!--del_lnk--> Mauri by the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a>, and as <!--del_lnk--> Moors by medieval and early modern Europeans. The modern English term is borrowed from Arabic, but the deeper <!--del_lnk--> etymology of "Berber" is not certain. (See also: <!--del_lnk--> Berber (Etymology).)</p>

       <p>The Berbers have lived in North Africa between western Egypt and the Atlantic Ocean for as far back as records of the area go. The earliest inhabitants of the region are found on the <!--del_lnk--> Saharan rock art. References to them also occur frequently in <!--del_lnk--> ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman sources. Berber groups are first mentioned in writing by the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptians</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Predynastic Period, and during the <!--del_lnk--> New Kingdom the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians later fought against the <!--del_lnk--> Meshwesh and <!--del_lnk--> Libu <a href="../../wp/t/Tribe.htm" title="Tribe">tribes</a> on their western borders. From about 945 BC the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians were ruled by Meshwesh immigrants who founded the <!--del_lnk--> Twenty-second Dynasty under <!--del_lnk--> Shoshenq I, beginning a long period of Berber rule in Egypt. They long remained the main population of the Western Desert&mdash;the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> chroniclers often complained of the <i>Mazikes</i> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Berber_people.htm" title="Amazigh">Amazigh</a>) raiding outlying monasteries there.</p>
       <p>For many centuries the Berbers inhabited the coast of North Africa from Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean. Over time, the coastal regions of North Africa saw a long parade of invaders, settlers, and colonists including <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicians (who founded <!--del_lnk--> Carthage), <!--del_lnk--> Greeks (mainly in <!--del_lnk--> Cyrene, Libya), <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Vandals and <!--del_lnk--> Alans, <!--del_lnk--> Byzantines, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arab_people.htm" title="Arabs">Arabs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ottomans, and the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a>. Most if not all of these invaders have left some imprint upon the modern Berbers as have slaves brought from Southern Europe to the <!--del_lnk--> Barbary Coast by <!--del_lnk--> Barbary pirates (one estimate places the number of Europeans brought to North Africa during the Ottoman period as high as 1.25 million)<!--del_lnk--> . Berber interactions with neighboring Sudanic empires, sub-Saharan Africans, and nomads from East Africa have also left varying impressions upon the people across the vast expanse of north Africa.</p>
       <p>The areas of North Africa which retained the Berber language and traditions have, in general, been those least exposed to foreign rule&mdash;in particular, the highlands of Kabylie in Algeria and the Chleuh and Riffian peoples in Morocco, most of which even in Roman and Ottoman times remained largely separate and independent. The <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicians never even penetrated beyond the port cities along the coast. While many peoples have made contact and exchanged goods and services with native North Africans, full contact had been only with the Romans whereby the Numidian and Mauritanian provinces had been fully integrated as Provinces of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic, and their peoples <!--del_lnk--> Roman Citizens. Amongst the people who had entered and settled with the <!--del_lnk--> autochthonous people of North Africa, are the 80,000 families of <!--del_lnk--> Germanic <!--del_lnk--> Vandals also referred to as "The Barbarians" by the Romans and the Mediterraneans in general who neither perished nor returned to Germania, but mixed with the natives and ultimately resulted in the eviction of the Roman forces from North Africa.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Islamic_invasion">The Islamic invasion</span></h3>
       <p>Until the 7th century, the region of North Africa practiced many religions including various forms of indigenous rituals.</p>
       <p>Before the ninth century, Northwest Africa was largely Berber-speaking. It was primarily <!--del_lnk--> Sufi Muslim, with Jewish populations in the valleys and Christians in the highlands. This was particularly true in the Algerian Aures and Kabyle regions, from which came several Berber Roman Emperors, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Augustine_of_Hippo.htm" title="Saint Augustine">Saint Augustine</a>, along with the roots of Roman <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism. The main spoken language was Tamazight Berber, with <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> the chief written languages. The process of word borrowing started only around the ninth century with the <!--del_lnk--> Fatimids of Egypt. The <!--del_lnk--> Banu Hilal reduced the <!--del_lnk--> Zirids to a few coastal towns and took over much of the plains. Governments in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco encouraged the Arabization of the region, as had the French colonial regime that preceded them.</p>

Most <!--del_lnk--> Berbers who consider themselves <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arab_people.htm" title="Arab">Arab</a> also have mainly Berber ancestry<!--del_lnk--> , though this too is not exact and may be purely conjectural in such a cosmopolitan region. Prominent Berber groups include the <!--del_lnk--> Kabyles of northern Algeria, who number approximately 4 million and have kept, to a large degree, their original language and culture; and the <!--del_lnk--> Chleuh (Francophone plural of Arabic "Shalh" and <!--del_lnk--> Tashelhiyt "a&scaron;&#x259;l&#x1E25;i") of south Morocco, numbering about 8 million. Other groups include the <!--del_lnk--> Riffians of north Morocco, the <!--del_lnk--> Chaouia of Algeria, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tuareg_people.htm" title="Tuareg">Tuareg</a> of the <a href="../../wp/s/Sahara.htm" title="Sahara">Sahara</a>.

Some proportion of the inhabitants of the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands are descended from the aboriginal <!--del_lnk--> Guanches--usually considered to have common origins with Berbers--among whom a few Canary Islander customs, such as the eating of <!--del_lnk--> gofio, originated.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Although stereotyped in the West as nomads, most Berbers were in fact traditionally farmers, living in the mountains relatively close to the Mediterranean coast, or oasis dwellers; the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tuareg_people.htm" title="Tuareg">Tuareg</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Zenaga of the southern <a href="../../wp/s/Sahara.htm" title="Sahara">Sahara</a>, however, were nomadic. Some groups, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Chaouis, practiced <!--del_lnk--> transhumance.</p>
       <p>Political tensions have arisen between some Berber groups (especially the <!--del_lnk--> Kabyle) and North African governments over the past few decades, partly over linguistic and cultural issues; for instance, in <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, giving children Berber names was banned.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin">Origin</span></h2>
       <p>Various disciplines shed light on the origin of the Berbers.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Archaeology">Archaeology</span></h3>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic <!--del_lnk--> Capsian culture appeared in North Africa around 9,500 BC and lasted until possibly 2700 BC. Linguists and population geneticists alike have identified this culture as a probable period for the spread of an <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Asiatic language (ancestral to the modern Berber languages) to the area. The origins of the Capsian culture, however, are archeologically unclear. Some have regarded this culture's population as simply a continuation of the earlier <!--del_lnk--> Mesolithic <!--del_lnk--> Ibero-Maurusian culture, which appeared around ~22,000 BC, while others argue for a population change; the former view seems to be supported by dental evidence. <!--del_lnk--> </p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_Anthropology">Physical Anthropology</span></h3>
       <p>"At best we can define Berbers as <!--del_lnk--> Mediterranean. In terms of physical anthropology they are more closely related to Italians, Sicilians, Spaniards and Egyptians than to Nigerians, Saudi Arabians, or Ethiopians... .".</p>
       <p>There are also theories mixed with observations by acknowledged racists, now discredited by the scientific community, although once popular with the like-minded during the Nazi era, and earlier, which speculate about the Berber people of North Africa.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Genetic_evidence">Genetic evidence</span></h3>
       <p>In general, genetic evidence appears to indicate that most North Africans (whether they consider themselves Berber or <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arab_people.htm" title="Arab">Arab</a>) are predominantly of Berber origin and that populations ancestral to the Berbers have been in the area since the <!--del_lnk--> Upper Paleolithic era. Berbers appear to be largely descended from a group or groups of people who expanded west from an eastern origin, along the southern rim of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean sea">Mediterranean sea</a>, beginning perhaps as much as 50 000 years ago. Significant proportions of both the Berber and <!--del_lnk--> Arabized Berber gene pools also derive from more recent <!--del_lnk--> migration of various groups who have left their genetic footprints to varying degrees throughout the region.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Y-chromosome_DNA">Y-chromosome DNA</span></h4>
       <p>Y chromosomes are passed exclusively through the paternal line.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Bosch et al. (2001), found little genetic distinction between Arabic-speaking and Berber-speaking populations in North Africa, which they take to support the interpretation of the <!--del_lnk--> Arabization and <!--del_lnk--> Islamization of northwestern Africa, starting with word-borrowing during the 7th century A.D. and through State Arabic Language Officialisation post independence in 1962, as cultural phenomena without extensive genetic replacement. According to this study the historical origins of the NW African <!--del_lnk--> Y-chromosome pool may be summarized as follows: 75% NW African <!--del_lnk--> Upper Paleolithic (M78, M35, and M81), 13% <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic (J1-M267 and J2-M172), 4% historic European gene flow and 8% recent <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sub-Saharan_Africa.htm" title="Sub-Saharan African">sub-Saharan African</a>. They identify the "75% NW African Upper Paleolithic" component as "an Upper Paleolithic colonization that probably had its origin in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/East_Africa.htm" title="Eastern Africa">Eastern Africa</a>." The North-west African population's 75% Y chromosome genetic contribution from East Africa contrasted with a 78% contribution to the Iberian population from western Asia, suggests that the northern rim of the Mediterranean with the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Gibraltar acted as a strong, albeit incomplete, barrier. However this study only analysed a small sample of Moroccan Y lineages.</p>
       <p>A more recent and thorough study by <!--del_lnk--> Arredi et al. (2004) which analyzed five additional populations (Algerians and Tunisians) concludes that the North African pattern of Y-chromosomal variation (including both E3b and J haplogroups) is largely of Neolithic origin which suggests that the Neolithic transition in this part of the world was accompanied by demic diffusion of Afro-Asiatic&ndash;speaking pastoralists from the Middle East. This Neolithic origin was later confirmed by <!--del_lnk--> Myles et al. (2005) which "suggest that contemporary Berber populations possess the genetic signature of a past migration of pastoralists from the Middle East and that they share a dairying origin with Europeans and Asians, but not with sub-Saharan Africans".</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Cruciani et al. (2004) note that the E-M81 haplogroup on the Y-chromosome correlates closely with Berber populations.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Nebel et al. (2002) of the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew University argue that J1-M267 rather reflects "recent gene flow caused by the migration of <!--del_lnk--> Arabian tribes in the first millennium of the Common Era(700-800 A.D)." According to Nebel, the indigenous population of the Maghrib, the Berbers, have always been a composite people.</p>
       <p>After the 8th century CE, a process of Arabization affected the bulk of the Berbers, while the Arab-Islamic culture and population absorbed local elements as well. Under the unifying framework of Islam, on the one hand, and as a result of the Arab settlement, on the other, a fusion took place that resulted in a new ethnocultural entity all over the Maghrib. Another study on Haplogroup J (Semino et al. 2004) agrees with Nebel et al.'s suggestion that J1-M267 may have spread to North Africa in historic times (as identified by the motif YCAIIa22-YCAIIb22; Algerians 35.0%, Tunisians 30.1%), which they assume to be a marker of the Arab expansion in the early medieval period.. This theory is disputed by <!--del_lnk--> Arredi et al. 2004, who argue like Bosch et al. 2001 that the J1-M267 haplogroup (formerly H71) and North African Y-chromosomal diversity indicate a <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic-era "demic diffusion of <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Asiatic-speaking pastoralists from the Middle East."</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mitochondrial_DNA">Mitochondrial DNA</span></h4>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> mtDNA, by contrast, is inherited only from the mother.</p>
       <p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Macaulay et al. 1999, "one-third of <!--del_lnk--> Mozabite Berber mtDNAs have a Near Eastern ancestry, probably having arrived in North Africa &sim;50,000 years ago, and one-eighth have an origin in sub-Saharan Africa. Europe appears to be the source of many of the remaining sequences, with the rest having arisen either in Europe or in the Near East." [Maca-Meyer et al. 2003] analyze the "autochthonous North African lineage U6" in mtDNA, concluding that:</p>
       <p><i>The most probable origin of the proto-U6 lineage was the Near East. Around 30,000 years ago it spread to North Africa where it represents a signature of regional continuity. Subgroup U6a reflects the first African expansion from the Maghreb returning to the east in Paleolithic times. Derivative clade U6a1 signals a posterior movement from East Africa back to the Maghreb and the Near East. This migration coincides with the probable Afroasiatic linguistic expansion.</i></p>
       <p>A genetic study by <!--del_lnk--> Fadhlaoui-Zid et al. 2004 argues concerning certain exclusively North African haplotypes that "expansion of this group of lineages took place around 10,500 years ago in North Africa, and spread to neighbouring population", and apparently that a specific Northwestern African haplotype, U6, probably originated in the Near East 30,000 years ago but has not been highly preserved and accounts for 6-8% in <!--del_lnk--> southern Moroccan Berbers, 18% in <!--del_lnk--> Kabyles and 28% in Mozabites. Rando et al. 1998 (as cited by <!--del_lnk--> ) "detected female-mediated gene flow from sub-Saharan Africa to NW Africa" amounting to as much as 21.5% of the mtDNA sequences in a sample of NW African populations; the amount varied from 82% (<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tuareg_people.htm" title="Tuareg">Tuaregs</a>) to 4% (<!--del_lnk--> Rifains). This north-south gradient in the sub-Saharan contribution to the gene pool is supported by <!--del_lnk--> Esteban et al. Nevertheless, individual Berber communities display a considerably high mtDNA heterogeneity among them. The Berbers of Jerba Island, located in South Eastern Tunisia, display an 87% <!--del_lnk--> Eurasian contribution with no U6 haplotypes<!--del_lnk--> , while the Kesra of Tunisia, for example, display a much higher proportion of typical sub-Saharan mtDNA haplotypes (49%, including 4.2% of M1 haplogroup) <!--del_lnk--> Cherni L, et al., as compared to the Zriba (8%). According to the article, "The North African patchy mtDNA landscape has no parallel in other regions of the world and increasing the number of sampled populations has not been accompanied by any substantial increase in our understanding of its phylogeography. Available data up to now rely on sampling small, scattered populations, although they are carefully characterized in terms of their ethnic, linguistic, and historical backgrounds. It is therefore doubtful that this picture truly represents the complex historical demography of the region rather than being just the result of the type of samplings performed so far." <!--del_lnk--> </p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Linguistic">Linguistic</span></h3>
       <p>The Berber languages form a branch of <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Asiatic, and thus descended from the proto-Afro-Asiatic language; on the basis of <!--del_lnk--> linguistic migration theory, this is most commonly believed by historical linguists (notably <!--del_lnk--> Igor Diakonoff and <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Ehret) to have originated in east Africa no earlier than 12,000 years ago, although <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Militarev argues instead for an origin in the Middle East. Ehret specifically suggests identifying the Capsian culture with speakers of languages ancestral to Berber and/or <!--del_lnk--> Chadic, and sees the Capsian culture as having been brought there from the African coast of the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>. It is still disputed which branches of Afro-Asiatic are most closely related to Berber, but most linguists accept at least one of Semitic and Chadic as among its closest relatives within the family (see <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Asiatic languages.)</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/n/Nobiin_language.htm" title="Nobiin language">Nobiin</a> variety of <!--del_lnk--> Nubian contains several Berber loanwords, according to Bechhaus-Gerst, suggesting a former geographical distribution extending further southeast than the present.</p>
       <p>There are between 14 and 25 million speakers of Berber languages in <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> (see <a href="../../wp/b/Berber_languages.htm#Population" title="Berber languages">population estimation</a>), principally concentrated in <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> but with smaller communities as far east as <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and as far south as <a href="../../wp/b/Burkina_Faso.htm" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a>.</p>
       <p>Their languages, the <a href="../../wp/b/Berber_languages.htm" title="Berber languages">Berber languages</a>, form a branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Afroasiatic linguistic family comprising many closely related varieties, including Tarifit, <!--del_lnk--> Kabyle and <!--del_lnk--> Tashelhiyt, with a total of roughly 14-25 million speakers.
