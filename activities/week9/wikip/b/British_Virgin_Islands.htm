       <p>The <b>Virgin Islands</b>, often called the <b>British Virgin Islands</b> (<b>BVI</b>), is a <!--del_lnk--> British overseas territory, located in the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean to the east of <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. The islands make up part of the <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Islands archipelago, the remaining islands constituting the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Virgin_Islands.htm" title="United States Virgin Islands">U.S. Virgin Islands</a>. British Virgin Islands government publications had traditionally continued to commence with "<i>The Territory of the Virgin Islands</i>", but recently, more legislation now simply refers to the Territory as the "<i>British Virgin Islands</i>". </p>
       <p>The British Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of <!--del_lnk--> Tortola, <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Gorda, <!--del_lnk--> Anegada and <!--del_lnk--> Jost Van Dyke, along with over fifty other smaller islands and <!--del_lnk--> cays. Approximately fifteen of the islands are inhabited. The capital, <!--del_lnk--> Road Town, is situated on Tortola, the largest island which is approximately 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) long and 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) wide. The islands have a total population of about 22,000, of whom approximately 18,000 live on Tortola.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>The Virgin Islands were first settled by the <!--del_lnk--> Arawak from <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> around 100 BC (though there is some evidence of <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian presence on the islands as far back as 1500 BC). The Arawaks inhabited the islands until the fifteenth century when they were displaced by the more aggressive <!--del_lnk--> Caribs, a tribe from the <!--del_lnk--> Lesser Antilles islands, after whom the <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> is named.</p>
       <p>The first European sighting of the Virgin Islands was by <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> in 1493 on his second voyage to the Americas. Columbus gave them the fanciful name <i>Santa Ursula y las Once Mil V&iacute;rgenes..</i> (Saint Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins), shortened to <i>Las V&iacute;rgenes</i> (The Virgins), after the legend of <!--del_lnk--> Saint Ursula.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_Empire.htm" title="Spanish Empire">Spanish Empire</a> claimed the islands by discovery in the early sixteenth century, but never settled them, and subsequent years saw the English, Dutch, French, Spanish and Danish all jostling for control of the region, which became a notorious haunt for pirates. There is no record of any native Amerindian population in the British Virgin Islands during this period, although the native population on nearby <!--del_lnk--> St. Croix was decimated. Some Carib Amerindians still live on nearby <!--del_lnk--> Saint Croix.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> established a permanent settlement on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Tortola by 1648. In 1672, the <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> captured Tortola from the Dutch, and the English annexation of <!--del_lnk--> Anegada and <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Gorda followed in 1680. Meanwhile, over the period 1672&ndash;1733, the Danish gained control of the nearby islands of <!--del_lnk--> St. Thomas, <!--del_lnk--> St. John and <!--del_lnk--> St. Croix.</p>

       <p>The British islands were considered principally a strategic possession, but were planted when economic conditions were particularly favourable. The British introduced <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sugarcane.htm" title="Sugar cane">sugar cane</a> which was to become the main crop and source of foreign trade, and slaves were brought from <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> to work on the sugar cane plantations. The islands prospered economically until the middle of the 1800s, when a combination of the <!--del_lnk--> abolition of slavery in the Territory, a series of disastrous hurricanes, and the growth in the <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar_beet.htm" title="Sugar beet">sugar beet</a> crop in Europe and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> significantly reduced sugar cane production and led to a period of economic decline.</p>
       <p>In 1917, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> purchased St. John, St. Thomas and St. Croix from Denmark for US$25 million, renaming them the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Virgin_Islands.htm" title="United States Virgin Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a>.</p>
       <p>The British Virgin Islands were administered variously as part of the <!--del_lnk--> British Leeward Islands or with <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis.htm" title="St. Kitts and Nevis">St. Kitts and Nevis</a>, with an Administrator representing the British Government on the Islands. Separate colony status was gained for the Islands in 1960 and the Islands became autonomous in 1967. Since the 1960s, the islands have diversified away from their traditionally agriculture-based economy towards tourism and financial services, becoming one of the wealthiest areas in the Caribbean.</p>

       <p>The British Virgin Islands comprise around sixty tropical Caribbean islands, ranging in size from the largest, Tortola 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) long and 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) wide, to tiny uninhabited <!--del_lnk--> islets. They are located in the <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Islands archipelago, a few miles east of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_States_Virgin_Islands.htm" title="U.S. Virgin Islands">U.S. Virgin Islands</a>.

       <p>As a <!--del_lnk--> tax haven, the British Virgin Islands enjoys one of the more prosperous economies of the Caribbean region, with a per capita average income of around $38,500 (2004 est.)</p>
       <p>The "twin pillars" of the economy are tourism and financial services. Politically, tourism is the more important of the two, as it employs a greater number of people within the Territory, and a larger proportion of the businesses in the tourist industry are locally owned, as are a number of the highly tourism-dependent sole traders (e.g. taxi drivers and street vendors). Economically however, financial services associated with the territory's <!--del_lnk--> tax haven status are by far the more important. 51.8% of the Government's revenue comes directly from licence fees for offshore companies, and considerable further sums are raised directly or indirectly from payroll taxes relating to salaries paid within the trust industry sector (which tend to be higher on average than those paid in the tourism sector).</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">Tourism</a> accounts for 45% of national income. The islands are a popular destination for U.S. citizens. In 2006 a total of 825,603 people visited the islands (of whom 443,987 were cruise ship passengers). Tourists frequent the numerous white sand <a href="../../wp/b/Beach.htm" title="Beach">beaches</a>, visit The Baths on Virgin Gorda, <!--del_lnk--> snorkel the <!--del_lnk--> coral reefs near Anegada, or experience the well-known bars of Jost Van Dyke. The BVI are known as one of the world's greatest sailing destinations, and charter sailboats are a very popular way to visit less accessible islands. Every year since 1972 the BVI has hosted the Spring Regatta, which is a seven-day collection of sailing races throughout the islands. A substantial number of the tourists who visit the BVI are <!--del_lnk--> cruise ship passengers, although they produce far lower revenue per head than charter boat tourists and hotel based tourists. They are nonetheless important to the substantial (and politically important) taxi driving community.</p>
       <p>Substantial revenues are also generated by the registration of <!--del_lnk--> offshore companies. As of June 2008, 823,502 companies were so registered (of which 445,865 were 'active'). In 2000 KPMG reported in its survey of <!--del_lnk--> offshore jurisdictions for the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> government that over 41% of the world's offshore companies were formed in the British Virgin Islands. Since 2001, financial services in the British Virgin Islands have been regulated by the independent <!--del_lnk--> Financial Services Commission. While at one time the BVI was well regarded as a good domicile for captive insurance services, this changed beginning in recent years with the change of insurance regulators in 2007 and the government's increasing pressure to hire only locals ("<!--del_lnk--> belongers") in the insurance industry. Official reports from the Financial Services Commission reflect as of June 30, 2010 only 207 captives in the BVI. Informed sources report that the actual number is closer to 100, with the 50% decline over the last four years attributable to the lack of ability within the FSC in administering insurance companies. Beginning in 2008 there was a mass exodus of captives for better staffed jurisdictions like Anguilla.</p>
       <p>Agriculture and industry account for only a small proportion of the islands' GDP. Agricultural produce includes fruit, vegetables, sugar cane, livestock and poultry, and industries include rum distillation, construction and boat building.</p>
       <p>The official currency of the British Virgin Islands has been the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US dollar</a> since 1959, a currency also used by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Virgin_Islands.htm" title="United States Virgin Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a>.</p>
       <p>The British Virgin Islands are a major target for drug traffickers, who use the area as a gateway to the United States. According to the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, "Problems associated with drug trafficking are potentially the most serious threat to stability in the BVI".</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Demographics">Demographics</span></h2>
       <p>The population of the Islands is around 21,730 in 2003. The majority of the population (83%) are <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Caribbean, descended from the slaves brought to the islands by the British. Other large ethnic groups include those of British and other European origin.</p>
       <p>The 2004 census reports:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>83.4% African / negroid</dd>
        <dd><span style="white-space:nowrap;">&nbsp;</span>7% European or caucasian</dd>
        <dd><span style="white-space:nowrap;">&nbsp;</span>9.6% Others*</dd>
       </dl>
       <p><span style="font-size:90%;">* includes Indian , Carib Amerindian and mixed</span></p>
       <p>The islands are predominantly <!--del_lnk--> Protestant <!--del_lnk--> Christian (86%). The largest individual Christian denominations are <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Methodism.htm" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> (33%), <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> (17%), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Muslims constitute approximately 1.2% of the population according to a 2009 <!--del_lnk--> Pew Research Centre report.</p>
       <p>The islands are heavily dependent upon migrant labour. In 2004 migrant workers accounted for 50% of the total population. 32% of workers employed in the British Virgin Islands work for the Government.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport">Transport</span></h2>
       <p>There are 113 kilometres (70&nbsp;mi) of roads. The main airport (<!--del_lnk--> Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport, also known as Beef Island Airport) is located on Beef Island, which lies off the eastern tip of Tortola and is accessible by the <!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. Virgin Gorda and Anegada have their own smaller airports. The main harbour is in <!--del_lnk--> Road Town. There are also ferries that operate within the British Virgin Islands and to the neighbouring United States Virgin Islands. As in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, cars in the British Virgin Islands drive on the left side of the road. The roads are often quite steep and winding, and ruts can be a problem when it rains.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h2>
       <p>The British Virgin Islands operates several government schools as well as private schools. There is also a community college, <!--del_lnk--> H. Lavity Stoutt Community College, that is located on the eastern end of Tortola. This college was named after Honourable <!--del_lnk--> Lavity Stoutt (Chief Minister).</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sport">Sport</span></h2>
       <p>Because of its location and climate the British Virgin Islands has long been a haven for sailing enthusiasts. Sailing is regarded as one of the foremost sports in all of the BVI. Calm waters along with steady breezes culminate to make some of the best sailing conditions in the Caribbean (some say the world). Many sailing events are held in the waters of this country, the largest of which is a week-long series of sailing races called the Spring Regatta.</p>
       <p>This is the premier sailing event of the Caribbean. With several races hosted each day. Boats include everything from full-size mono-hull yachts to dinghies. Captains and their crews come from all around the globe to attend these races. The Spring Regatta is part race, part party, part festival. There are races, games, and music during the day, and some crazy partying at night. The Spring Regatta is normally held on the first week of April, annually <!--del_lnk--> .</p>

       <p>The primary language is English with a quick creole accent.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Music">Music</span></h3>
       <p>The traditional music of the British Virgin Islands is called <i>fungi</i> after the local <!--del_lnk--> cornmeal dish with the same name, often made with <!--del_lnk--> okra. The special sound of fungi is due to a unique local fusion between African and European music. It functions as a medium of local history and folklore and is therefore a cherished cultural form of expression that is part of the curriculum in BVI schools. The fungi bands, also called "scratch bands", use instruments ranging from <!--del_lnk--> calabash, washboard, <!--del_lnk--> bongos and <a href="../../wp/u/Ukulele.htm" title="Ukulele">ukulele</a>, to more traditional western instruments like keyboard, banjo, guitar, bass, triangle and saxophone. Apart from being a form of festive dance music, fungi often contains humorous social commentaries, as well as BVI oral history. The popular singer <!--del_lnk--> Iyaz is from the British Virgin Islands. In the music video for his song <!--del_lnk--> Replay he had the flag of the British Virgin Islands in the background.</p>
