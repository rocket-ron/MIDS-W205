       <p><b>Buddhist art</b> originated on the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent following the historical life of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Siddhartha Gautama">Siddhartha Gautama</a>, 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.</p>
       <p>Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia and into <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century due in part to the vigorous expansion of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> alongside <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>.</p>

       <p>During the 2nd to 1st century BCE, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha&rsquo;s life and teachings. These took the form of votive tablets or <!--del_lnk--> friezes, usually in relation to the decoration of stupas. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist symbolism. This period <!--del_lnk--> may have been aniconic.</p>
       <p>This reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scene where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the <!--del_lnk--> Amaravati School (see: <!--del_lnk--> Mara's assault on the Buddha). It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Iconic_phase_.281st_century_AD_.E2.80.93_present.29">Iconic phase (1st century AD &ndash; present)</span></h2>
       <p>Anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha started to emerge from the 1st century AD in <!--del_lnk--> Northern India. The two main centers of creation have been identified as <!--del_lnk--> Gandhara in today&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> North West Frontier Province, in <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and the region of <!--del_lnk--> Mathura, in central northern India.</p>
       <p>The art of Gandhara benefited from centuries of interaction with Greek culture since the conquests of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> in 332 BC and the subsequent establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrian and <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Greek Kingdoms, leading to the development of <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Buddhist art. Gandharan Buddhist sculpture displays <!--del_lnk--> Greek artistic influence, and it has been suggested that the concept of the "man-god" was essentially inspired by <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythological</a> culture. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.</p>
       <p>The art of Mathura tends to be based on a strong Indian tradition, exemplified by the anthropomorphic representation of divinities such as the <!--del_lnk--> Yaksas, although in a style rather archaic compared to the later representations of the Buddha. The Mathuran school contributed clothes covering the left shoulder of thin <!--del_lnk--> muslin, the wheel on the palm, the lotus seat, etc.</p>
       <p>Mathura and Gandhara also strongly influenced each other. During their artistic florescence, the two regions were even united politically under the <!--del_lnk--> Kushans, both being capitals of the empire. It is still a matter of debate whether the anthropomorphic representations of Buddha was essentially a result of a local evolution of Buddhist art at Mathura, or a consequence of Greek cultural influence in Gandhara through the <a href="../../wp/g/Greco-Buddhism.htm" title="Greco-Buddhism">Greco-Buddhist</a> <!--del_lnk--> syncretism.</p>

       <p>This iconic art was characterized from the start by a realistic idealism, combining realistic human features, proportions, attitudes and attributes, together with a sense of perfection and serenity reaching to the divine. This expression of the Buddha as both man and God became the iconographic canon for subsequent Buddhist art.</p>
       <p>Buddhist art continued to develop in India for a few more centuries. The pink <!--del_lnk--> sandstone sculptures of Mathura evolved during the <!--del_lnk--> Gupta period (4th to 6th century) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. The art of the Gupta school was extremely influential almost everywhere in the rest of Asia. By the 10th century, Buddhist art creation was <!--del_lnk--> dying out in India, as <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> ultimately prevailed.</p>
       <p>As Buddhism expanded outside of India from the 1st century AD, its original artistic package blended with other artistic influences, leading to a progressive differentiation among the countries adopting the faith.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road transmission of Buddhism to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Ming (58-75 AD). However, extensive contacts started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the <!--del_lnk--> Kushan Empire into the Chinese territory of the <!--del_lnk--> Tarim Basin, with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, such as <!--del_lnk--> Lokaksema, were either <!--del_lnk--> Parthian, <!--del_lnk--> Kushan, <!--del_lnk--> Sogdian or <!--del_lnk--> Kuchean.</p>
       <p>Central Asian missionary efforts along the <a href="../../wp/s/Silk_Road.htm" title="Silk Road">Silk Road</a> were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of <!--del_lnk--> Serindian art from the 2nd through the 11th century AD in the Tarim Basin, modern <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang. Serindian art often derives from the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Buddhist art of the <!--del_lnk--> Gandhara district of what is now <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, combining Indian, Greek and <!--del_lnk--> Roman influences. Silk Road Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs, Buddhist imagery, and a select few representations of <!--del_lnk--> Japanese gods.</p>
       <p>The art of the northern route was also highly influenced by the development of <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional <!--del_lnk--> &#x101;gamas, and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na goes beyond the traditional <!--del_lnk--> Early Buddhist ideal of the release from suffering (<!--del_lnk--> du&#x1E25;kha) of <!--del_lnk--> arhats, and emphasizes the <!--del_lnk--> bodhisattva path. The Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na sutras elevate the Buddha to a transcendent and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the <!--del_lnk--> Six Perfections, ultimate knowledge (<!--del_lnk--> Praj&ntilde;&#x101;p&#x101;ramit&#x101;), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhahood.htm" title="Buddhahood">buddhas</a>, bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings (<!--del_lnk--> devas).</p>

       <p>Buddhist art in <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> (old <!--del_lnk--> Bactria) persisted for several centuries until the spread of Islam in the 7th century. It is exemplified by the <!--del_lnk--> Buddhas of Bamyan. Other sculptures, in <!--del_lnk--> stucco, <!--del_lnk--> schist or <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clay</a>, display very strong blending of Indian post-<!--del_lnk--> Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic or possibly even <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Roman.</p>
       <p>Although Islamic rule was somewhat tolerant of other religions "<!--del_lnk--> of the Book", it showed little tolerance for Buddhism, which was perceived as a religion depending on "<!--del_lnk--> idolatry". Human figurative art forms also being prohibited under Islam, Buddhist art suffered numerous attacks, which culminated with the systematic destructions by the <!--del_lnk--> Taliban regime. The Buddhas of Bamyan, the sculptures of <!--del_lnk--> Hadda, and many of the remaining artifacts at the Afghanistan museum have been destroyed.</p>
       <p>The multiple conflicts since the 1980s also have led to a systematic pillage of archaeological sites apparently in the hope of reselling in the international market what artifacts could be found.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Central_Asia">Central Asia</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Central Asia long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Persia</a>. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the <!--del_lnk--> Former Han to the West led to increased contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrian Kingdom.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the North led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some <a href="../../wp/s/Silk_Road.htm" title="Silk Road">Silk Road</a> cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.</p>
       <p>The eastern part of Central Asia (<!--del_lnk--> Chinese Turkestan (<!--del_lnk--> Tarim Basin, <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang) in particular has revealed an extremely rich <!--del_lnk--> Serindian art (<!--del_lnk--> wall paintings and <!--del_lnk--> reliefs in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Works of art reminiscent of the Gandharan style, as well as scriptures in the Gandhari script <!--del_lnk--> Kharoshti have been found. These influences were rapidly absorbed however by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.</p>

       <p>Buddhism arrived in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> around the 1st century AD, and introduced new types of art into China, particularly in the area of <!--del_lnk--> statuary.

       <p>In the 5th to 6th centuries, the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Dynasties, developed rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible and realistic manner, progressively led to a change towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.</p>

       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tang_Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</span></h4>
       <p>Following a transition under the <!--del_lnk--> Sui Dynasty, Buddhist sculpture of the <a href="../../wp/t/Tang_Dynasty.htm" title="Tang Dynasty">Tang</a> evolved towards a markedly life-like expression. Because of the dynasty&rsquo;s openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Indian art of the Gupta period. During that time, the Tang capital of <!--del_lnk--> Chang'an (today's <!--del_lnk--> Xi'an) became an important centre for Buddhism. From there Buddhism spread to <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a>, and Japanese embassies of Kentoshi from Korea helped it gain a foothold in Japan.</p>

       </div>
       <p>However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor <!--del_lnk--> Wuzong outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian <!--del_lnk--> Nestorianism, <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism and <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>) in order to support the indigenous religion, <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>. He confiscated Buddhist possessions, and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the development of the religion and its arts in China.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Ch&aacute;n Buddhism however, as the origin of Japanese <!--del_lnk--> Zen, continued to prosper for some centuries, especially under the <a href="../../wp/s/Song_Dynasty.htm" title="Song Dynasty">Song Dynasty</a> (960-1279), when Chan monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.</p>

       <p><a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korean</a> Buddhist art generally reflects an interaction between other Buddhist influences and a strongly original Korean culture. Additionally, the art of the steppes, particularly Siberian and <!--del_lnk--> Scythian influences, are evident in early Korean Buddhist art based on the excavation of artifacts and burial goods such as <!--del_lnk--> Silla <!--del_lnk--> royal crowns, belt buckles, daggers, and comma-shaped <!--del_lnk--> gogok. The style of this indigenous art was geometric, abstract and richly adorned with a characteristic "barbarian" luxury. Although many other influences were strong, Korean Buddhist art, "bespeaks a sobriety, taste for the right tone, a sense of abstraction but also of colours that curiously enough are in line with contemporary taste" (Pierre Cambon, <i>Arts asiatiques- Guimet'</i>).</p>

       <p>The first of the <!--del_lnk--> Three Kingdoms of Korea to officially receive Buddhism was <!--del_lnk--> Goguryeo in 372. However, Chinese records and the use of Buddhist motifs in Goguryeo murals indicate the introduction of Buddhism earlier than the official date. The <!--del_lnk--> Baekje Kingdom officially recognized Buddhism in 384. The <!--del_lnk--> Silla Kingdom, isolated and with no easy sea or land access to China, officially adopted Buddhism in 535 although the foreign religion was known in the kingdom due to the work of Goguryeo monks since the early fifth century. The introduction of Buddhism stimulated the need for artisans to create images for veneration, architects for temples, and the literate for the Buddhist sutras and transformed Korean civilization. Particularly important in the transmission of sophisticated art styles to the Korean kingdoms was the art of the "barbarian" Tuoba, a clan of non-Han Chinese Xianbei people who established the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Wei Dynasty in China in 386. The Northern Wei style was particularly influential in the art of the Goguryeo and Baekje. Baekje artisans later transmitted this style along with Southern Dynasty elements and distinct Korean elements to Japan. Korean artisans were highly selective of the styles they incorporated and combined different regional styles together to create a specific Korean Buddhist art style.</p>

       <p>While Goguryeo Buddhist art exhibited vitality and mobility akin with Northern Wei prototypes, the Baekje Kingdom was also in close contact with the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Dynasties of China and this close diplomatic contact is exemplified in the gentle and proportional sculpture of the Baekje, epitomized by Baekje sculpture exhibiting the fathomless smile known to art historians as the <!--del_lnk--> Baekje smile. The Silla Kingdom also developed a distinctive Buddhist art tradition epitomized by the <!--del_lnk--> Bangasayusang, a half-seated contemplative maitreya whose Korean-made twin, the Miroku Bosatsu, was sent to Japan as a proselytizing gift and now resides in the Koryu-ji Temple in Japan. Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms period stimulated massive temple-building projects, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Mireuksa Temple in the Baekje Kingdom and the <!--del_lnk--> Hwangnyongsa Temple in Silla. Baekje architects were famed for their skill and were instrumental in building the massive nine-story pagoda at Hwangnyongsa and early Buddhist temples in Yamato Japan such as <!--del_lnk--> H&#x14D;k&#x14D;-ji (Asuka-dera) and <!--del_lnk--> H&#x14D;ry&#x16B;-ji. Sixth century Korean Buddhist art exhibited the cultural influences of China and India but began to show distinctive indigenous characteristics. These indigenous characteristics can be seen in early Buddhist art in Japan and some early Japanese Buddhist sculpture is now believed to have originated in Korea, particularly from Baekje, or Korean artisans who immigrated to Yamato Japan. Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Korean style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Koryu-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chugu-ji Siddhartha statues. Although many historians portray Korea as a mere transmitter of Buddhism, the Three Kingdoms, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.</p>

       <p>Before the introduction of Buddhism, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> had already been the seat of various cultural (and artistic) influences, from the abstract linear decorative art of the indigenous Neolithic <!--del_lnk--> J&#x14D;mon from around 10500 BC to 300 BC, to the art during the <!--del_lnk--> Yayoi and <!--del_lnk--> Kofun periods, with developments such as <!--del_lnk--> Haniwa art.</p>
       <p>The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century. Being geographically at the end of the <a href="../../wp/s/Silk_Road.htm" title="Silk Road">Silk Road</a>, Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.</p>

       <p>From 711, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of <!--del_lnk--> Nara, including a five-story <!--del_lnk--> pagoda, the Golden Hall of the Horyuji, and the <!--del_lnk--> K&#x14D;fuku-ji temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. Indian, Hellenistic, Chinese and Korean artistic influences blended into an original style characterized by realism and gracefulness. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during the periods of <!--del_lnk--> Nara, <!--del_lnk--> Heian and <!--del_lnk--> Kamakura. Japan developed an extremely rich figurative art for the pantheon of Buddhist deities, sometimes combined with <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Shinto.htm" title="Shinto">Shinto</a> influences. This art can be very varied, creative and bold.</p>
       <p>From the 12th and 13th, a further development was <!--del_lnk--> Zen art, following the introduction of the faith by <!--del_lnk--> Dogen and <!--del_lnk--> Eisai upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as <!--del_lnk--> sumi-e) and poetry (especially <a href="../../wp/h/Haiku.htm" title="Haiku">haikus</a>), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the <!--del_lnk--> Chanoyu tea ceremony or the <!--del_lnk--> Ikebana art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques (<!--del_lnk--> martial arts).</p>
       <p>Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Still around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved. Many of them are in wood and are regularly restored.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Tantric Buddhism started as a movement in eastern India around the 5th or the 6th century. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are derived from <!--del_lnk--> Brahmanism (the usage of <!--del_lnk--> mantras, <!--del_lnk--> yoga, or the burning of sacrificial offerings). Tantrism became the dominant form of Buddhism in <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> from the 8th century. Due to its geographical centrality in Asia, Tibetan Buddhist art received influence from Indian, <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepali</a>, Greco-Buddhist and Chinese art.</p>
       <p>One of the most characteristic creations of Tibetan Buddhist art are the <!--del_lnk--> mandalas, diagrams of a "divine temple" made of a circle enclosing a square, the purpose of which is to help Buddhist devotees focus their attention through meditation and follow the path to the central image of the Buddha. Artistically, Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> Gupta art and Hindu art tend to be the two strongest inspirations of Tibetan art.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vietnam">Vietnam</span></h3>
       <p>Chinese influence was predominant in the north of <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> (Tonkin) between the 1st and 9th centuries, and <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and Mahayana Buddhism were prevalent.

       <p>In the south thrived the former kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Champa (before it was later overtaken by the Vietnamese from the north). <!--del_lnk--> Champa had a strongly Indianized art, just as neighboring <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>.

       <p>For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The <!--del_lnk--> Pali and <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> languages and the Indian script, together with <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana and <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhism, <!--del_lnk--> Brahmanism and <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the <a href="../../wp/r/Ramayana.htm" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> and the <a href="../../wp/m/Mahabharata.htm" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>. This expansion provided the artistic context for the development of Buddhist art in these countries, which then developed characteristics of their own.</p>
       <p>Between the 1st and 8th centuries, several kingdoms competed for influence in the region (particularly the Cambodian <!--del_lnk--> Funan then the Burmese <!--del_lnk--> Mon kingdoms) contributing various artistic characteristics, mainly derived from the Indian <!--del_lnk--> Gupta style. Combined with a pervading Hindu influence, Buddhist images, votive tablets and Sanskrit inscriptions are found throughout the area.</p>
       <p>From the 9th to the 13th centuries, Southeast Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The <!--del_lnk--> Sri Vijaya Empire to the south and the <!--del_lnk--> Khmer Empire to the north competed for influence, but both were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the <!--del_lnk--> Bodhisattvas. The <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhism of the Pali canon was introduced to the region around the 13th century from <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, and was adopted by the newly founded <!--del_lnk--> ethnic Thai kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Sukhothai. Since in Theravada Buddhism only monks can reach <!--del_lnk--> Nirvana, the construction of <b>temple complexes</b> plays a particularly important role in the artistic expression of Southeast Asia from that time.</p>
       <p>From the 14th century, the main factor was the spread of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> to the maritime areas of Southeast Asia, overrunning <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, and most of the islands as far as the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>.

       <p>A neighbour of India, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Burma.htm" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> (Burma) was naturally strongly influenced by the eastern part of Indian territory. The <!--del_lnk--> Mon of southern Burma are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200 BC under the proselytizing of the Indian king <!--del_lnk--> Ashoka, before the schism between <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana and <!--del_lnk--> Hinayana Buddhism.</p>
       <p>Early Buddhist temples are found, such as Beikthano in central Myanmar, with dates between the 1st and the 5th centuries. The Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the <!--del_lnk--> Gupta and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in Southeast Asia following the expansion of the Mon Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries.</p>
       <p>Later, thousands of Buddhist temples were built at <!--del_lnk--> Bagan, the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 of them are still standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite the seizure of the city by the <!--del_lnk--> Mongols in 1287.</p>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Ava period, from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, the Ava (Innwa) style of the Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa <!--del_lnk--> mudra.</p>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Konbaung dynasty, at the end of the eighteenth century, the Mandalay style of the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day. There was a marked departure from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing or sitting. Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.</p>
       <p>Another common style of Buddha images is the Shan style, from the <!--del_lnk--> Shan people, who inhabit the highlands of Myanmar. In this style, the Buddha is depicted with angular features, a large and prominently pointed nose, a hair bun tied similar to Thai styles, and a small, thin mouth.</p>

       <p>Extremely rich and refined architectural remains are found in Java and Sumatra. The most magnificent is the temple of <!--del_lnk--> Borobudur (the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built around 780-850 AD). This temple is modelled after the Buddhist concept of universe, the <!--del_lnk--> Mandala which counts 505 images of the seated Buddha and unique bell-shaped stupa that contains the statue of Buddha. Borobudur is adorned with long series of bas-reliefs narrated the holy Buddhist scriptures. The oldest Buddhist structure in Indonesia probably is the <!--del_lnk--> Batujaya stupas at Karawang, West Java, dated from around 4th century CE. This temple is some plastered brick stupas. However, Buddhist art in Indonesia reach the golden era during the <!--del_lnk--> Sailendra dynasty rule in Java. The bas-reliefs and statues of <!--del_lnk--> Boddhisatva, <!--del_lnk--> Tara, and <!--del_lnk--> Kinnara found in <!--del_lnk--> Kalasan, <!--del_lnk--> Sewu, <!--del_lnk--> Sari, and <!--del_lnk--> Plaosan temple is very graceful with serene expression, While Mendut temple near Borobudur, houses the giant statue of <!--del_lnk--> Vairocana, <!--del_lnk--> Avalokitesvara, and <!--del_lnk--> Vajrapani.</p>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> Sri Vijaya probably built the temple of Muara Takus, and <!--del_lnk--> Muaro Jambi. The most beautiful example of classical Javanese Buddhist art is the serene and delicate statue of <!--del_lnk--> Prajnaparamita (the collection of National Museum Jakarta) the goddess of transcendental wisdom from <!--del_lnk--> Singhasari kingdom. The Indonesian Buddhist Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Chola_dynasty.htm" title="Chola">Chola</a> rulers of India, then followed by <!--del_lnk--> Majapahit empire, before being destabilized by the Islamic expansion from the 13th century.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Contemporary_Buddhist_art">Contemporary Buddhist art</span></h2>
       <p>Many contemporary artists have made use of Buddhist themes. Notable examples are <!--del_lnk--> Bill Viola, in his video installations, <!--del_lnk--> John Connell, in sculpture., and <!--del_lnk--> Allan Graham in his multi-media &ldquo;Time is Memory&rdquo;.</p>
       <p>In the UK <!--del_lnk--> The Network of Buddhist Organisations has interested itself in identifying Buddhist practitioners across all the arts. In 2005 it co-ordinated the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, "A Lotus in Flower"; in 2009 it helped organise the two-day arts conference, "Buddha Mind, Creative Mind". As a result of the latter an association of Buddhist artists was formed.</p>
