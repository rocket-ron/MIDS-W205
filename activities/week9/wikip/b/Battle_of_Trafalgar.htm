       <p>The <b>Battle of Trafalgar</b> (21 October 1805) was a <!--del_lnk--> naval engagement fought by the British <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> against the combined fleets of the <!--del_lnk--> French Navy and <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Navy, during the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Third Coalition (August&ndash;December 1805) of the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> (1803&ndash;1815).</p>
       <p>The battle was the most decisive British naval victory of the war. Twenty-seven British <!--del_lnk--> ships of the line led by <a href="../../wp/h/Horatio_Nelson%252C_1st_Viscount_Nelson.htm" title="Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson">Admiral Lord Nelson</a> aboard <!--del_lnk--> HMS&nbsp;<i>Victory</i> defeated thirty-three French and Spanish ships of the line under French Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Pierre-Charles Villeneuve off the south-west coast of Spain, just west of <!--del_lnk--> Cape Trafalgar. The Franco-Spanish fleet lost twenty-two ships, without a single British vessel being lost.</p>
       <p>The British victory spectacularly confirmed the naval supremacy that Britain had established during the previous century and was achieved in part through Nelson's departure from the prevailing naval tactical orthodoxy, which involved engaging an enemy fleet in a single line of battle parallel to the enemy to facilitate signalling in battle and disengagement, and to maximise fields of fire and target areas. Nelson instead divided his smaller force into two columns directed perpendicularly against the larger enemy fleet, with decisive results.</p>
       <p>Nelson was mortally wounded during the battle, becoming one of Britain's greatest war heroes. The commander of the joint French and Spanish forces, Admiral Villeneuve, was captured along with his ship <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bucentaure</i>. Spanish Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Federico Gravina escaped with the remnant of the fleet and succumbed months later to wounds sustained during the battle.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h2>
       <p>In 1805, the <!--del_lnk--> First French Empire, under <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Napoleon.htm" title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, was the dominant military land power on the European continent, while the British <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> controlled the seas. During the course of the war, the British imposed a naval <!--del_lnk--> blockade on France, which affected trade and kept the French from fully mobilising their own naval resources. Despite several successful evasions of the blockade by the French navy, it failed to inflict a major defeat upon the British. The British were able to attack French interests at home and abroad with relative ease.</p>
       <p>When the <!--del_lnk--> Third Coalition declared war on France, after the short-lived <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Amiens, Napoleon was determined to invade Britain. To do so, he needed to ensure that the Royal Navy would be unable to disrupt the invasion <!--del_lnk--> flotilla, which would require control of the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">English Channel</a>.</p>
       <p>The main French <!--del_lnk--> fleets were at <!--del_lnk--> Brest in <!--del_lnk--> Brittany and at <!--del_lnk--> Toulon on the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> coast. Other ports on the French Atlantic coast harboured smaller <!--del_lnk--> squadrons. France and Spain were allied, so the Spanish fleet based in <!--del_lnk--> Cadiz and <!--del_lnk--> Ferrol was also available.</p>
       <p>The British possessed an experienced and well-trained corps of naval officers. By contrast, most of the best officers in the French navy had been either executed or dismissed from the service during the early part of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. As a result, Vice-Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Pierre-Charles Villeneuve was the most competent senior officer available to command Napoleon's Mediterranean fleet. However, Villeneuve had shown a distinct lack of enthusiasm for facing Nelson and the Royal Navy after the defeat at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Nile in 1798.</p>
       <p>Napoleon's naval plan in 1805 was for the French and Spanish fleets in the Mediterranean and Cadiz to break through the <!--del_lnk--> blockade and join forces in the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean. They would then return, assist the fleet in Brest to emerge from the blockade, and together clear the English Channel of Royal Navy ships, ensuring a safe passage for the invasion barges.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Caribbean">The Caribbean</span></h3>
       <p>Early in 1805, Admiral Lord Nelson commanded the British fleet blockading Toulon. Unlike <!--del_lnk--> William Cornwallis, who maintained a tight blockade of Brest with the Channel Fleet, Nelson adopted a loose blockade in hopes of luring the French out for a major battle. However, Villeneuve's fleet successfully evaded Nelson's when the British were blown off station by storms. While Nelson was searching the Mediterranean for him, erroneously supposing that Villeneuve intended to make for <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, Villeneuve passed through the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Gibraltar, rendezvoused with the Spanish fleet, and sailed as planned to the Caribbean. Once Nelson realised that the French had crossed into the Atlantic Ocean, he set off in pursuit.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="C.C3.A1diz">C&aacute;diz</span></h3>
       <p>Villeneuve returned from the Caribbean to Europe, intending to break the blockade at Brest, but after two of his Spanish ships were captured during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Cape Finisterre by a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir <!--del_lnk--> Robert Calder, Villeneuve abandoned this plan and sailed back to <!--del_lnk--> Ferrol. There he received orders from Napoleon to resume to Brest according to the main plan.</p>
       <p>Napoleon's invasion plans for England depended entirely on having a sufficiently large number of ships of the line before <!--del_lnk--> Boulogne, France. This would require Villeneuve's force of 33 ships to join Vice-Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Ganteaume's force of 21 ships at Brest, along with a squadron of 5 ships under Captain Allemand, which would have given him a combined force of 59 ships of the line.</p>
       <p>When Villeneuve set sail from Ferrol on 10 August, he was under orders from Napoleon to sail northward toward Brest. Instead, he worried that the British were observing his manoeuvres, so on 11 August he sailed southward towards Cadiz on the southwestern coast of Spain. With no sign of Villeneuve's fleet by 26 August, the three French army corps' invasion force near <!--del_lnk--> Boulogne broke camp and marched to Germany, where it was later engaged.</p>
       <p>The same month, Nelson returned home to England after two years of duty at sea, for some rest. He remained ashore for 25&nbsp;days, and was warmly received by his countrymen, who were nervous about a possible French invasion. Word reached England on 2 September about the combined French and Spanish fleet in the harbour of Cadiz. Nelson had to wait until 15 September before his ship <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Victory</i> was ready to sail.</p>
       <p>On 15 August, Cornwallis decided to detach 20 ships of the line from the fleet guarding the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">Channel</a> and to have them sail southward to engage the enemy forces in Spain. This left the Channel denuded of ships, with only 11 ships of the line present. However, this detached force formed the nucleus of the British fleet that would fight at Trafalgar. This fleet, under the command of Vice-Admiral Calder, reached Cadiz on 15 September. Nelson joined the fleet on 29 September to take command.</p>
       <p>The British fleet used <!--del_lnk--> frigates to keep a constant watch on the harbour, while the main force remained out of sight 50&nbsp;miles (80&nbsp;km) west of the shore. Nelson's hope was to lure the combined Franco-Spanish force out and engage them in a "pell-mell battle". The force watching the harbour was led by Captain Blackwood, commanding <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Euryalus</i>. He was brought up to a strength of seven ships (five frigates and two schooners) on 8 October.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Supply_situation">Supply situation</span></h3>
       <p>At this point, Nelson's fleet badly needed provisioning. On 2 October, five ships of the line, <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Queen</i>, <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Canopus</i>, <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Spencer</i>, <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Zealous</i>, <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Tigre</i>, and the frigate <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Endymion</i> were dispatched to <a href="../../wp/g/Gibraltar.htm" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> under <!--del_lnk--> Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis for supplies. These ships were later diverted for convoy duty in the Mediterranean, though Nelson had expected them to return. Other British ships continued to arrive, and by 15 October the fleet was up to full strength for the battle. Nelson also lost Calder's <!--del_lnk--> flagship, the 98-gun <!--del_lnk--> <i>Prince of Wales</i>, which he sent home as Calder had been recalled by the Admiralty to face a court martial for his apparent lack of aggression during the engagement off Cape Finisterre on 22 July.</p>
       <p>Meanwhile, Villeneuve's fleet in Cadiz was also suffering from a serious supply shortage that could not be readily rectified by the cash-strapped French. The blockades maintained by the British fleet had made it difficult for the allies to obtain stores and their ships were ill fitted. Villeneuve's ships were also more than two thousand men short of the force needed to sail. These were not the only problems faced by the Franco-Spanish fleet. The main French ships of the line had been kept in harbour for years by the British blockades with only brief sorties. The French crews contained few experienced sailors, and, as most of the crew had to be taught the elements of seamanship on the few occasions when they got to sea, gunnery was neglected. The hasty voyage across the Atlantic and back used up vital supplies. Villeneuve's supply situation began to improve in October, but news of Nelson's arrival made Villeneuve reluctant to leave port. Indeed, his captains had held a vote on the matter and decided to stay in the harbour.</p>
       <p>On 16 September, Napoleon gave orders for the French and Spanish ships at Cadiz to put to sea at the first favourable opportunity, join with seven Spanish ships of the line then at <!--del_lnk--> Cartagena, go to <!--del_lnk--> Naples and land the soldiers they carried to reinforce his troops there, and fight with decisive action if they met a British fleet of inferior numbers.</p>

       <p>On 21 October, Admiral Nelson had 27 ships-of-the-line. His <!--del_lnk--> flagship, <!--del_lnk--> HMS&nbsp;<i>Victory</i>, was one of three 100-gun <!--del_lnk--> first rates in his fleet. He also had four 98-gun <!--del_lnk--> second rates and twenty <!--del_lnk--> third rates. One of the third rates was an 80-gun vessel and sixteen were 74-gun vessels. The remaining three were 64-gun ships, which were being phased out of the Royal Navy at the time of the battle. Nelson also had four <!--del_lnk--> frigates of 38 or 36 guns, a 12-gun <!--del_lnk--> schooner and a 10-gun <!--del_lnk--> cutter.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Franco-Spanish">Franco-Spanish</span></h3>
       <p>Against Nelson, Vice-Admiral Villeneuve fielded 33 <!--del_lnk--> ships-of-the-line, including some of the largest in the world at the time. The Spanish contributed four first-rates to the fleet. Three of these ships, one at 136 guns (<!--del_lnk--> Santisima Trinidad) and two at 112 guns (Principe de Asturias, Santa Anna), were much larger than anything under Nelson's command. The fourth first-rate carried 100 guns. The fleet had six 80-gun third-rates, (four French and two Spanish), and one French 64-gun third-rate. The remaining 22 third-rates were 74-gun vessels, of which fourteen were French and eight Spanish. In total the Spanish contributed 15 ships of the line and the French 18. The fleet also included five 40-gun frigates and two 18-gun <!--del_lnk--> brigs, all French.</p>

       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Nelson.27s_plan">Nelson's plan</span></h3>
       <p>The prevailing <!--del_lnk--> tactical orthodoxy at the time involved manoeuvring to approach the enemy fleet in a single <!--del_lnk--> line of battle and then engaging in parallel lines. Before this time the fleets had usually been involved in a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e with the fleets becoming mixed together. One of the reasons for the development of the line of battle was to help the admiral control the fleet. If all the ships were in line, signalling in battle became possible. The line also had defensive properties, allowing either side to disengage by breaking away in formation. If the attacker chose to continue combat their line would be broken as well. Often this latter tactic led to inconclusive battles or allowed the losing side to reduce its losses. Nelson wished to see a conclusive battle.</p>
       <p>His solution to the problem was to deliberately cut the opposing line in three. Approaching in two columns sailing perpendicular to the enemy's line, one towards the centre of the opposing line and one towards the trailing end, his ships would break the enemy formation into three, surround one third, and force them to fight to the end. Nelson hoped specifically to cut the line just in front of the <!--del_lnk--> flagship; the isolated ships in front of the break would not be able to see the flagship's signals, hopefully taking them out of combat while they reformed. The intention of going straight at the enemy echoed the <!--del_lnk--> tactics used by <!--del_lnk--> Admiral Duncan at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Camperdown and <!--del_lnk--> Admiral Jervis at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Cape St Vincent, both in 1797.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The plan had three principal advantages. First, it would allow the British fleet to close with the Franco-Spanish fleet as quickly as possible, reducing the chance that it would be able to escape without fighting. Second, it would quickly bring on a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e and frantic battle by breaking the Franco-Spanish line and inducing a series of individual ship-to-ship fights, in which the British were likely to prevail. Nelson knew that the better seamanship, faster gunnery, and higher morale of his crews were great advantages. Third, it would bring a decisive concentration on the rear of the Franco-Spanish fleet. The ships in the van of the enemy fleet would have to turn back to support the rear, and this would take a long time. Additionally, once the Franco-Spanish line had been broken, their ships would be relatively defenceless to powerful broadsides from the British fleet, and would take a long time to reposition to return fire.</p>
       <p>The main drawback of attacking head on was that as the leading British ships approached, the Franco-Spanish ships would be able to direct at their bows a <!--del_lnk--> raking <!--del_lnk--> broadside fire to which they would be unable to reply. In order to lessen the time the fleet was exposed to this danger, Nelson had his ships make all available sail (including <!--del_lnk--> stuns'ls). This was yet another departure from the norm. Nelson was also well aware that French and Spanish gunners were ill-trained, would probably be supplemented with soldiers, and would have difficulty firing accurately from a moving gun platform. The Combined Fleet was sailing across a heavy swell, causing the ships to roll heavily and exacerbating these problems. Nelson's plan was indeed a gamble, but a carefully calculated one.</p>
       <p>During the period of <!--del_lnk--> blockade off the coast of Spain in October, Nelson instructed his captains, over two dinners aboard <i>Victory</i>, on his plan for the approaching battle. The order of sailing, in which the fleet was arranged when the enemy was first sighted, was to be the order of ensuing battle, so that no time would be wasted in forming a precise line. The attack was to be made in two bodies; one led by his second in command, <!--del_lnk--> Collingwood, was to throw itself on the rear of the enemy, while the other, led by Nelson, was to take care of the centre and vanguard. In preparation for the battle, Nelson ordered the ships of his fleet painted in a distinctive yellow and black pattern (later known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Nelson Chequer</i>) that would make them easy to distinguish from their opponents.</p>
       <p>Nelson was careful to point out that something had to be left to chance. Nothing is sure in a sea fight, and he left his captains free from all hampering rules by telling them that "No captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy." In short, circumstances would dictate the execution, subject to the guiding rule that the enemy's rear was to be cut off and superior force concentrated on that part of the enemy's line.</p>
       <p>Admiral Villeneuve himself expressed his belief that Nelson would use some sort of unorthodox attack, stating specifically that he believed he would drive right at his lines. But his long game of <i><!--del_lnk--> cat and mouse</i> with Nelson had worn him down, and he was suffering from a loss of nerve. Arguing that the inexperience of his officers meant he would not be able to maintain formation in more than one group, he chose not to act on his accurate assessment of Nelson's intentions.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Departure">Departure</span></h3>
       <p>The Combined Fleet of French and Spanish warships anchored in Cadiz and under the leadership of Admiral Villeneuve was in disarray. On 16 September 1805 Villeneuve received orders from <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Napoleon.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon</a> to sail the Combined Fleet from Cadiz to <!--del_lnk--> Naples. At first Villeneuve was optimistic about returning to the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> but soon had second thoughts. A war council was held aboard his flagship, <i><!--del_lnk--> Bucentaure</i>, on 8 October. While some of the French captains wished to obey Napoleon's orders, the Spanish captains and other French officers, including Villeneuve, thought it best to remain in Cadiz. Villeneuve changed his mind yet again on 18 October 1805, ordering the Combined Fleet to sail immediately even though there were only very light winds.</p>
       <p>The sudden change was prompted by a letter Villeneuve had received on 18 October, informing him that Vice-Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Fran&ccedil;ois Rosily had arrived in <a href="../../wp/m/Madrid.htm" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> with orders to take command of the Combined Fleet. Stung by the prospect of being disgraced before the fleet, Villeneuve resolved to go to sea before his successor could reach Cadiz. At the same time, he received intelligence that a detachment of six British ships (<!--del_lnk--> Admiral Louis' squadron) had docked at <a href="../../wp/g/Gibraltar.htm" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, thus weakening the British fleet. This was used as the pretext for sudden change.</p>
       <p>The weather, however, suddenly turned calm following a week of gales. This slowed the progress of the fleet leaving the harbour, giving the British plenty of warning. Villeneuve had drawn up plans to form a force of four squadrons, each containing both French and Spanish ships. Following their earlier vote on 8 October to stay put, some captains were reluctant to leave Cadiz and as a result they failed to follow Villeneuve's orders closely and the fleet straggled out of the harbour in no particular formation.</p>
       <p>It took most of 20 October for Villeneuve to get his fleet organised, and it set sail in three columns for the Straits of Gibraltar to the southeast. That same evening, <i><!--del_lnk--> Achille</i> spotted a force of 18 British ships of the line in pursuit. The fleet began to prepare for battle and during the night, they were ordered into a single line. The following day, Nelson's fleet of 27 ships of the line and four frigates was spotted in pursuit from the northwest with the wind behind it. Villeneuve again ordered his fleet into three columns, but soon changed his mind and ordered a single line. The result was a sprawling, uneven formation.</p>

       <p>The British fleet was sailing, as they would fight, under signal 72 hoisted on Nelson's flagship. At 5:40&nbsp;a.m., the British were about 21&nbsp;miles (34&nbsp;km) to the northwest of Cape Trafalgar, with the Franco-Spanish fleet between the British and the Cape. At 6&nbsp;a.m. that morning, Nelson gave the order to prepare for battle.</p>
       <p>At 8&nbsp;a.m., Villeneuve ordered the fleet to <i>wear together</i> and turn back for Cadiz. This reversed the order of the Allied line, placing the rear division under Rear-Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley in the vanguard. The wind became contrary at this point, often shifting direction. The very light wind rendered manoeuvering virtually impossible for all but the most expert crews. The inexperienced crews had difficulty with the changing conditions, and it took nearly an hour and a half for Villeneuve's order to be completed. The French and Spanish fleet now formed an uneven, angular crescent, with the slower ships generally <!--del_lnk--> leeward and closer to the shore.</p>
       <p>By 11&nbsp;a.m. Nelson's entire fleet was visible to Villeneuve, drawn up in two parallel columns. The two fleets would be within range of each other within an hour. Villeneuve was concerned at this point about forming up a line, as his ships were unevenly spaced and in an irregular formation. The Franco-Spanish fleet was drawn out nearly five miles (8&nbsp;km) long as Nelson's fleet approached.</p>
       <p>As the British drew closer, they could see that the enemy was not sailing in a tight order, but rather in irregular groups. Nelson could not immediately make out the French flagship as the French and Spanish were not flying command pennants.</p>
       <p>Nelson was outnumbered and outgunned, the enemy totalling nearly 30,000 men and 2,568 guns to his 17,000 men and 2,148 guns. The Franco-Spanish fleet also had six more ships of the line, and so could more readily combine their fire. There was no way for some of Nelson's ships to avoid being "doubled on" or even "trebled on".</p>
       <p>As the two fleets drew closer, anxiety began to build among officers and sailors, one British sailor described the time before thus: "During this momentous preparation, the human mind had ample time for meditation, for it was evident that the fate of England rested on this battle".</p>

       <p>The battle progressed largely according to Nelson's plan.

       <p>The term England was widely used at the time to refer to the United Kingdom; the British fleet included significant contingents from Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Unlike the photographic depiction, this signal would have been shown on the <!--del_lnk--> mizzen mast only and would have required 12 'lifts'.</p>
       <p>As the battle opened, the French and Spanish were in a ragged curved line headed north. As planned, the British fleet was approaching the Franco-Spanish line in two columns. Leading the northern, <!--del_lnk--> windward column in <i>Victory</i> was Nelson, while Collingwood in the 100-gun <!--del_lnk--> <i>Royal Sovereign</i> led the second, leeward, column. The two British columns approached from the west at nearly a right angle to the allied line. Nelson led his column into a feint toward the van of the Franco-Spanish fleet and then abruptly turned toward the actual point of attack. Collingwood altered the course of his column slightly so that the two lines converged at this line of attack.</p>
       <p>Just before his column engaged the allied forces, Collingwood said to his officers, "Now, gentlemen, let us do something today which the world may talk of hereafter." Because the winds were very light during the battle, all the ships were moving extremely slowly, and the foremost British ships were under heavy fire from several of the allied ships for almost an hour before their own guns could bear.</p>
       <p>At noon, Villeneuve sent the signal "engage the enemy", and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Fougueux</i> fired her first trial shot at <i>Royal Sovereign</i>. <i>Royal Sovereign</i> had all sails out and, having recently had her bottom cleaned, outran the rest of the British fleet. As she approached the allied line, she came under fire from <i>Fougueux</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Indomptable</i>, <i>San Justo</i> and <i>San Leandro</i>, before breaking the line just astern of Admiral Alava's flagship <i><!--del_lnk--> Santa Ana</i>, into which she fired a devastating <!--del_lnk--> double-shotted <!--del_lnk--> raking <!--del_lnk--> broadside.</p>
       <p>The second ship in the British lee column, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Belleisle</i>, was engaged by <!--del_lnk--> <i>L'Aigle</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Achille</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Neptune</i> and <i>Fougueux</i>; she was soon completely dismasted, unable to manoeuvre and largely unable to fight, as her sails blinded her batteries, but kept flying her flag for 45&nbsp;minutes until the following British ships came to her rescue.</p>
       <p>For 40&nbsp;minutes, <i>Victory</i> was under fire from <!--del_lnk--> <i>H&eacute;ros</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Redoutable</i> and <i>Neptune</i>; although many shots went astray, others killed and wounded a number of her crew and shot away her wheel, so that she had to be steered from her tiller belowdecks. <i>Victory</i> could not yet respond. At 12:45, <i>Victory</i> cut the enemy line between Villeneuve's flagship <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bucentaure</i> and <i>Redoutable</i>. <i>Victory</i> came close to the <i>Bucentaure</i>, firing a devastating raking broadside through her stern which killed and wounded many on her gundecks. Villeneuve thought that boarding would take place, and with the Eagle of his ship in hand, told his men, "I will throw it onto the enemy ship and we will take it back there!" However Admiral Nelson of <i>Victory</i> engaged the 74 gun <i>Redoutable</i>. <i>Bucentaure</i> was left to be dealt with by the next three ships of the British windward column: <!--del_lnk--> <i>Temeraire</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Conqueror</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Neptune</i>.</p>

       <p>A general m&ecirc;l&eacute;e ensued and, during that fight, <i>Victory</i> locked masts with the French <i>Redoutable</i>. The crew of the <i>Redoutable</i>, which included a strong infantry corps (with three captains and four lieutenants), gathered for an attempt to board and seize the <i>Victory</i>. A <!--del_lnk--> musket bullet fired from the <!--del_lnk--> mizzentop of the <i>Redoutable</i> struck Nelson in the left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches below his right scapula in the muscles of his back. Nelson exclaimed, "They finally succeeded, I am dead." He was carried below decks.</p>
       <p><i>Victory</i> ceased fire, the gunners having been called on the deck to fight the capture, but were forced below decks by French <!--del_lnk--> grenades. As the French were preparing to board <i>Victory</i>, the <i>Temeraire</i>, the second ship in the British windward column, approached from the starboard bow of the <i>Redoutable</i> and fired on the exposed French crew with a <!--del_lnk--> carronade, causing many casualties.</p>
       <p>At 13:55, <!--del_lnk--> Captain Lucas, of the <i>Redoutable</i>, with 99 fit men out of 643 and severely wounded himself, surrendered. The French <i>Bucentaure</i> was isolated by the <i>Victory</i> and <i>Temeraire</i>, and then engaged by <i>Neptune</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Leviathan</i> and <i>Conqueror</i>; similarly, the <i>Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad</i> was isolated and overwhelmed, surrendering after three hours.</p>
       <p>As more and more British ships entered the battle, the ships of the allied centre and rear were gradually overwhelmed. The allied van, after long remaining quiescent, made a futile demonstration and then sailed away. The British took 22 vessels of the Franco-Spanish fleet and lost none. Among the taken French ships were the <!--del_lnk--> <i>L'Aigle</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Alg&eacute;siras</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Berwick</i>, <i>Bucentaure</i>, <i>Fougueux</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Intr&eacute;pide</i>, <i>Redoutable</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Swiftsure</i>. The Spanish ships taken were <i>Argonauta</i>, <i>Bahama</i>, <i>Monarca</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Neptuno</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>San Agust&iacute;n</i>, <i>San Ildefonso</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>San Juan Nepomuceno</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad</i>, and <i>Santa Ana</i>. Of these, <i>Redoutable</i> sank, <i>Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad</i> and <i>Argonauta</i> were scuttled by the British and later sank, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Achille</i> exploded, <i>Intr&eacute;pide</i> and <i>San August&iacute;n</i> burned, and <i>L'Aigle</i>, <i>Berwick</i>, <i>Fougueux</i>, and <i>Monarca</i> were wrecked in a gale following the battle.</p>

       <p>As Nelson lay dying, he ordered the fleet to anchor, as a storm was predicted. However, when the storm blew up, many of the severely damaged ships sank or ran aground on the <!--del_lnk--> shoals. A few of them were recaptured, some by the French and Spanish prisoners overcoming the small prize crews, others by ships sallying from Cadiz. Surgeon <!--del_lnk--> William Beatty heard Nelson murmur, "Thank God I have done my duty"; when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak. He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Nelson's chaplain, <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as "God and my country." It has been suggested by Nelson historian Craig Cabell that Nelson was actually reciting his own prayer as he fell into his death coma, as the words 'God' and 'my country' are closely linked therein. Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after being hit.</p>

       <p>Towards the end of the battle, and with the combined fleet being overwhelmed, the still relatively un-engaged portion of the van under Rear-Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Dumanoir Le Pelley tried to come to the assistance of the collapsing centre. After failing to fight his way through, he decided to break off the engagement, and led four French ships, his flagship the 80-gun <!--del_lnk--> <i>Formidable</i>, and the 74-gun ships <!--del_lnk--> <i>Scipion</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Duguay Trouin</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Mont Blanc</i> away from the fighting. He at first headed for the <!--del_lnk--> Straits of Gibraltar, intending to carry out Villeneuve's original orders, and make for <!--del_lnk--> Toulon. On 22 October he changed his mind, remembering a powerful British squadron under Rear-Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Louis was patrolling the straits, and headed north, hoping to reach one of the French Atlantic ports. With a storm gathering in strength off the Spanish coast, he sailed westwards to clear <!--del_lnk--> Cape St Vincent, prior to heading north-west, and then swinging eastwards across the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Biscay, aiming to reach the French port at <!--del_lnk--> Rochefort. These four ships would remain at large until their encounter with and attempt to chase a British frigate brought them in range of a British squadron under <!--del_lnk--> Sir Richard Strachan, which captured them all on 4 November 1805 at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Cape Ortegal.</p>

       <p>Only eleven ships escaped to Cadiz, and of those, only five were considered seaworthy. The seriously wounded Admiral Gravina passed command of the remainder of the fleet over to Captain <!--del_lnk--> Julien Cosmao on 23 October, who determined to make an attempt to recapture some of the prizes. He ordered the rigging of his ship, the 74-gun <!--del_lnk--> <i>Pluton</i>, to be repaired and reinforced her crew (which had been depleted by casualties from the battle) with sailors from the French frigate <i><!--del_lnk--> Hermione</i>. Taking advantage of a favourable north-westerly wind, he took the <i>Pluton</i>, the 80-gun <!--del_lnk--> <i>Neptune</i> and <i>Indomptable</i>, the Spanish 100-gun <!--del_lnk--> <i>Rayo</i> and 74-gun <!--del_lnk--> <i>San Francisco de Asis</i>, together with five frigates and two brigs, out of the harbour towards the British.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_British_cast_off_the_prizes">The British cast off the prizes</span></h4>
       <p>Soon after leaving port the wind shifted to west-south-west, raising a heavy sea with the result that most of the British prizes broke their tow-ropes, and, drifting far to <!--del_lnk--> leeward, were only partially re-secured. The combined squadron came in sight at noon, causing Collingwood to summon his most battle-ready ships to meet the threat. In doing so, he ordered them to cast off towing their prizes. He had formed a defensive line of ten ships by three o'clock in the afternoon, and approached the Franco-Spanish squadron, covering the remainder of their prizes which stood out to sea. The Franco-Spanish squadron chose not to approach within gunshot and then declined to attack. Collingwood also chose not seek action, and in the confusion of the powerful storm the French frigates managed to retake two Spanish ships of the line which had been cast off by their British captors, the 112-gun <!--del_lnk--> <i>Santa Ana</i> and 80-gun <!--del_lnk--> <i>Neptuno</i>, taking them in tow and making for Cadiz. On being taken in tow the Spanish crews rose up against their British prize crews, putting them to work as prisoners.</p>
       <p>Despite this initial success the Franco-Spanish force, hampered by battle damage, struggled in the heavy seas. The <i>Neptuno</i> was eventually wrecked off Rota in the gale, while the <i>Santa Ana</i> reached port. The French 80-gun ship <i>Indomptable</i> was wrecked on the 24th or 25th off the town of Rota on the north-west point of the bay of C&aacute;diz. At the time the <i>Indomptable</i> had on board 1,200 men but no more than 100 were saved. The <i>San Francisco de As&iacute;s</i> was driven ashore in C&aacute;diz Bay, near Fort Santa-Catalina, though her crew was saved. The <i>Rayo</i>, an old three-decker with more than 50 years of service, anchored off Lucar, a few leagues to the north-west of Rota. There the <i>Rayo</i> lost her masts; they had been damaged by shot earlier. Heartened by the approach of the squadron, the French crew of the former <!--del_lnk--> flagship <i><!--del_lnk--> Bucentaure</i> also rose up and retook the ship from the British prize crew, but she was wrecked later on 23 October. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Aigle</i>, escaped from the British ship <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Defiance</i> but was wrecked off the port of Santa Mar&iacute;a on 23 October, while the French prisoners on the <i>Berwick</i> cut the tow cables, but caused her to founder off <!--del_lnk--> Sanl&uacute;car on 22 October. The crew of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Algesiras</i> rose up and managed to sail into C&aacute;diz.</p>

       <p>Observing that some of the leewardmost of the prizes were escaping towards the Spanish coast, <!--del_lnk--> HMS&nbsp;<i>Leviathan</i> asked for and was granted permission by Collingwood to try to retrieve the prizes and bring them to anchor. <i>Leviathan</i> went in chase of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Monarca</i>, but on 24 October she came across the <i>Rayo</i>, dismasted but still flying Spanish colours, at anchor off the shoals of San-Lucar. At this point the 74-gun <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Donegal</i>, en route from Gibraltar under Captain <!--del_lnk--> Pulteney Malcolm, was seen approaching from the south on the <!--del_lnk--> larboard tack with a moderate breeze from north-west-by-north, and steered directly for the Spanish three-decker. At about ten o'clock, just as the <i>Monarca</i> had got within little more than a mile of the <i>Rayo</i>, <i>Leviathan</i> fired a warning shot wide of the <i>Monarca</i>, in order to oblige her to drop anchor. The shot fell between the <i>Monarca</i> and the <i>Rayo</i>, the latter, conceiving probably that it was intended for her, hauled down her colours, and was taken by HMS <i>Donegal</i>, who anchored alongside and took off the prisoners. <i>Leviathan</i> resumed her pursuit of the <i>Monarca</i>, eventually catching up and forcing her to surrender. On boarding her, her British captors found that she was in a sinking state, and so removed the British prize crew, and nearly all of her Spanish crew. The nearly empty <i>Monarca</i> parted her cable and was wrecked during the night. Despite the efforts of her British prize crew, the <i>Rayo</i> was driven onshore on 26 October and wrecked, with the loss of twenty-five of the prize crew. The remainder were made prisoners by the Spanish.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Aftermath">Aftermath</span></h4>
       <p>In the aftermath of the storm, Collingwood wrote:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">The condition of our own ships was such that it was very doubtful what would be their fate. Many a time I would have given the whole group of our capture, to ensure our own...

       </blockquote>
       <p>On balance, the Allied counter-attack achieved little. In forcing the British to suspend their repairs in order to defend themselves, it influenced Collingwood's decision to sink or set fire to the most damaged of his remaining prizes. Cosmao retook two Spanish ships of the line, but it cost him one French and two Spanish vessels to do so. Fearing their loss, the British burnt or sank the <i><!--del_lnk--> Santisima Trinidad</i>, <i>Argonauta</i>, <i>San Antonio</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Intrepide</i>. Only four of the British prizes, the French <i><!--del_lnk--> Swiftsure</i>, the Spanish <i>Bahama</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>San Ildefonso</i>, and the Spanish <!--del_lnk--> <i>San Juan Nepomuceno</i> survived to be conducted to England. After the end of the battle and storm only nine ships of the line were left in C&aacute;diz.</p>

       <p>When Rosily arrived in Cadiz, he found only five French ships, rather than the 18 he was expecting. The surviving ships remained bottled up in Cadiz until 1808, when Napoleon invaded Spain. The French ships were then <!--del_lnk--> seized by the Spanish forces and put into service against France.</p>
       <p>HMS <i>Victory</i> made her way to Gibraltar for repairs, carrying Nelson's body. She put into Rosia Bay, Gibraltar and after emergency repairs were carried out, returned to England. Many of the injured crew were brought ashore at Gibraltar and treated in the <a href="../../wp/g/Gibraltar.htm" title="Gibraltar">Naval Hospital</a>. Men who subsequently died from injuries sustained at the battle are buried in or near the <!--del_lnk--> Trafalgar Cemetery, at the south end of <!--del_lnk--> Main Street, Gibraltar.</p>
       <p>One <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Royal_Marines.htm" title="Royal Marine">Royal Marine</a> officer was killed on board <i>Victory</i>, Captain Charles Adair. Royal Marine Lieutenant Lewis Buckle Reeve was seriously wounded and lay next to Nelson.</p>
       <p>The battle took place the day after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Ulm, and Napoleon did not hear about it for weeks&mdash;the <!--del_lnk--> Grande Arm&eacute;e had left <!--del_lnk--> Boulogne to fight Britain's allies before they could combine a huge force. He had tight control over the Paris media and kept the defeat a closely guarded secret. In a propaganda move, the battle was declared a "spectacular victory" by the French and Spanish.</p>
       <p>Vice-Admiral Villeneuve was taken prisoner aboard his flagship and taken back to England. After his <!--del_lnk--> parole in 1806 and return to France, Villeneuve was found in his inn room during a stop on the way to Paris and stabbed six times in the chest with a dining knife. It was recorded that he had committed suicide.</p>
       <p>Despite the British victory over the Franco-Spanish navies, Trafalgar had negligible impact on the remainder of the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Third Coalition. Less than two months later, Napoleon decisively defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Third Coalition at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Austerlitz.htm" title="Battle of Austerlitz">Battle of Austerlitz</a>, knocking Austria out of the war and forcing the dissolution of the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>.

       <p>Nelson&rsquo;s body was put into a barrel of brandy to preserve it for the trip home so he could have a hero&rsquo;s funeral.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Following the battle, the Royal Navy was never again seriously challenged by the French fleet in a large-scale engagement. Napoleon had already abandoned his plans of invasion before the battle and they were never revived. The battle did not mean, however, that the French naval challenge to Britain was over. First, as the French control over the continent expanded, Britain had to take active <!--del_lnk--> steps in 1807 and 1808 to prevent the ships of smaller European navies from falling into French hands. This effort was largely successful, but did not end the French threat as Napoleon instituted a large scale shipbuilding program that produced a fleet of 80 ships of the line at the time of his fall from power in 1814, with more under construction. In comparison Britain had 99 ships of the line in active commission in 1814, and this was close to the maximum that could be supported. Given a few more years, the French could have realised their plans to commission 150 ships of the line and again challenge the Royal Navy, compensating for the inferiority of their crews with sheer numbers. For almost 10&nbsp;years after Trafalgar the Royal Navy maintained a close blockade of French bases and anxiously observed the growth of the French fleet. In the end, Napoleon's Empire was destroyed before the ambitious buildup could be completed.</p>
       <p>Nelson became &ndash; and remains &ndash; Britain's greatest naval war hero, and an inspiration to the Royal Navy, yet his unorthodox tactics were seldom emulated by later generations. The first monument to be erected in Britain to commemorate Nelson may be that raised on <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Green in 1806, albeit possibly preceded by a monument at <!--del_lnk--> Taynuilt, near <!--del_lnk--> Oban dated 1805, both also commemorating the many Scots crew and captains at the battle. The 144 feet (44&nbsp;m) tall <i>Nelson Monument</i> on Glasgow Green was designed by <!--del_lnk--> David Hamilton and paid for by public subscription. Around the base are the names of his famous victories: <!--del_lnk--> Aboukir (1798), <!--del_lnk--> Copenhagen (1801) and Trafalgar (1805). In 1808, <!--del_lnk--> Nelson's Pillar was erected in <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> to commemorate Nelson and his achievements (many sailors at Trafalgar had been Irish), and remained until it was destroyed in a bombing by "Old <!--del_lnk--> IRA" members in 1966. <!--del_lnk--> Nelson's Monument in <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> was built between 1807 and 1815 in the form of an upturned <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescope</a>, and in 1853 a <!--del_lnk--> time ball was added which still drops at noon <!--del_lnk--> GMT to give a time signal to ships in <!--del_lnk--> Leith and the <!--del_lnk--> Firth of Forth. In summer this coincides with the <i>one o'clock gun</i> being fired. The <!--del_lnk--> Britannia Monument in <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Yarmouth.htm" title="Great Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a> was raised by 1819.</p>
       <p>London's famous <a href="../../wp/t/Trafalgar_Square.htm" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a> was named in honour of his victory, and Nelson's statue on <!--del_lnk--> Nelson's Column, finished in 1843, towers triumphantly over it. The statue of Lord Nelson in Bridgetown, Barbados, in what was also once known as Trafalgar Square, was erected in 1813.</p>
       <p>The disparity in losses has been attributed by some historians less to Nelson's daring tactics than to the difference in fighting readiness of the two fleets. Nelson's fleet was made up of ships of the line which had spent considerable amount of sea time during months of blockades of French ports, whilst the French fleet had generally been at anchor in port. However, Villeneuve's fleet had just spent months at sea crossing the Atlantic twice, which supports the proposition that the main difference between the two fleets' combat effectiveness was the morale of the leaders. The daring tactics employed by Nelson were to ensure a strategically decisive result. The results vindicated his naval judgement.</p>
       <p>The Royal Navy proceeded to dominate the seas for the remaining years of sail. Although the victory at Trafalgar was typically given as the reason at the time, modern analysis by historians suggest that relative economic strength was an important underlying cause of British naval mastery.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="100th_anniversary">100th anniversary</span></h2>
       <p>In 1905, there were events up and down the country to commemorate the centenary, although none were attended by any member of the Royal Family, apparently to avoid upsetting the French, with whom the United Kingdom had recently entered the <i><!--del_lnk--> Entente cordiale</i>. King <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Edward_VII.htm" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII</a> did support the <i>Nelson Centenary Memorial Fund</i> of the <!--del_lnk--> British and Foreign Sailors Society, which sold Trafalgar centenary souvenirs marked with the <!--del_lnk--> Royal cypher.

       <p>In 2005, a series of events around the UK, as part of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sea Britain</i> theme, marked the bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar. The 200th anniversary of the <!--del_lnk--> battle was also marked by six days of celebrations in <a href="../../wp/p/Portsmouth.htm" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> during June and July, and at <a href="../../wp/s/St_Paul%2527s_Cathedral.htm" title="St Paul's Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> (where Nelson is entombed) and in Trafalgar Square in London in October (<i><!--del_lnk--> T Square 200</i>), as well as across the UK.</p>
       <p>On 28 June, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen</a> was involved in the biggest <!--del_lnk--> Fleet Review in modern times in the <!--del_lnk--> Solent, in which 167 ships from 35 nations took part. The Queen inspected the international fleet from the Antarctic patrol ship <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Endurance</i>. The fleet included six carriers: <!--del_lnk--> <i>Charles De Gaulle</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Illustrious</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Invincible</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Ocean</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Pr&iacute;ncipe de Asturias</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Saipan</i>. In the evening a symbolic re-enactment of the battle was staged with fireworks and various small ships playing parts in the battle.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Lapenoti&egrave;re's historic voyage in <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Pickle</i> bringing the news of victory from the fleet to <!--del_lnk--> Falmouth and thence by post chaise to the <!--del_lnk--> Admiralty in London, was commemorated by the inauguration of <!--del_lnk--> The Trafalgar Way and further highlighted by the <!--del_lnk--> New Trafalgar Dispatch celebrations from July to September, in which an actor played the part of Lapenoti&egrave;re and reenacted parts of the historic journey.</p>
       <p>On 21 October, naval manoeuvres were conducted in Trafalgar Bay, near Cadiz, involving a combined fleet from Britain, Spain and France. Many descendants of those men who fought and died in these waters, including members of Nelson's family, were present at the ceremony.</p>
