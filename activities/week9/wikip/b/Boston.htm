       <p><b>Boston</b> (pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> /&#x2C8;b&#x252;st&#x259;n/</span>) is the <!--del_lnk--> capital of and largest city in <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts, and is one of the oldest cities in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. The largest city in <!--del_lnk--> New England, Boston is regarded as the unofficial "Capital of New England" for its economic and cultural impact on the entire New England region. The <!--del_lnk--> city proper had a 2009 estimated population of 645,169, making it the <!--del_lnk--> twentieth largest in the country. Boston is also the anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area called <!--del_lnk--> Greater Boston, home to 4.5 million people and the <!--del_lnk--> tenth-largest metropolitan area in the country. Greater Boston as a commuting region includes six <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts counties: Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Plymouth, Worcester, northern Bristol County, all of <a href="../../wp/r/Rhode_Island.htm" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a> and parts of <!--del_lnk--> New Hampshire; it is home to 7.6 million people, making it the <!--del_lnk--> fifth-largest Combined Statistical Area in the United States.</p>
       <p>In 1630, <a href="../../wp/p/Puritan.htm" title="Puritan">Puritan</a> colonists from <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> founded the city on the <!--del_lnk--> Shawmut Peninsula. During the late 18th century, Boston was the location of several major events during the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution, including the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Massacre and the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Tea Party. Several early battles of the American Revolution, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Bunker Hill and the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Boston, occurred within the city and surrounding areas. Through <!--del_lnk--> land reclamation and <!--del_lnk--> municipal annexation, Boston has expanded beyond the peninsula. After American independence was attained Boston became a major shipping port and manufacturing centre, and its rich history now helps attract over 20 million visitors annually. The city was the site of several firsts, including America's first public school, <!--del_lnk--> Boston Latin School (1635), and the first <!--del_lnk--> subway system in the United States (1897).</p>
       <p>With many colleges and universities within the city and surrounding area, Boston is an international center of higher education and a centre for medicine. The city's economy is also based on research, electronics, engineering, finance, and high technology&mdash;principally <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a>. As a result, the city is a leading finance centre, ranking <!--del_lnk--> 14th in the Z/Yen top 20 Global Financial Centers. The city was also ranked number one for innovation, both globally and in North America, for a variety of reasons. Boston has been experiencing <!--del_lnk--> gentrification, and has one of the highest <!--del_lnk--> costs of living in the United States, though it remains high on <!--del_lnk--> world livability rankings, ranking third in the US and 37th globally.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Boston was founded on September 17, 1630, by <a href="../../wp/p/Puritan.htm" title="Puritan">Puritan</a> colonists from England. The Puritans of the <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Bay Colony are sometimes confused with the <!--del_lnk--> Pilgrims, who founded <!--del_lnk--> Plymouth Colony ten years earlier in what is today <!--del_lnk--> Bristol County, <!--del_lnk--> Plymouth County, and <!--del_lnk--> Barnstable County, Massachusetts. The two groups, which differed in religious practice, are historically distinct. The separate colonies were not united until the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Shawmut Peninsula was connected to the mainland by a narrow <!--del_lnk--> isthmus and was surrounded by the waters of <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Bay and the Back Bay, an <!--del_lnk--> estuary of the <!--del_lnk--> Charles River. Several prehistoric <a href="../../wp/n/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States.htm" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> archaeological sites that were excavated in the city have shown that the peninsula was inhabited as early as 5000 BC. Boston's early European settlers first called the area <i>Trimountaine</i>, but later <!--del_lnk--> renamed the town after <!--del_lnk--> Boston, Lincolnshire, England, from which several prominent colonists had emigrated. <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Bay Colony's original governor, <!--del_lnk--> John Winthrop, gave a famous sermon entitled "<!--del_lnk--> A Model of Christian Charity", popularly known as the "City on a Hill" sermon, which espoused the idea that Boston had a special covenant with God. (Winthrop also led the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge Agreement, which is regarded as a key founding document of the city.) Puritan ethics molded a stable and well-structured society in Boston. For example, shortly after Boston's settlement, Puritans founded America's first public school, <!--del_lnk--> Boston Latin School (1635). Between 1636 and 1698, six major <a href="../../wp/s/Smallpox.htm" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> epidemics in Boston had caused a substantial number of deaths. Boston was the largest town in British North America until <a href="../../wp/p/Philadelphia.htm" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> grew larger in the mid-18th century.</p>

       <p>In the 1770s, British attempts to exert more-stringent control on the <!--del_lnk--> thirteen colonies&mdash;primarily via taxation&mdash;led to the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution. The <!--del_lnk--> Boston Massacre, the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Tea Party, and several early battles&mdash;including the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Lexington and Concord, the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Bunker Hill, and the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Boston&mdash;occurred in or near the city. During this period, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Revere made his famous midnight ride. After the Revolution, Boston had become one of the world's wealthiest international trading ports because of the city's consolidated seafaring tradition. Exports included rum, fish, salt, and tobacco. During this era, descendants of old Boston families were regarded as the nation's social and cultural elites; they were later dubbed the <i><!--del_lnk--> Boston Brahmins</i>.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Embargo Act of 1807, adopted during the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812 significantly curtailed Boston's harbour activity. Although foreign trade returned after these hostilities, Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and by the mid-19th century, the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance. Until the early 20th century, Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers and was notable for its <a href="../../wp/c/Clothing.htm" title="Clothing">garment</a> production and <!--del_lnk--> leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region made for easy shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads facilitated the region's industry and commerce. From the mid-19th to late 19th century, Boston flourished culturally. It became renowned for its rarefied literary culture and lavish artistic patronage. It also became a centre of the <!--del_lnk--> abolitionist movement.</p>

       <p>In 1822, the citizens of Boston voted to change the official name from "the Town of Boston" to "the City of Boston", and on March 4, 1822, the people of Boston accepted the charter incorporating the City. At the time Boston was chartered as a city, the population was about 46,226, while the area of the city was only 4.7 square miles (12&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). In the 1820s, Boston's population began to swell, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of European <!--del_lnk--> immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period. By 1850, about 35,000 <!--del_lnk--> Irish lived in Boston. In the latter half of the 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, <!--del_lnk--> Lebanese, Syrians, <!--del_lnk--> French Canadians, and <!--del_lnk--> Russian and <!--del_lnk--> Polish Jews settle in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants&mdash;Italians inhabited the <!--del_lnk--> North End, Irish dominated <!--del_lnk--> South Boston and <!--del_lnk--> Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the <!--del_lnk--> West End. <!--del_lnk--> Irish and <!--del_lnk--> Italian immigrants brought with them <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community, and since the early 20th century, the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics&mdash;prominent figures include the <!--del_lnk--> Kennedys, <!--del_lnk--> Tip O'Neill, and <!--del_lnk--> John F. Fitzgerald.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Between 1631 and 1890, the city tripled its physical size by <!--del_lnk--> land reclamation&mdash;by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront &mdash;a process that <!--del_lnk--> Walter Muir Whitehill called "cutting down the hills to fill the coves". The largest reclamation efforts took place during the 19th century. Beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50-<!--del_lnk--> acre (20&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ha) mill pond that later became the <!--del_lnk--> Haymarket Square area. The present-day <!--del_lnk--> State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the <!--del_lnk--> South End, the <!--del_lnk--> West End, the <!--del_lnk--> Financial District, and <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown. After <!--del_lnk--> The Great Boston Fire of 1872, workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront. During the mid-to-late 19th century, workers filled almost 600&nbsp;acres (2.4&nbsp;km&sup2;) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of <!--del_lnk--> Boston Common with gravel brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights. Also, the city annexed the adjacent towns of <!--del_lnk--> South Boston (1804), <!--del_lnk--> East Boston (1836), <!--del_lnk--> Roxbury (1868), <!--del_lnk--> Dorchester (including present day <!--del_lnk--> Mattapan and a portion of <!--del_lnk--> South Boston) (1870), <!--del_lnk--> Brighton (including present day <!--del_lnk--> Allston) (1874), <!--del_lnk--> West Roxbury (including present day <!--del_lnk--> Jamaica Plain and <!--del_lnk--> Roslindale) (1874), <!--del_lnk--> Charlestown (1874), and <!--del_lnk--> Hyde Park (1912). Other proposals, for the annexation of <!--del_lnk--> Brookline, Cambridge, and Chelsea, have been unsuccessful.</p>
       <p>By the early and mid-20th century, the city was in decline as factories became old and obsolete, and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere. Boston responded by initiating various <!--del_lnk--> urban renewal projects under the direction of the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), which was established in 1957. In 1958, BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighbourhood. Extensive demolition was met with vociferous public opposition. BRA subsequently reevaluated its approach to urban renewal in its future projects, including the construction of <!--del_lnk--> Government Centre. In 1965, the first <!--del_lnk--> Community Health Center in the United States opened, the Columbia Point Health Centre, in the <!--del_lnk--> Dorchester neighbourhood. It mostly served the massive <!--del_lnk--> Columbia Point public housing complex adjoining it, which was built in 1953. The health center is still in operation and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Centre.</p>

       <p>By the 1970s, the city's economy boomed after 30 years of economic downturn. A large number of high rises were constructed in the <!--del_lnk--> Financial District and in Boston's <!--del_lnk--> Back Bay during this time period. This boom continued into the mid-1980s and later began again. Boston now has the second largest skyline in the Northeast (after New York) in terms of the number of buildings reaching a height of over 500 feet (150&nbsp;m). Hospitals such as <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts General Hospital, <!--del_lnk--> Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre, and <!--del_lnk--> Brigham and Women's Hospital lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as <!--del_lnk--> Boston University, the <!--del_lnk--> Harvard Medical School, <!--del_lnk--> Northeastern University, and <!--del_lnk--> Boston Conservatory attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over <!--del_lnk--> desegregation busing, which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s. In 1984, the City of Boston gave control of the Columbia Point public housing complex to a private developer, who redeveloped and revitalized the property from its rundown and dangerous state into an attractive residential mixed-income community called Harbour Point Apartments, which opened in 1988 and was completed by 1990. It was the first federal housing project to be converted to private, mixed-income housing in the United States, and served as a model for the federal <!--del_lnk--> HUD <!--del_lnk--> HOPE VI public housing revitalization program that began in 1992.</p>

       <p>In the early 21st century, the city has become an intellectual, technological, and political centre. It has, however, experienced a loss of regional institutions, which included the acquisition of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Boston Globe</i> by <i><!--del_lnk--> The New York Times</i>, and the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such as <!--del_lnk--> FleetBoston Financial, which was acquired by <!--del_lnk--> Charlotte-based <!--del_lnk--> Bank of America in 2004. Boston-based department stores <!--del_lnk--> Jordan Marsh and <!--del_lnk--> Filene's have both been merged into the New York&ndash;based <!--del_lnk--> Macy's. Boston has also experienced <!--del_lnk--> gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen, and Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the United States, and was ranked the 99th most expensive major city in the world in a 2008 survey of 143 cities. Despite cost, Boston ranks high on livability ratings, ranking 35th <!--del_lnk--> worldwide in quality of living in 2009 in a survey of 215 major cities.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geography">Geography</span></h2>
       <p>Owing to its early founding, Boston is very compact. According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 89.6&nbsp;square miles (232.1&nbsp;km&sup2;)&mdash;48.4&nbsp;square miles (125.4&nbsp;km&sup2;) (54.0%) of land and 41.2&nbsp;square miles (106.7&nbsp;km&sup2;) (46.0%) of water. Boston is the country's <!--del_lnk--> fourth most densely populated city that is not a part of a larger city's <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area. This is largely attributable to the <!--del_lnk--> rarity of annexation by <!--del_lnk--> New England towns. Of United States cities with more than 600,000 people, only <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco.htm" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> is smaller in land area. Boston is surrounded by the "<!--del_lnk--> Greater Boston" region and is bordered by the <!--del_lnk--> cities and towns of <!--del_lnk--> Winthrop, <!--del_lnk--> Revere, <!--del_lnk--> Chelsea, <!--del_lnk--> Everett, <!--del_lnk--> Somerville, <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge, <!--del_lnk--> Watertown, <!--del_lnk--> Newton, <!--del_lnk--> Brookline, <!--del_lnk--> Needham, <!--del_lnk--> Dedham, <!--del_lnk--> Canton, <!--del_lnk--> Milton, and <!--del_lnk--> Quincy. The <!--del_lnk--> Charles River separates Boston proper from Cambridge, Watertown, and the neighbourhood of Charlestown. To the east lies <!--del_lnk--> Boston Harbour and the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Harbour Islands National Recreation Area (BHINRA), which includes part of the city's territory, specifically <!--del_lnk--> Calf Island, <!--del_lnk--> Gallops Island, <!--del_lnk--> Great Brewster Island, <!--del_lnk--> Green Island, <!--del_lnk--> Little Brewster Island, <!--del_lnk--> Little Calf Island, <!--del_lnk--> Long Island, <!--del_lnk--> Lovells Island, <!--del_lnk--> Middle Brewster Island, <!--del_lnk--> Nixes Mate, <!--del_lnk--> Outer Brewster Island, <!--del_lnk--> Rainsford Island, <!--del_lnk--> Shag Rocks, <!--del_lnk--> Spectacle Island, <!--del_lnk--> The Graves, and <!--del_lnk--> Thompson Island. The <!--del_lnk--> Neponset River forms the boundary between Boston's southern neighborhoods and the city of <!--del_lnk--> Quincy and the town of <!--del_lnk--> Milton. The <!--del_lnk--> Mystic River separates Charlestown from Chelsea and Everett, and Chelsea Creek and Boston Harbour separate East Boston from Boston proper. Boston's official elevation, as measured at <!--del_lnk--> Logan International Airport, is 19&nbsp;ft (5.8&nbsp;m) above sea level. The highest point in Boston is <!--del_lnk--> Bellevue Hill at 330&nbsp;ft (101&nbsp;m) above sea level, and the lowest point is at sea level.</p>

       <p>Much of the <!--del_lnk--> Back Bay and <!--del_lnk--> South End neighborhoods are built on <!--del_lnk--> reclaimed land&mdash;all of the earth from two of Boston's three original hills, the "trimount", was used as landfill material. Only <!--del_lnk--> Beacon Hill&mdash;the smallest of the three original hills&mdash;remains partially intact; only half of its height was cut down for landfill. The downtown area and immediate surroundings consist mostly of low-rise brick or stone buildings, with many older buildings in the <!--del_lnk--> Federal style. Several of these buildings mix in with modern high-rises, notably in the Financial District, <!--del_lnk--> Government Centre, the <!--del_lnk--> South Boston waterfront, and Back Bay, which includes many prominent landmarks such as the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Public Library, <!--del_lnk--> Christian Science Centre, <!--del_lnk--> Copley Square, <!--del_lnk--> Newbury Street, and New England's two tallest buildings&mdash;the <!--del_lnk--> John Hancock Tower and the <!--del_lnk--> Prudential Centre.</p>

(In the summer, flashing red indicates instead that a <!--del_lnk--> Red Sox game has been rained out.) Smaller commercial areas are interspersed among single-family homes and wooden/brick multi-family row houses. Currently, the South End Historic District remains the largest surviving contiguous Victorian-era neighbourhood in the U.S. Along with downtown, the geography of <!--del_lnk--> South Boston was particularly impacted by the <!--del_lnk--> Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) Project (or the <!--del_lnk--> "Big Dig"). The unstable reclaimed land in South Boston posed special problems for the project's tunnels. In the downtown area, the CA/T Project allowed for the removal of the unsightly elevated <!--del_lnk--> Central Artery and the incorporation of new green spaces and open areas.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Boston Common, located near the Financial District and Beacon Hill, is the oldest public park in the United States. Along with the adjacent <!--del_lnk--> Boston Public Garden, it is part of the <!--del_lnk--> Emerald Necklace, a string of parks designed by <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Law Olmsted to encircle the city. <!--del_lnk--> Jamaica Pond, part of the Emerald Necklace, is the largest body of freshwater in the city. <!--del_lnk--> Franklin Park, which is also part of the Emerald Necklace, is the city's largest park and houses the <!--del_lnk--> Franklin Park Zoo, recognized in all of New England. Another major park is the Esplanade, located along the banks of the Charles River. The <!--del_lnk--> Hatch Shell, an outdoor concert venue, is located adjacent to the Charles River Esplanade.

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Neighborhoods">Neighborhoods</span></h3>
       <p>Boston is sometimes called a "city of neighborhoods" because of the profusion of diverse subsections. There are 21 official neighborhoods in Boston used by the city. These neighborhoods include: <!--del_lnk--> Allston/<!--del_lnk--> Brighton, <!--del_lnk--> Back Bay, <!--del_lnk--> Bay Village, <!--del_lnk--> Beacon Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Charlestown, <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown/<!--del_lnk--> Leather District, <!--del_lnk--> Dorchester, Downtown/<!--del_lnk--> Financial District, <!--del_lnk--> East Boston, <!--del_lnk--> Fenway/Kenmore, <!--del_lnk--> Hyde Park, <!--del_lnk--> Jamaica Plain, <!--del_lnk--> Mattapan, <!--del_lnk--> Mission Hill, <!--del_lnk--> North End, <!--del_lnk--> Roslindale, <!--del_lnk--> Roxbury, <!--del_lnk--> South Boston, <!--del_lnk--> South End, <!--del_lnk--> West End, and <!--del_lnk--> West Roxbury.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
       <p>Boston has a climate that is <!--del_lnk--> continental in nature but with maritime influences owing to its coastal location, a phenomenon common to coastal southern New England. The climate is classified as either <!--del_lnk--> humid continental or <!--del_lnk--> humid subtropical (<!--del_lnk--> Koppen <i>Dfa</i>, <i>Cfa</i> respectively). Summers are typically warm, rainy, and humid, while winters are cold, windy, and snowy. Spring and fall are usually mild, but conditions are widely varied, depending on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore affect Boston, minimizing the influence of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic">Atlantic Ocean</a>.</p>

       <p>Boston's coastal location on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="North Atlantic">North Atlantic</a>, although it moderates temperatures, also makes the city very prone to <!--del_lnk--> Nor'easter weather systems that can produce much snow and rain. The city averages 42.5 inches (1,080&nbsp;mm) of <!--del_lnk--> precipitation a year, with 41.8 inches (106&nbsp;cm) of snowfall a year. Snowfall increases dramatically as one goes inland away from the city (especially north and west of the city)&mdash;away from the warming influence of the ocean. Most snowfall occurs from December through March. There is usually little or no snow in April and November, and snow is rare in May and October.</p>
       <p>Fog is prevalent, particularly in spring and early summer, and the occasional tropical storm or <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Hurricane">hurricane</a> can threaten the region, especially in early autumn. Due to its situation along the North Atlantic, the city is often subjected to <!--del_lnk--> sea breeze, especially in the late spring, when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than <span style="white-space:nowrap;">20 &deg;F</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(11&nbsp;&deg;C)</span> colder than a few miles inland, sometimes dropping by that amount near midday.

       <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> 2000 United States Census, there were 589,141 people, 239,528 households, and 115,212 families residing in the city. The <!--del_lnk--> population density was 12,166 people per square mile (4,697/km&sup2;). There were 251,935 housing units at an average density of 5,203 per square mile (2,009/km&sup2;). The 2009 U.S. Census population estimate for the city is 645,169, a 9.5% increase from 2000. During weekdays, the population of Boston can grow during the daytime to over 1.2&nbsp;million, and can reach as many as 2 million during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.</p>
       <p>In the city, the population was spread out with 19.8% under the age of 18, 16.2% from 18 to 24, 35.8% from 25 to 44, 17.8% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% who were 65&nbsp;years of age or older. The median age was 31&nbsp;years. For every 100 females, there were 92.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.2 males. There were 239,528 households, of which 22.7% had children under the age of 18 living in them, 27.4% were <!--del_lnk--> married couples living together, 16.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 51.9% were non-families. 37.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 3.17. Boston has a large presence of gays and lesbians, which is estimated to be at 12.3%; the highest concentration of homosexuals is in the South End neighbourhood.</p>

Of the total population, 25.6% of those under the age of 18 and 18.2% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.</p>
       <p>Since the 1950s with the advent of <!--del_lnk--> white flight, the proportion of whites in the city has declined with the city becoming <!--del_lnk--> minority-majority in the 2000 Census. Surprisingly, a 2006 Census estimate suggests that this trend may have reversed, with whites again occupying a slight majority.</p>
       <p>According to the 2006-2008 <!--del_lnk--> American Community Survey, the racial composition of Boston was as follows:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> White: 56.3% (<!--del_lnk--> Non-Hispanic Whites: 50.6%)</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Black or African American: 23.5%</li>

        <li><!--del_lnk--> Hispanic or Latino (of any race): 16.1%</li>
       </ul>
       <p>People of <!--del_lnk--> Irish descent form the largest single <!--del_lnk--> ethnic group in the city, making up 15.8% of the population, followed by <!--del_lnk--> Italians, accounting for 8.3% of the population. People of <!--del_lnk--> West Indian ancestry are another sizable group, at 6.4%, about half of whom are of <!--del_lnk--> Haitian ancestry. Some neighborhoods, such as Dorchester, have received an influx of people of <!--del_lnk--> Vietnamese ancestry in recent decades. Neighborhoods such as Jamaica Plain and Roslindale have experienced a growing number of <!--del_lnk--> Dominican Americans.</p>
       <p>The city also has a sizable <!--del_lnk--> Jewish population with an estimated 21,000 Jews within the city and 22 synagogues. The adjacent communities of <!--del_lnk--> Brookline and <!--del_lnk--> Newton are both approximately one third Jewish.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Accent">Accent</span></h3>
       <p>The "Boston accent" is widely parodied in the U.S. as the speech of the Kennedys. It is <!--del_lnk--> non-rhotic (i.e., drops the "r" sound at the end of syllables unless the next syllable starts with a vowel) and traditionally uses a "broad a" in certain words, so "bath" can sound like "bahth". Boston English has many dialect words, such as "frappe", meaning "milkshake made with ice cream" (as opposed to other milkshakes). The accent originated in the non-rhotic speech of 17th century <!--del_lnk--> East Anglia and <!--del_lnk--> Lincolnshire.</p>

       <p>The city has seen a great reduction in violent <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">crime</a> since the early 1990s. Boston's low crime rate over the past decade or so has been credited to the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Police Department's collaboration with neighbourhood groups and church parishes to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from the <!--del_lnk--> United States Attorney and <!--del_lnk--> District Attorney's offices. This helped lead in part to what has been touted as the "Boston Miracle". Murders in the city dropped from 152 in 1990 (for a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people) to just 31&mdash;not one of them a juvenile&mdash;in 1999 (for a murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000).</p>
       <p>In the first decade of the 21st century, however, the annual murder count has fluctuated by as much as 50% compared with the year before, with 60 murders in 2002, followed by just 39 in 2003, 64 in 2004, and 75 in 2005. Although the figures are nowhere near the high-water mark set in 1990, the aberrations in the murder rate have been unsettling for many Bostonians and have prompted discussion over whether the Boston Police Department should reevaluate its approach to fighting crime.</p>

       <p>Boston's colleges and universities have a significant effect on the regional economy, with students contributing an estimated $4.8&nbsp;billion annually to the city's economy. Boston's schools are major employers and attract industries to the city and surrounding region. Boston is home to a number of <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technology</a> companies and is a hub for <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, with the <!--del_lnk--> Milken Institute rating Boston as the top <!--del_lnk--> life sciences cluster in the country.

       <p>Tourism comprises a large part of Boston's economy. In 2004, tourists spent $7.9&nbsp;billion and made the city one of the ten-most-popular tourist locations in the country. Because of Boston's status as a state capital and the regional home of federal agencies, law and government are another major component of the city's economy. The city is also a major <!--del_lnk--> seaport along the United States' East Coast and is also the oldest continuously operated industrial and <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">fishing</a> port in the <!--del_lnk--> Western Hemisphere.</p>
       <p>Some of the other important industries are <!--del_lnk--> financial services, especially <!--del_lnk--> mutual funds and <!--del_lnk--> insurance. Boston-based <!--del_lnk--> Fidelity Investments helped popularize the mutual fund in the 1980s and has made Boston one of the top financial cities in the United States. The city is home to the regional headquarters of <!--del_lnk--> Bank of America and <!--del_lnk--> Sovereign Bank, and it is a centre for <!--del_lnk--> venture capital firms. <!--del_lnk--> State Street Corporation, which specializes in asset management and custody services, is based in the city. A 2008 study ranked Boston among the top 10 cities in the world for a career in finance. Boston is a printing and publishing centre&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Houghton Mifflin is headquartered within the city, along with <!--del_lnk--> Bedford-St. Martin's Press, <!--del_lnk--> Beacon Press, and <!--del_lnk--> Little, Brown and Company. <!--del_lnk--> Pearson PLC publishing units also employ several hundred people in Boston. The city is home to three major <!--del_lnk--> convention centers&mdash;the <!--del_lnk--> Hynes Convention Centre in the Back Bay, and the <!--del_lnk--> Seaport World Trade Centre and <!--del_lnk--> Boston Convention and Exhibition Center on the South Boston waterfront. Boston once had a fourth convention center, the Bayside Expo Centre in Dorchester, which was lost in a foreclosure on Corcoran-Jennison in 2009 to a Florida-based real estate firm, LNR/CMAT, who bought it. Soon after, the University of Massachusetts Boston bought the property from them to build campus facilities.</p>
       <p>Some of the major companies headquartered within the city are the <!--del_lnk--> Liberty Mutual insurance company, <!--del_lnk--> Gillette (now owned by <!--del_lnk--> Procter &amp; Gamble), and <!--del_lnk--> New Balance. Boston is also home to <!--del_lnk--> management consulting firms <!--del_lnk--> The Boston Consulting Group and <!--del_lnk--> Bain &amp; Company, as well as the private equity group Bain Capital. <!--del_lnk--> The Ad Club serves as a networking company to Boston-based companies and advertising. Other major companies are located outside the city, especially along <!--del_lnk--> Route 128, which serves as the centre of the region's high-tech industry. In 2006, Boston and its metropolitan area ranked as the fourth-largest cybercity in the United States with 191,700 high-tech jobs. Only NYC Metro, DC Metro, and <!--del_lnk--> Silicon Valley have larger high-tech sectors.</p>
       <p>Encompassing $363 billion, the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Boston metropolitan area has the <!--del_lnk--> sixth-largest economy in the country. Boston is classified as an "incipient <!--del_lnk--> global city" by a 2004 study group at <!--del_lnk--> Loughborough University in England.</p>

       <p>The city has a number of ornate theatres, including the <!--del_lnk--> Cutler Majestic Theatre, <!--del_lnk--> Boston Opera House, <!--del_lnk--> Citi Performing Arts Center, the Colonial Theatre, and the Orpheum Theatre. Renowned performing-arts organizations include the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Symphony Orchestra, <!--del_lnk--> Boston Ballet, <!--del_lnk--> Boston Early Music Festival, <!--del_lnk--> Boston Lyric Opera Company, OperaBoston, and the <!--del_lnk--> Handel and Haydn Society (one of the oldest choral companies in the United States). The city is also a major centre for contemporary classical music, with a number of performing groups, some of which are associated with the city's conservatories and universities. There are also many major annual events such as <!--del_lnk--> First Night, which occurs on <!--del_lnk--> New Year's Eve, the annual <!--del_lnk--> Boston Arts Festival at Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park, Italian summer feasts in the North End honoring Catholic saints, and several events during the <!--del_lnk--> Fourth of July period. These events include the week-long Harborfest festivities and a <!--del_lnk--> Boston Pops concert accompanied by fireworks on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Charles River.</p>
       <p>Because of the city's prominent role in the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution, several historic sites relating to that period are preserved as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Boston National Historical Park. Many are found along the <!--del_lnk--> Freedom Trail, which is marked by a red line of bricks embedded in the ground. The city is also home to several prominent art museums, including the <!--del_lnk--> Museum of Fine Arts and the <!--del_lnk--> Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. In December 2006, the <!--del_lnk--> Institute of Contemporary Art moved from its Back Bay location to a new contemporary building designed by <!--del_lnk--> Diller Scofidio + Renfro located in the Seaport District.

       <p>Boston is also one of the birthplaces of the <!--del_lnk--> hardcore punk genre of music. Boston musicians have contributed significantly to this music scene over the years (<i>see also <!--del_lnk--> Boston hardcore</i>). Boston neighborhoods were home to one of the leading local <!--del_lnk--> third wave ska and <!--del_lnk--> ska punk scenes in the 1990s, led by bands such as <!--del_lnk--> The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and <!--del_lnk--> The Allstonians. The 1980s' hardcore punk-rock compilation <i><!--del_lnk--> This Is Boston, Not L.A.</i> highlights some of the bands that built the genre. Several nightclubs, such as <!--del_lnk--> The Channel, Bunnratty's in <!--del_lnk--> Allston, and <!--del_lnk--> The Rathskeller, were renowned for showcasing both local punk-rock bands and those from farther afield. All of these clubs are now closed. Many were razed or converted during recent gentrification.</p>
       <p>Boston has been a noted religious centre from its earliest days. The <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral of the Holy Cross (1875) in the South End, while the <!--del_lnk--> Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, with the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral Church of St. Paul (1819) as its episcopal seat, serves just under 200 congregations. Two <!--del_lnk--> Protestant faiths are headquartered in Boston: <!--del_lnk--> Unitarian Universalism, with its headquarters on Beacon Hill, and the <!--del_lnk--> Christian Scientists, headquartered in Back Bay at the <!--del_lnk--> Mother Church (1894). The oldest church in Boston is <!--del_lnk--> King's Chapel, the city's first Anglican church, founded in 1686 and converted to Unitarianism in 1785. Other notable churches include Christ Church (better known as <!--del_lnk--> Old North Church, 1723), the oldest church building in the city, <!--del_lnk--> Trinity Church (1733), <!--del_lnk--> Park Street Church (1809), <!--del_lnk--> First Church in Boston (congregation founded 1630, building raised 1868), <!--del_lnk--> Old South Church (1874), and <!--del_lnk--> Mission Hill's <!--del_lnk--> Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help (1878).</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Boston Red Sox, a founding member of the <!--del_lnk--> American League of <!--del_lnk--> Major League Baseball in 1901, play their home games at <!--del_lnk--> Fenway Park, near <!--del_lnk--> Kenmore Square in the <!--del_lnk--> Fenway section of Boston. Built in 1912, it is the oldest sports arena or stadium in active use in the United States among the four major professional American sports leagues, encompassing <!--del_lnk--> Major League Baseball, the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Football_League.htm" title="National Football League">National Football League</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/National_Basketball_Association.htm" title="National Basketball Association">National Basketball Association</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Hockey_League.htm" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a>. Boston was also the site of the first game of the first modern <!--del_lnk--> World Series, in 1903. The series was played between the AL Champion <!--del_lnk--> Boston Americans and the NL champion <!--del_lnk--> Pittsburgh Pirates. Persistent reports that the team was known in 1903 as the "Boston Pilgrims" appear to be unfounded. Boston's first professional baseball team was the Red Stockings, one of the charter members of the <!--del_lnk--> National League in 1871. The team played under that name until 1883, under the name Beaneaters until 1911, and under the name Braves from 1912 until they moved to <!--del_lnk--> Milwaukee after the 1952 season. Since 1966 they have played in <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta.htm" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> as the <!--del_lnk--> Atlanta Braves.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> TD Garden (formerly called the FleetCenter and the Shawmut Centre) is adjoined to <!--del_lnk--> North Station and is the home of three major league teams: the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Blazers of the <!--del_lnk--> National Lacrosse League, the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Bruins of the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Hockey_League.htm" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a>; and the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Celtics, the 2008 <a href="../../wp/n/National_Basketball_Association.htm" title="National Basketball Association">National Basketball Association</a> champions. The arena seats 18,624 for basketball games and 17,565 for ice hockey venues. The Bruins were the first American member of the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Hockey_League.htm" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a> and an <!--del_lnk--> Original Six franchise. The Boston Celtics were founding members of the <!--del_lnk--> Basketball Association of America, one of the two leagues that merged to form the NBA. The Celtics have the distinction of having won more championships than any other NBA team, with seventeen.</p>
       <p>While they have played in suburban <!--del_lnk--> Foxborough since 1971, the <!--del_lnk--> New England Patriots were founded in 1960 as the Boston Patriots. A charter member of the <!--del_lnk--> American Football League, the team joined the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Football_League.htm" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> in 1970. The team has won the <!--del_lnk--> Super Bowl three times, in 2001, 2003, and 2004. They share <!--del_lnk--> Gillette Stadium with the <!--del_lnk--> New England Revolution of <!--del_lnk--> Major League Soccer. The <!--del_lnk--> Boston Breakers of <!--del_lnk--> Women's Professional Soccer, which formed in 2009, play their home games at Harvard Stadium in <!--del_lnk--> Allston.</p>
       <p>Boston's many colleges and universities are active in college athletics. Four <!--del_lnk--> NCAA Division I members play their games in the city&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Boston College (<!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Coast Conference), <!--del_lnk--> Boston University (<!--del_lnk--> America East Conference), <!--del_lnk--> Harvard University (<!--del_lnk--> Ivy League), and <!--del_lnk--> Northeastern University (<!--del_lnk--> Colonial Athletic Association). Of the four, only Boston College participates in college football at the highest level, the <!--del_lnk--> Football Bowl Subdivision. Harvard participates in the second-highest level, the <!--del_lnk--> Football Championship Subdivision. Boston University and Northeastern University do not have football teams. All but Harvard belong to the <!--del_lnk--> Hockey East conference; Harvard belongs to the <!--del_lnk--> ECAC in hockey. The hockey teams of these four universities meet every year in a four-team tournament known as the "<!--del_lnk--> Beanpot Tournament", which is played at the TD Garden over two Monday nights in February.</p>
       <p>One of the best known sporting events in the city is the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Marathon, the 26.2&nbsp;mile (42.2&nbsp;km) run from <!--del_lnk--> Hopkinton to Copley Square in the Back Bay which is the world's oldest annual marathon run. It is run on <!--del_lnk--> Patriots' Day in April and always coincides with a Red Sox home baseball game that starts at 11:05 AM, the only MLB game all year to start before noon local time. Another major event held annually in the city is the <!--del_lnk--> Head of the Charles Regatta rowing competition on the Charles River.</p>

       <p>Boston's reputation as an intellectual centre, "the <!--del_lnk--> Athens of America", derives in large part from the teaching and research activities of more than 100 colleges and universities located in the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Boston Area, with more than 250,000 students attending college in Boston and Cambridge alone. Within the city, <!--del_lnk--> Boston University exudes a large presence as the city's fourth-largest employer, and maintains a campus along the Charles River on <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Avenue and its medical campus in the <!--del_lnk--> South End. <!--del_lnk--> Northeastern University, another large private university, is located in the <!--del_lnk--> Fenway area, and is particularly known for its Business and Health Science schools and cooperative education program. <!--del_lnk--> Suffolk University, the third largest university in Boston, is located in the <!--del_lnk--> Beacon Hill area, and is known for its <!--del_lnk--> law school and business programs. <!--del_lnk--> Boston College, a private Catholic Jesuit university, whose original campus was located in the South End, now straddles the Boston (Brighton)-Newton border, with planned expansions further into Brighton. Boston's only public university is the <!--del_lnk--> University of Massachusetts Boston, located on Columbia Point in <!--del_lnk--> Dorchester. <!--del_lnk--> Roxbury Community College and <!--del_lnk--> Bunker Hill Community College are the city's two public community colleges.</p>
       <p>Boston has several smaller private colleges and universities. <!--del_lnk--> Emmanuel College, <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts College of Art and Design, <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, <!--del_lnk--> Simmons College, <!--del_lnk--> Wheelock College, and <!--del_lnk--> Wentworth Institute of Technology are founding members of the <!--del_lnk--> Colleges of the Fenway and are located adjacent to Northeastern University. <!--del_lnk--> New England School of Law, a small private law school located in the theatre district, was originally established as America's first all female law school. <!--del_lnk--> Emerson College, a small private college with a strong reputation in the fields of performing arts, journalism, writing, and film, is located near Boston Common.</p>

The <!--del_lnk--> business and <!--del_lnk--> medical schools are in Boston, and there are plans for additional expansion into Boston's <!--del_lnk--> Allston neighbourhood. The <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which originated in Boston and was long known as "<!--del_lnk--> Boston Tech", moved across the river to Cambridge in 1916. <!--del_lnk--> Tufts University administers its medical and dental school adjacent to the <!--del_lnk--> Tufts Medical Centre, a 451-bed academic medical institution that is home to both a full-service hospital for adults and the Floating Hospital for Children.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Boston Public Schools, the oldest public school system in the U.S., enrolls 57,000 students from <!--del_lnk--> pre-kindergarten to grade 12. The system operates 145 schools, which includes <!--del_lnk--> Boston Latin School (the oldest public school in the United States, established in 1635) which, along with <!--del_lnk--> Boston Latin Academy and <!--del_lnk--> John D. O'Bryant School of Math &amp; Science, are highly prestigious public exam schools admitting students in the 7th and 9th grades only and serving grades 7&ndash;12), <!--del_lnk--> English High (the oldest public <!--del_lnk--> high school, established 1821), and <!--del_lnk--> the Mather School (the oldest public elementary school, established in 1639). In 2002, <i><!--del_lnk--> Forbes Magazine</i> ranked the Boston Public Schools as the best large city school system in the country, with a graduation rate of 82%. In 2005, the student population within the school system was 45.5% Black or African American, 31.2% Hispanic or Latino, 14% White, and 9% Asian, as compared with 24%, 14%, 49%, and 8% respectively for the city as a whole. The city also has private, parochial, and <!--del_lnk--> charter schools and approximately 3000 students of racial minorities attend participating suburban schools through the Metropolitan Educational Opportunity Council, or <!--del_lnk--> METCO.</p>

       <p>Downtown Boston's streets were not organized on a grid, but grew in a meandering organic pattern from early in the 17th century. They were created as needed, and as wharves and landfill expanded the area of the small Boston peninsula. Along with several <!--del_lnk--> rotaries, roads change names and lose and add lanes seemingly at random. By contrast, streets in the <!--del_lnk--> Back Bay, <!--del_lnk--> East Boston, the <!--del_lnk--> South End, and <!--del_lnk--> South Boston do follow a <!--del_lnk--> grid system.</p>
       <p>Boston is the eastern terminus of cross-continent <!--del_lnk--> I-90, which in Massachusetts runs along the <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Turnpike. Originally known as the Circumferential Highway, <!--del_lnk--> Route 128 carries <!--del_lnk--> I-95 over a portion of its route west and north of the city. <!--del_lnk--> U.S. 1 and <!--del_lnk--> I-93 run concurrently north to south through the city from Charlestown to Dorchester, joined by <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Route 3 after the <!--del_lnk--> Zakim Bridge over the Charles River. The elevated portion of the <!--del_lnk--> Central Artery, which carried these routes through downtown Boston, was replaced with the <!--del_lnk--> O'Neill Tunnel during the <!--del_lnk--> Big Dig, substantially completed in early 2006.</p>

       <p>Between 1999 and 2006, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bicycling</i> magazine named Boston as one of the worst cities in the U.S. for cycling three times; regardless, it has one of the highest rates of bicycle commuting. In September 2007, Mayor Menino started a bicycle program called Boston Bikes with a goal of improving bicycling conditions by adding bike lanes, racks, and offering bikeshare programs. In 2008, as a consequence the same magazine put Boston on its list of its "Five for the Future" list as a "Future Best City" for biking.</p>
