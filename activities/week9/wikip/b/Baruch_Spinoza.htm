Revealing considerable scientific aptitude, the breadth and importance of Spinoza's work was not fully realized until years after his death. Today, he is considered one of the great <!--del_lnk--> rationalists of <!--del_lnk--> 17th-century philosophy, laying the groundwork for the 18th century <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> and modern <!--del_lnk--> biblical criticism. By virtue of his <!--del_lnk--> magnum opus, the posthumous <i><!--del_lnk--> Ethics</i>, Spinoza is also considered one of <!--del_lnk--> Western philosophy's definitive ethicists.</p>
       <p>Spinoza lived quietly as a <!--del_lnk--> lens grinder, turning down rewards and honours throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions, and gave his family inheritance to his sister. Spinoza's moral character and philosophical accomplishments prompted 20th century philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Gilles Deleuze to name him "the absolute philosopher." Spinoza died in February 1677 of a lung illness, perhaps <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> or <!--del_lnk--> silicosis caused by fine <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a> dust inhaled while tending to his trade.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biography">Biography</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Family_origins">Family origins</span></h3>
       <p>Spinoza's ancestors were of <!--del_lnk--> Sephardic Jewish descent, and were a part of the community of <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese Jews that grew in the city of <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> after the <!--del_lnk--> Alhambra Decree in Spain (1492) and the <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese Inquisition (1536) had led to <!--del_lnk--> forced conversions and expulsions from the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian peninsula.  Some historians argue the Spinoza family had its remote origins in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>; others claim they were Portuguese Jews who had moved to Spain and then returned to their home country in 1492, only to be forcibly converted to <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholicism</a> in 1498. Spinoza's father was born roughly a century after this forced conversion in the small Portuguese city of <!--del_lnk--> Vidigueira, near <!--del_lnk--> Beja in <!--del_lnk--> Alentejo. When Spinoza's father was still a child, Spinoza's grandfather, Isaac de Spinoza (who was from <a href="../../wp/l/Lisbon.htm" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>), took his family to <!--del_lnk--> Nantes in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. They were expelled in 1615 and moved to <a href="../../wp/r/Rotterdam.htm" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, where Isaac died in 1627. Spinoza's father, Miguel, and his uncle, Manuel, then moved to Amsterdam where they assumed their Judaism. Manuel changed his name to Abra&atilde;o de Spinoza, though his "commercial" name was still the same.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life_and_career">Early life and career</span></h3>
       <p>Baruch Spinoza was born in <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, in the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. His mother Ana D&eacute;bora, Miguel's second wife, died when Baruch was only six years old. Miguel was a successful importer/merchant and Baruch had a traditional Jewish upbringing; however, his critical, curious nature would soon come into conflict with the Jewish community. After wars with England and France took the life of his father and decimated his family's fortune, he was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his brother, Gabriel, and devote himself to philosophy and optics.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Controversial_ideas_and_Jewish_reaction">Controversial ideas and Jewish reaction</span></h3>
       <p>Spinoza became known in the Jewish community for positions contrary to normative Jewish belief, with critical positions towards the <!--del_lnk--> Talmud and other religious texts. In the summer of 1656, he was issued the writ of <i><!--del_lnk--> cherem</i> (Hebrew: &#x5D7;&#x5E8;&#x5DD;, a kind of <!--del_lnk--> excommunication) from the Jewish community, perhaps for the <!--del_lnk--> apostasy of how he conceived <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a>, although the reason is not stated in the <i>cherem</i>. Righteous indignation on the part of the synagogue elders at Spinoza's heresies was probably not the sole cause for the excommunication; there was also the practical concern that his ideas, which disagree equally well with the orthodoxies of other religions as with Judaism, would not sit well with the Christian leaders of <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> and would reflect badly on the whole Jewish community, endangering the limited freedoms that the Jews had already achieved in that city. The terms of his <i>cherem</i> were severe. He was, in <a href="../../wp/b/Bertrand_Russell.htm" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>'s words, "cursed with all the curses in <!--del_lnk--> Deuteronomy and with the curse that <!--del_lnk--> Elisha pronounced on the children who, in consequence, were torn to pieces by the she-bears." It was never revoked. Following his excommunication, he adopted the first name Benedictus, the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> equivalent of his given name, Baruch; they both mean "blessed". In his native Amsterdam he was also known as Bento (Portuguese for Benedict or blessed) de Spinoza, which was the informal form of his name.</p>
       <p>After his <i>cherem</i>, it is reported that Spinoza lived and worked in the school of <!--del_lnk--> Franciscus van den Enden, who taught him Latin in his youth and may have introduced him to modern philosophy, although Spinoza never mentions Van den Enden anywhere in his books or letters. Van den Enden was a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Dualism_%2528philosophy_of_mind%2529.htm" title="Cartesian dualism">Cartesian</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheist">atheist</a> who was forbidden by the city government to propagate his doctrines publicly. Spinoza, having dedicated himself completely to philosophy after 1656, fervently desired to change the world through establishing a clandestine philosophical sect. Because of public censure this was only eventually realized after his death through the dedicated intercession of his friends.</p>
       <p>During this period Spinoza also became acquainted with several <!--del_lnk--> Collegiants, members of an eclectic <!--del_lnk--> sect with tendencies towards <!--del_lnk--> rationalism. Spinoza also corresponded with <!--del_lnk--> Peter Serrarius, a radical <!--del_lnk--> Protestant and <!--del_lnk--> millennarian merchant. Serrarius is believed to have been a patron of Spinoza at some point. By the beginning of the 1660s, Spinoza's name became more widely known, and eventually <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Henry Oldenburg paid him visits, as stated in Matthew Stewart's "The Courtier and the Heretic.". He corresponded with Oldenburg for the rest of his short life. Spinoza's first publication was his <!--del_lnk--> <i>Tractatus de intellectus emendatione</i>. From December 1664 to June 1665, Spinoza engaged in correspondence with <!--del_lnk--> Blyenbergh, an amateur <!--del_lnk--> Calvinist theologian, who questioned Spinoza on the definition of <!--del_lnk--> evil. Later in 1665, he notified Oldenburg that he had started to work on a new book, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Theologico-Political Treatise</i>, published in 1670. Leibniz disagreed harshly with Spinoza in Leibniz's own published <!--del_lnk--> Refutation of Spinoza, but he is also known to have met with Spinoza on at least one occasion, and his own work bears certain striking resemblances to certain key parts of Spinoza's philosophy (see: <!--del_lnk--> Monadology).</p>
       <p>When the public reactions to the anonymously published <i>Theologico-Political Treatise</i> were extremely unfavourable to his brand of Cartesianism, Spinoza was compelled to abstain from publishing more of his works. Wary and independent, he wore a <!--del_lnk--> signet ring engraved with his initials, a rose and the word "caute" (Latin for "cautiously"). The <i>Ethics</i> and all other works, apart from the <i><!--del_lnk--> Principles of Cartesian Philosophy</i> and the <i>Theologico-Political Treatise</i>, were published after his death in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Opera Posthuma</i> edited by his friends in secrecy to avoid confiscation and destruction of manuscripts.</p>

       <p>Spinoza relocated from Amsterdam to <!--del_lnk--> Rijnsburg (near <!--del_lnk--> Leiden) around 1661 and later lived in <!--del_lnk--> Voorburg and <a href="../../wp/t/The_Hague.htm" title="The Hague">The Hague</a> respectively. He earned a comfortable living from <!--del_lnk--> lens-grinding. While the lens-grinding aspect of Spinoza's work is uncontested, the type of lenses he made is in question. Many have said he produced excellent magnifying glasses, and some historians credit him with being an <!--del_lnk--> optician (in the sense of making lenses for eyeglasses). He was also supported by small, but regular, donations from close friends. He died in 1677 while still working on a political thesis. His premature death was due to lung illness, possibly the result of breathing in glass dust from the lenses he ground. Only a year earlier, Spinoza had met with Leibniz at <a href="../../wp/t/The_Hague.htm" title="The Hague">The Hague</a> for a discussion of his principal philosophical work, <i><!--del_lnk--> Ethics</i>, which had been completed in 1676. This meeting was described in Matthew Stewart's <i>The Courtier and the Heretic</i>.  Spinoza never married, nor did he father any children. When he died, he was considered a heathen anti-religionist by the general population, and when <!--del_lnk--> Boerhaave wrote his dissertation in 1688 he attacked the doctrines of Spinoza. He claimed later that defense of Spinoza's lifestyle cost him his reputation in <!--del_lnk--> Leiden and a post as <!--del_lnk--> minister.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dutch_Port_cities_as_sites_of_free_thought">Dutch Port cities as sites of free thought</span></h3>
       <p>Amsterdam and Rotterdam were important cosmopolitan centers where merchant ships from many parts of the world brought people of various customs and beliefs. It is this hustle and bustle which ensured, as in the Mediterranean region during the Renaissance, some possibility of free thought and shelter from the crushing hand of ecclesiastical authority. Thus Spinoza no doubt had access to a circle of friends who were basically heretics in the eyes of tradition. One of the people he must have known was <!--del_lnk--> Niels Stensen, a brilliant Danish student in Leiden; others were <!--del_lnk--> Coenraad van Beuningen and his cousin <!--del_lnk--> Albert Burgh, with whom Spinoza is known to have corresponded.</p>

       <blockquote>
        <p>"These are the fundamental concepts with which Spinoza sets forth a vision of Being, illuminated by his awareness of God. They may seem strange at first sight. To the question "What is?" he replies: "Substance, its attributes and modes". <i>Spinoza</i>, Karl Jaspers p.9</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical thought, offering powerful weapons for prevailing against "received authority." As a youth he first subscribed to <!--del_lnk--> Descartes's <a href="../../wp/d/Dualism_%2528philosophy_of_mind%2529.htm" title="Dualism (philosophy of mind)">dualistic</a> belief that body and mind are two separate substances, but later changed his view and asserted that they were not separate, being a single identity. He contended that everything that exists in Nature/Universe is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality which surrounds us and of which we are part. Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality, namely the single <!--del_lnk--> substance (meaning "that which stands beneath" rather than "matter") that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser "entities" are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause and effect is only understood in part. That humans presume themselves to have <!--del_lnk--> free will, he argues, is a result of their awareness of appetites while being unable to understand the reasons why they want and act as they do. The argument for the single substance runs as follows:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Substance exists and cannot be dependent on anything else for its existence.</li>
        <li>No two substances can share the same nature or attribute. <dl>
          <dd>Proof: Two distinct substances can be differentiated either by some difference in their natures or by some difference in one of their alterable states of being. If they have different natures, then the original proposition is granted and the proof is complete. If, however, they are distinguished only by their states of being, then, considering the substances in themselves, there is no difference between the substances and they are identical. "That is, there cannot be several such substances but only one."</dd>
         </dl>
        </li>
        <li>A substance can only be caused by something similar to itself (something that shares its attribute).</li>
        <li>Substance cannot be caused. <dl>
          <dd>Proof: Something can only be caused by something which is similar to itself, in other words something that shares its attribute. But according to premise 2, no two substances can share an attribute. Therefore substance cannot be caused.</dd>
         </dl>
        </li>
        <li>Substance is infinite. <dl>
          <dd>Proof: If substance were not infinite, it would be finite and limited by something. But to be limited by something is to be dependent on it. However, substance cannot be dependent on anything else (premise 1), therefore substance is infinite.</dd>
         </dl>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <dl>
        <dd>Conclusion: There can only be one substance. <dl>
          <dd>Proof: If there were two infinite substances, they would limit each other. But this would act as a restraint, and they would be dependent on each other. But they cannot be dependent on each other (premise 1), therefore there cannot be two substances.</dd>
         </dl>
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p>Spinoza contended that "<i><!--del_lnk--> Deus sive Natura</i>" ("God or Nature") was a being of infinitely many attributes, of which extension and thought were two. His account of the nature of reality, then, seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as one and the same. The universal substance consists of both body and mind, there being no difference between these aspects. This formulation is a historically significant solution to the <!--del_lnk--> mind-body problem known as <!--del_lnk--> neutral monism. The consequences of Spinoza's system also envisage a God that does not rule over the universe by providence, but a God which itself is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part. Thus, God is the natural world and He has no personality.</p>
       <p>In addition to substance, the other two fundamental concepts Spinoza presents, and develops in the <i>Ethics</i> are</p>
       <p>Attribute:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>By attribute, I mean that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>and Mode:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>By mode, I mean the modifications of substance, or that which exists in, and is conceived through, something other than itself.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Spinoza was a thoroughgoing <!--del_lnk--> determinist who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of <!--del_lnk--> necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand <i>why</i> we act as we do. So freedom is not the possibility to say "no" to what happens to us but the possibility to say "yes" and fully understand why things should necessarily happen that way. By forming more "adequate" ideas about what we do and our emotions or <!--del_lnk--> affections, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does. Therefore, humans have no free will. They believe, however, that their will is free. In his letter to G. H. Schaller (Letter 62), he wrote: "men are conscious of their own desire, but are ignorant of the causes whereby that desire has been determined." </p>
       <p>Spinoza's philosophy has much in common with <a href="../../wp/s/Stoicism.htm" title="Stoicism">Stoicism</a> in as much as both philosophies sought to fulfill a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain <!--del_lnk--> happiness (or <!--del_lnk--> eudaimonia, for the Stoics). However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected their contention that <!--del_lnk--> reason could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of <a href="../../wp/s/Sigmund_Freud.htm" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> psychoanalysis.</p>
       <p>Spinoza's philosophy shares some points of similarity with themes in <!--del_lnk--> Advaita Vedanta, a <i>sampradhya</i> or school of thought in Hinduism, especially as expounded by <a href="../../wp/a/Adi_Shankara.htm" title="Adi Shankara">Adi Shankara</a>. These Indian philosophers from the 8th and 11th centuries respectively emphasize the notion of one reality (substance here), <a href="../../wp/b/Brahman.htm" title="Brahman">Brahman</a> and the notion of attributes, a position which could be construed as not dissimilar to Spinoza's.</p>
       <p>Some of Spinoza's philosophical positions are:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The natural world is infinite.</li>
        <li>Good and evil are related to human pleasure and pain.</li>
        <li>Everything done by humans and other animals is excellent and divine.</li>
        <li>All rights are derived from the State.</li>
        <li>Animals can be used in any way by people for the benefit of the human race, according to a rational consideration of the benefit as well as the animal's status in nature.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ethical_philosophy">Ethical philosophy</span></h3>
       <p>Encapsulated at the start in his <i>Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding</i> (<i>Tractatus de intellectus emendatione</i>) is the core of Spinoza's ethical philosophy, what he held to be the true and final good. Spinoza held a <!--del_lnk--> relativist's position, that nothing is intrinsically good or bad, except to the extent that it is subjectively perceived to be by the individual. Things are only good or evil in respect that humanity sees it desirable to apply these conceptions to matters. Instead, Spinoza believes in his deterministic universe that, "All things in nature proceed from certain necessity and with the utmost perfection." Therefore, nothing happens by chance in Spinoza's world, and reason does not work in terms of <!--del_lnk--> contingency.</p>
       <p>In the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects, or of God/Nature. According to Spinoza, reality is perfection. If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality. While elements of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason, our grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence. Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful for rhetoric, is inadequate for discovering universal truth; Spinoza's mathematical and logical approach to metaphysics, and therefore ethics, concluded that emotion is formed from inadequate understanding. His concept of "<!--del_lnk--> conatus" states that human beings' natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being and an assertion that virtue/human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as one's central ethical doctrine. According to Spinoza, the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God/Nature/Universe.</p>
       <p>In the final part of the "<!--del_lnk--> Ethics" his concern with the meaning of "true blessedness" and his unique approach to and explanation of how emotions must be detached from external cause in order to master them presages 20th-century psychological techniques. His concept of three types of knowledge - opinion, reason, intuition - and assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, leads to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal. His unique contribution to understanding the workings of mind is extraordinary, even during this time of radical philosophical developments, in that his views provide a bridge between religions' mystical past and psychology of the present day.</p>
       <p>Given Spinoza's insistence on a completely ordered world where "necessity" reigns, <!--del_lnk--> Good and Evil have no absolute meaning. Human catastrophes, social injustices, etc. are merely apparent. The world as it exists looks imperfect only because of our limited perception.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pantheism_controversy">Pantheism controversy</span></h2>
       <p>In 1785, <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi published a condemnation of Spinoza's <!--del_lnk--> pantheism, after <!--del_lnk--> Lessing was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a "Spinozist", which was the equivalent in his time of being called an atheist. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended <!--del_lnk--> substance. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute <a href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheism">atheism</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Moses Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between <!--del_lnk--> theism and pantheism. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to antinomies (statements that could be proven both right and wrong) in thought.</p>
       <p>The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>the unity of all that exists;</li>
        <li>the regularity of all that happens; and</li>
        <li>the identity of spirit and nature.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Spinoza's "God or Nature" provided a living, natural God, in contrast to the Newtonian mechanical "First Cause" or the dead mechanism of the French "Man Machine."</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Late 20th century <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> demonstrated a greater philosophical interest in Spinoza, often from a <!--del_lnk--> left-wing or <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> perspective. Notable philosophers <!--del_lnk--> Gilles Deleuze, <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Negri, <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;tienne Balibar and the Brazilian philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Marilena Chau&iacute; have each written books on Spinoza. Deleuze's doctoral thesis, published in 1968, refers to him as "the prince of philosophers." Other philosophers heavily influenced by Spinoza include <!--del_lnk--> Constantin Brunner and <!--del_lnk--> John David Garcia. <!--del_lnk--> Stuart Hampshire wrote a major English language study of Spinoza, though <!--del_lnk--> H. H. Joachim's work is equally valuable. Unlike most philosophers, Spinoza and his work were highly regarded by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Friedrich_Nietzsche.htm" title="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>.</p>
       <p>Philosopher <a href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_Wittgenstein.htm" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> evoked Spinoza with the title (suggested to him by <!--del_lnk--> G. E. Moore) of the English translation of his first definitive philosophical work, <i><!--del_lnk--> Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i>, an allusion to Spinoza's <!--del_lnk--> Tractatus Theologico-Politicus. Elsewhere, Wittgenstein deliberately borrowed the expression <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i> from Spinoza (<i>Notebooks, 1914-16</i>, p. 83). The structure of his <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> does have certain structural affinities with Spinoza's <i>Ethics</i> (though, admittedly, not with the latter's own <i>Tractatus</i>) in erecting complex philosophical arguments upon basic logical assertions and principles. Furthermore, in propositions 6.4311 and 6.45 he alludes to a Spinozian understanding of eternity and interpretation of the religious concept of eternal life, stating that "If by eternity is understood not eternal temporal duration, but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present." (6.4311) "The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation as a limited whole." (6.45) Furthermore, Wittgenstein's interpretation of religious language, in both his early and later career, may be said to bear a family resemblance to Spinoza's pantheism.</p>
       <p>Spinoza has had influence beyond the confines of philosophy. The nineteenth century novelist, <a href="../../wp/g/George_Eliot.htm" title="George Eliot">George Eliot</a>, produced her own translation of the <i>Ethics</i>, the first known English translation thereof. The twentieth century novelist, <!--del_lnk--> W. Somerset Maugham, alluded to one of Spinoza's central concepts with the title of his novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> Of Human Bondage</i>. <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> named Spinoza as the philosopher who exerted the most influence on his world view (<!--del_lnk--> Weltanschauung). Spinoza equated God (infinite substance) with Nature, consistent with Einstein's belief in an impersonal deity. In 1929, Einstein was asked in a telegram by <!--del_lnk--> Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein whether he believed in God. Einstein responded by telegram: "I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings." Spinoza's pantheism has also influenced environmental theory. <!--del_lnk--> Arne N&aelig;ss, the father of the <!--del_lnk--> deep ecology movement, acknowledged Spinoza as an important inspiration. Moreover, the Argentinian writer <a href="../../wp/j/Jorge_Luis_Borges.htm" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> was greatly influenced by Spinoza's world view. In many of his poems and short stories, Borges makes constant allusions to the philosopher's work, though not necessarily as a partisan of his doctrines, but merely in order to use these for aesthetic purposes--a common tactic in Borges's work.</p>
       <p>Spinoza is an important historical figure in the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, where his portrait was featured prominently on the Dutch 1000-<!--del_lnk--> guilder <a href="../../wp/b/Banknote.htm" title="Banknote">banknote</a>, <!--del_lnk--> legal tender until the <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">euro</a> was introduced in 2002. The highest and most prestigious scientific award of the Netherlands is named the <i>Spinoza prijs</i> (Spinoza prize). Spinoza's work is also mentioned as the favourite reading material for <!--del_lnk--> Bertie Wooster's valet <!--del_lnk--> Jeeves in the <!--del_lnk--> P. G. Wodehouse novels.</p>
