       <p><b>Bergen-Belsen</b> (or <b>Belsen</b>) was a <!--del_lnk--> Nazi concentration camp in <!--del_lnk--> Lower Saxony, southwest of the town of <!--del_lnk--> Bergen near <!--del_lnk--> Celle. Between 1943 and 1945, an estimated 50,000 people died there, up to 35,000 of them dying of <!--del_lnk--> typhus in the first few months of 1945.</p>
       <p>The camp was liberated on <!--del_lnk--> April 15, <a href="../../wp/1/1945.htm" title="1945">1945</a> by the <!--del_lnk--> British 11th Armoured Division. Sixty thousand prisoners were found inside, most of them seriously ill, and another 13,000 corpses lay around the camp unburied. The scenes that greeted British troops were famously described by the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> Richard Dimbleby, who accompanied them:</p>

         <td style="border:none; color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-weight: bold; text-align: left; padding: 10px 10px;" valign="top" width="20">&ldquo;</td>
         <td style="border: none; padding: 4px 10px;" valign="top">Here over an acre of ground lay dead and dying people. You could not see which was which ... The living lay with their heads against the corpses and around them moved the awful, ghostly procession of emaciated, aimless people, with nothing to do and with no hope of life, unable to move out of your way, unable to look at the terrible sights around them ... Babies had been born here, tiny wizened things that could not live ... A mother, driven mad, screamed at a British sentry to give her milk for her child, and thrust the tiny mite into his arms, then ran off, crying terribly. He opened the bundle and found the baby had been dead for days. <p>This day at Belsen was the most horrible of my life.</p>

       <p>Bergen-Belsen was first set up in 1940 as the <!--del_lnk--> prisoner of war camp <!--del_lnk--> Stalag XI-C (named Stalag XI-C/311 for 600 Belgian and French POW's). Between this time and the spring of 1942, about 18,000 <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> soldiers died of hunger, cold and disease.</p>
       <p>In 1942, Bergen-Belsen became a <!--del_lnk--> concentration camp and was placed under <!--del_lnk--> SS command in April 1943. Initially it was designated <i>Aufenthaltslager</i> ("detention camp") to hold several thousand <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/Jews.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a> intended to be sent overseas in exchange for German civilians who were interned. In March 1944, part of the camp was redesignated as an <i>Erholungslager</i> ("recovery camp"), where prisoners too sick to work were brought from other camps. In August 1944, a shipment of approximately 8,000 female prisoners of various nationalities arrived from <!--del_lnk--> Auschwitz, most of whom were sent to <!--del_lnk--> Arbeitskommandos to work in factories.</p>
       <p>December 1944 saw the completion of the change-over of Bergen-Belsen into a concentration camp when SS-<!--del_lnk--> Hauptsturmf&uuml;hrer <!--del_lnk--> Josef Kramer, previously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, became the new camp commander. The number of inmates in the camp on <!--del_lnk--> December 1, <a href="../../wp/1/1944.htm" title="1944">1944</a>, was 15,257. In 1945, large numbers of prisoners were moved to Belsen from the eastern camps as the Soviet forces advanced. The resulting overcrowding led to a vast increase in deaths from disease (particularly <!--del_lnk--> typhus) and malnutrition in a camp originally designed to hold about 10,000 inmates. The number of inmates increased from 22,000 on <!--del_lnk--> February 1, <a href="../../wp/1/1945.htm" title="1945">1945</a>, to 41,520 on <!--del_lnk--> March 1, 43,042 on <!--del_lnk--> April 1 and ultimately to about 60,000 on <!--del_lnk--> April 15. The number of deaths increased from 7,000 in February to 18,168 during March and 9,000 during the first half of April. The bodies of these prisoners were buried in mass graves.</p>
       <p>There were no <!--del_lnk--> gas chambers in Bergen-Belsen, since the mass executions took place in the camps further east. Nevertheless, an estimated 50,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/Jews.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Czechs, <!--del_lnk--> Poles, anti-Nazi <!--del_lnk--> Christians, <!--del_lnk--> homosexuals, and <!--del_lnk--> Roma and <!--del_lnk--> Sinti (Gypsies) died in the camp. Among them were Czech painter and writer <!--del_lnk--> Josef &#x10C;apek (est. April 1945), as well as <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> residents <a href="../../wp/a/Anne_Frank.htm" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> (who died of typhus) and her sister <!--del_lnk--> Margot, who died there in March 1945. The average life expectancy of an inmate was nine months.</p>
       <p>After the war, there were allegations that the camp (or possibly a section of it), was "of a privileged nature", compared to others. A lawsuit filed by the Jewish community in <!--del_lnk--> Thessaloniki against 55 alleged collaborators claims that 53 of them were sent to Bergen-Belsen "as a special favour" granted by the Germans.</p>

       <p>When the British and Canadians advanced near the camp in 1945, the German army negotiated an exclusion zone around it to prevent the spread of <!--del_lnk--> typhus. Hungarian and regular German troops guarding the camp returned to German lines after the engagement. Some SS guards also fled the camp; however, a number remained, wearing white armbands as a sign of surrender. As a final act of defiance, the last of the Germans to leave cut the water supply to the camp, making it hard for the Allied troops to treat the ill prisoners. On the 13th day after liberation, the <a href="../../wp/l/Luftwaffe.htm" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> bombed one of the hospitals where the sick were being treated, injuring or killing several <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement.htm" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> workers.</p>
       <p>When British and Canadian troops liberated the camp on <!--del_lnk--> April 15, <a href="../../wp/1/1945.htm" title="1945">1945</a>, they found thousands of bodies unburied and forced the remaining SS personnel to bury them. Over the next days the surviving prisoners were deloused and moved to a nearby German <!--del_lnk--> Panzer army camp, which became the <!--del_lnk--> Bergen-Belsen DP camp. Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was then burned to the ground by vehicle-mounted <!--del_lnk--> flamethrowers because of a <!--del_lnk--> typhus epidemic and <!--del_lnk--> louse infestation. Accounts of Belsen after this time refer to events at the Bergen-Belsen DP camp.</p>
       <p>In spite of massive efforts to help the survivors, about another 9,000 died in April, and by the end of June 1945 another 4,000 had died (after liberation a total of 13,994 people died). The total number of deaths at Bergen-Belsen from 1943 to June 1945 was about 50,000.</p>
       <p>The British troops and medical staff tried these diets to feed the prisoners, in this order:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Bully beef from Army rations. Most of the prisoners' digestive systems were in too weak a state from long-term starvation to handle such food, and their stomachs rejected it with <!--del_lnk--> vomiting and <a href="../../wp/d/Diarrhea.htm" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a>.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Skimmed milk. The result was a bit better, but still far from acceptable.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Bengal Famine Mixture. This is a rice-and-sugar-based mixture which had achieved good results after the <!--del_lnk--> Bengal famine of 1943, but it proved less suitable to Europeans than to Bengalis because of the differences in the food to which they were accustomed. Adding <a href="../../wp/p/Paprika.htm" title="Paprika">paprika</a> to it proved to make it easier for the prisoners to digest, and recovery started.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Many of the former <!--del_lnk--> SS staff that survived the <!--del_lnk--> typhus epidemic were tried by the British at the <!--del_lnk--> Belsen Trial. At the trial, the world got its first view of <!--del_lnk--> Irma Grese, <!--del_lnk--> Elisabeth Volkenrath, <!--del_lnk--> Juana Bormann, <!--del_lnk--> Fritz Klein, <!--del_lnk--> Josef Kramer, and the rest of the SS men and women who before served at <!--del_lnk--> Mittelbau Dora, <!--del_lnk--> Ravensbr&uuml;ck, <!--del_lnk--> Auschwitz I, II, III, and <!--del_lnk--> Neuengamme. Many of the female guards had served at small <!--del_lnk--> Gross Rosen subcamps at <!--del_lnk--> Neusalz, <!--del_lnk--> Langenleuba, and the <!--del_lnk--> Mittelbau-Dora subcamp at <!--del_lnk--> Gross Werther.</p>
       <p>The site is open to the public, featuring a visitors' centre, <!--del_lnk--> a monument to the dead, and a "House of Silence" for reflection.</p>
       <p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 15 <a href="../../wp/2/2005.htm" title="2005">2005</a> there was a commemorative ceremony, and many ex-prisoners and ex-liberating troops attended.</p>
