       <p>He came to national attention working with Damon in <i><!--del_lnk--> Good Will Hunting</i> in 1997, for which they shared credit and received the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Academy_Award.htm" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> for <!--del_lnk--> Best Original Screenplay. Along with Damon and producers <!--del_lnk--> Chris Moore and Sean Bailey, Affleck founded the production company <!--del_lnk--> LivePlanet, through which the four created the documentary series <i><!--del_lnk--> Project Greenlight</i>, as well as the failed mystery-hybrid series <i><!--del_lnk--> Push, Nevada</i> amongst other projects. <i>Project Greenlight</i> was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002, 2004 and 2005.</p>
       <p>Following <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, Affleck starred in <i><!--del_lnk--> Armageddon</i> (1998) as A. J. Frost, opposite <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Willis. The film generated mostly mixed to negative critical reviews, but was a box office success earning $553&nbsp;million worldwide. In 1999, he co-starred with <!--del_lnk--> Sandra Bullock in the romantic comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> Forces of Nature</i>. In 2001, Affleck collaborated with <i>Armageddon</i> director <!--del_lnk--> Michael Bay in the war film <i><!--del_lnk--> Pearl Harbour</i>. The film generated mixed reception, but was a box office success, earning $449&nbsp;million worldwide.</p>
       <p>In 2002 he was cast as <!--del_lnk--> Jack Ryan in the action film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sum of All Fears</i>. The movie also starred <!--del_lnk--> Morgan Freeman. <i>The Sum of All Fears</i> is based on the <!--del_lnk--> book of the same name by <!--del_lnk--> Tom Clancy. Ann Hornaday of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Washington Post</i> wrote, Affleck and Freeman "create a believable chemistry". In the same year, Affleck starred opposite <!--del_lnk--> Samuel L. Jackson in the thriller <i><!--del_lnk--> Changing Lanes</i>.</p>
       <p>The following year he starred as the titular character <!--del_lnk--> Matt Murdock/Daredevil in <!--del_lnk--> Mark Steven Johnson's <i><!--del_lnk--> Daredevil</i> (2003). Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." He also stated another reason, being "I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." <!--del_lnk--> Roger Ebert, in review of <i>Daredevil</i>, wrote that both Affleck and co-star <!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Garner, were suitable for their roles. <i>Daredevil</i> grossed over $179&nbsp;million worldwide. Following <i>Daredevil</i>, Affleck starred in several critically panned box office flops, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Gigli</i> (2003) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Surviving Christmas</i> (2004), and his career waned considerably.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2006_to_present">2006 to present</span></h3>
       <p>Affleck made what could be considered a comeback with the September 2006 release of the critically acclaimed <!--del_lnk--> George Reeves <!--del_lnk--> noir <!--del_lnk--> biopic <i><!--del_lnk--> Hollywoodland</i>, directed by <!--del_lnk--> HBO TV-series veteran Allen Coulter. His performance was well-received; <!--del_lnk--> Peter Travers of <i><!--del_lnk--> Rolling Stone</i>, in review of the film, wrote: "The irony is that Affleck's battering at the hands of fame has prepped him beautifully to play Reeves. He knows this character from the inside: the surface charm, the hidden vulnerability, the ache of watching a career become a joke and being helpless to stop it." Claudia Puig of <i><!--del_lnk--> USA Today</i> wrote that Affleck gives a "strong performance". For his performance, he was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the <!--del_lnk--> Venice Film Festival and won the Supporting Actor of the Year award at the Hollywood Film Festival, and was nominated for a <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture.</p>
       <p>Following the success of <i>Hollywoodland</i>, he appeared in the 2007 action film <i><!--del_lnk--> Smokin' Aces</i>. In the film, Affleck plays Jack Dupree, a bounty hunter. <i>Smokin' Aces</i> received mixed reviews from critics, and was a box office failure. Also in 2007, Affleck made his directorial debut, which starred his brother Casey, with <i><!--del_lnk--> Gone Baby Gone</i>, for which he also co-wrote the screenplay, about two Boston area detectives investigating a little girl's kidnapping and how it affects their lives. Based on the book by Dennis Lehane, it opened to rave reviews in October 2007. When asked why he decided to direct the film, Affleck said: "Directing a movie was really instructive for me. I think I learned a lot about writing, and a lot about acting, and I learned how all the pieces fit together from the inside. That was really valuable. It was a good thing." The film received critical acclaim. Lisa Schwarzbaum of <i><!--del_lnk--> Entertainment Weekly</i> noted that Affleck "shows excellent instincts" as a director. Stephanie Zacharek of <!--del_lnk--> Salon.com wrote, "As a director, Ben Affleck may turn out to be quite good with actors [...] But he may need to work harder at shaping material, and at making his characters emerge as rounded, believable people."</p>

       <p>In 2009, Affleck returned to film, starring in three features, <i><!--del_lnk--> He's Just Not That into You</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> State of Play</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Extract</i>. In <i>He's Just Not That into You</i>, a romantic comedy, he was part of an ensemble cast that included <!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Aniston, <!--del_lnk--> Drew Barrymore, <!--del_lnk--> Scarlett Johansson, <!--del_lnk--> Justin Long, and <!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Connelly. The film generated mostly mixed reviews, but was a box office success, earning $165&nbsp;million worldwide. In <i>State of Play</i>, Affleck played Congressman Stephen Collins, an adaptation of the British television serial <i><!--del_lnk--> State of Play</i>. The film is a political thriller which raises questions about the relationship between politicians and the media. In the comedy film <i>Extract</i>, Affleck played Dean, a bartender, and the best friend to <!--del_lnk--> Jason Bateman's character. His performance in the film was well-received, with Barbara Vancheri of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i> reporting that "Affleck is a hoot as a long-haired fount of bad advice and drugs he keeps in a little tin behind the bar. After playing a square-jawed crimefighter, an actor turned Superman and a congressman, he is actually loose and funny."</p>
       <p>Affleck directed his second feature, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Town</i>, an adaptation of <!--del_lnk--> Chuck Hogan's novel <i>Prince of Thieves</i> that was both a critical and commercial success when it was released in theaters in 2010. Along with directing and co-writing the film, he was also a part of the cast that also includes <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe-winner <!--del_lnk--> Jon Hamm, the <a href="../../wp/a/Academy_Award.htm" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a>-nominated <!--del_lnk--> Jeremy Renner, the <a href="../../wp/a/Academy_Award.htm" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a>-winning actor <!--del_lnk--> Chris Cooper and <!--del_lnk--> Gossip Girl-actress <!--del_lnk--> Blake Lively.</p>
       <p>Affleck will star in an upcoming romantic drama written and directed by <!--del_lnk--> Terrence Malick, alongside <!--del_lnk--> Olga Kurylenko, <!--del_lnk--> Javier Bardem, <!--del_lnk--> Rachel McAdams and <!--del_lnk--> Rachel Weisz. Filming took place in fall 2010 in <!--del_lnk--> Bartlesville, Oklahoma.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_projects">Other projects</span></h2>
       <p>Affleck's support of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nonprofit_organization.htm" title="Non-profit">non-profit</a> organization, the A-T Children's Project, began after meeting Joe Kindregan while filming <i>Forces of Nature</i>. Kindregan, who was then nine years old, has the rare disease called <!--del_lnk--> ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). Affleck attends benefits and spoke to Congress to advocate for the A-T Children's Project. The disease, described as like having <!--del_lnk--> muscular dystrophy, <a href="../../wp/c/Cystic_fibrosis.htm" title="Cystic fibrosis">cystic fibrosis</a>, <!--del_lnk--> immune deficiency and <a href="../../wp/c/Cancer.htm" title="Cancer">cancer</a> all at once, is progressive; children with A-T usually do not live beyond their late teens. In 2007, Affleck was the keynote speaker at the graduation ceremony of Falls Church High School in Fairfax, Virginia, from which Kindregan was graduating.</p>
       <p>On June 23, 2008, he appeared in an ABC News exclusive exploring the humanitarian crisis in Congo. Affleck travelled to Congo and interviewed refugees, warlords, and members of parliament. "I think the more painful something is, the more you want to distance yourself from it," he said. "I think the hard part is actually to let some of that go and to realize that when you see some of these images of people suffering in some way or another, to kind of remember that these are people who are in fact just in different circumstance than you are, but that are kind of dealing with [those circumstances] in a pretty brave and enduring way."</p>
       <p>In December 2008, he teamed up with the United Nations releasing a short film highlighting the plight of refugees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
       <p>In March 2010, Affleck announced the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Congo Initiative, which he founded as "the first U.S. based advocacy and grant-making initiative wholly focused on working with and for the people of eastern Congo."</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
       <p>Affleck had a high-profile romance with actress <a href="../../wp/g/Gwyneth_Paltrow.htm" title="Gwyneth Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> in 1998, following her breakup with actor <a href="../../wp/b/Brad_Pitt.htm" title="Brad Pitt">Brad Pitt</a>. In 2002, he began dating actress/singer <!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Lopez, whom he had met prior to filming <i>Gigli</i>. The same year, his engagement to Lopez was announced, and the relationship between the two received much attention from the entertainment media, who dubbed the couple "<!--del_lnk--> Bennifer". Despite a wedding planned for September 14, the couple broke up in 2004, both blaming the media attention - including an alleged incident in which Affleck partied with <!--del_lnk--> Christian Slater and some <!--del_lnk--> lap dancers in Vancouver. The negative publicity and media attention carried over to the 2003 film <i>Gigli</i>, which also was a box office failure.</p>
       <p>He subsequently began seeing his <i><!--del_lnk--> Daredevil</i> co-star, actress <!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Garner, and the two were engaged after nine months of dating. Affleck and Garner were married on June 29, 2005 in <a href="../../wp/t/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands.htm" title="Turks and Caicos Islands">Turks and Caicos</a>, located in the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean. They have two daughters, Violet Anne, born on December 1, 2005 and Seraphina Rose Elizabeth, born on January 6, 2009. He has a holiday home in <!--del_lnk--> Savannah, Georgia, and the family was in Cambridge for the summer in 2006 while Affleck was directing <i><!--del_lnk--> Gone, Baby, Gone</i>.</p>
       <p>Affleck describes himself as a lapsed <!--del_lnk--> Protestant.</p>
       <p>Affleck entered <!--del_lnk--> alcohol rehab in 2001, with a spokesman for the actor saying that "Ben is a self-aware and smart man who had decided that a fuller life awaits him without alcohol."</p>
       <p>An avid poker player, Affleck has regularly entered local events. He has been tutored by poker professionals <!--del_lnk--> Amir Vahedi and <!--del_lnk--> Annie Duke, and won the California State Poker Championship on June 20, 2004, taking home the first prize of $356,000, which qualified him for the 2004 <!--del_lnk--> World Poker Tour final tournament. He is a fan of the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Red Sox, <!--del_lnk--> New England Patriots, <!--del_lnk--> Boston Celtics, and <!--del_lnk--> Boston Bruins.</p>
       <p>According to <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sunday Times</i>, Affleck was apparently circumcised in adulthood, after suffering injury during the filming of a movie; a doctor decided that removing his <!--del_lnk--> foreskin would be easier than repairing it. He has since made it known that he is against routine infant <!--del_lnk--> circumcision.</p>
       <p>Affleck got his first tattoo when he was sixteen. He now has about a half-dozen including a tattoo of a dolphin that was used to cover up a tattoo of his high school sweetheart's name. The tattoos have been done by numerous artists including <!--del_lnk--> Paul Timman. He quit <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tobacco_smoking.htm" title="Cigarette smoking">smoking</a> after starring in the <!--del_lnk--> 2007 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Smokin' Aces</i>, in which he was required to smoke heavily, and lost his taste for it after a week of chain-smoking for his role. According to People Magazine Affleck is considered to have one of the most beautiful noses in the world.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_activism">Political activism</span></h3>
       <p>In the final weeks of the <!--del_lnk--> 2000 Presidential campaign, Affleck promoted the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic ticket, supporting <!--del_lnk--> Al Gore and repeatedly delivering a get-out-the-vote plea: "It's very important to vote. The president will appoint three or four <a href="../../wp/s/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.htm" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> justices." During the final week of the race, Affleck &ndash; along with <!--del_lnk--> Helen Hunt, <!--del_lnk--> Martin Sheen, <!--del_lnk--> Rob Reiner and other actors &ndash; spent an hour at a phone bank calling registered Democrats. "People in my generation have a low voter turnout. One of the reasons that I'm here is to demonstrate that no matter who you are going to vote for&nbsp;... I think it's important to get involved and get out and vote," he told reporters. "But I'm going to tell people to vote for Gore."</p>
       <p>On October 28, 2000, Affleck flew with <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton.htm" title="Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, who was running for a <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">Senate</a> seat, to <!--del_lnk--> Ithaca, New York, where he introduced her at a <!--del_lnk--> Cornell University rally. He told the college crowd that Clinton had been advocating for women and working families since "<!--del_lnk--> Rick Lazio was running around the frat house in his underwear". Lazio, then a <!--del_lnk--> Long Island congressman, was Clinton's <!--del_lnk--> Republican opponent.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>On November 6, 2000, the final day of the campaign, he was one of several high-profile celebrities summoned to <!--del_lnk--> Miami Beach by <!--del_lnk--> Miramax Films boss <!--del_lnk--> Harvey Weinstein for a late-night Gore rally, just hours before polls opened nationwide. The Gore campaign's last event, a final effort to energize <!--del_lnk--> South Beach voters, did not end until about 1:00 a.m., but Affleck flew back to New York that morning and made a surprise live appearance on <i><!--del_lnk--> The Rosie O'Donnell Show</i>. It was 10:15 a.m. when he made his final public pitch from a <!--del_lnk--> Rockefeller Centre studio, noting that he was "a little bit tired&nbsp;... I've been out getting involved, doing stuff and trying to get people to vote. And that's why I came by here". Also, "Today is the get-out-the-vote day and&nbsp;... I think this is the time to get involved, especially the young folks who are here&nbsp;... I'm about to go vote," He then said, "I am personally gonna vote for Al Gore".</p>
       <p>As votes were tallied that night, Affleck told <!--del_lnk--> Salon.com's Amy Reiter, "I'm nervous this evening, but one of the things that's exciting to me is the number of people who voted. No matter who wins, I think it's a healthy thing for our country that so many voters have come out and participated in the process. Either way, I think the most important number will be the turnout".</p>
       <p>In the May 2001 issue of <i><!--del_lnk--> GQ</i>, Affleck said, "My fantasy is that someday I'm independently wealthy enough that I'm not beholden to anybody, so I can run for Congress on the grounds that everyday people should be in government". However, when he was asked about his political ambitions in an April 2009 interview to promote the 2009 film, <i><!--del_lnk--> State of Play</i>, Affleck said, "I really like my job that I have now. Plus, unlike in Hollywood where you need one director to hire you, in politics you have to have a lot of people to vote for you. I think it's harder work. I really am happy with what I'm doing now. In fact I've never been at a place where I've felt better about going to work everyday. I'm more engaged and very, very happy."</p>
       <p>In 2004, Affleck actively campaigned for Democratic presidential nominee <!--del_lnk--> John Kerry. During the first day of the <!--del_lnk--> 2004 Democratic National Convention, he was featured on <i><!--del_lnk--> Larry King Live</i> with <!--del_lnk--> Tucker Carlson and <!--del_lnk--> Al Sharpton. <!--del_lnk--> Larry King asked if he would consider running for office, and Affleck admitted to contemplating the proposition. Specific attention focused on whether he would run for Kerry's open Senate seat (as Affleck was from <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts). He noted that the line between politics and entertainment is becoming increasingly blurred, as political figures <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Arnold_Schwarzenegger.htm" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> both came from the entertainment business. On December 21, 2010, Ben Affleck appeared on NPR and criticized CEO's for making so much money. "And CEOs' pay shouldn't be 200 times the average worker. It used to be nine times." On November 4, 2010, Affleck was commended for returning a second check for $250,000 that was mistakenly sent to him for appearing at the opening of a casino at the Greenbriar resort.</p>
