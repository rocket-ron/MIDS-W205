       <p>The <b>Big Bang</b> theory is the prevailing <a href="../../wp/p/Physical_cosmology.htm" title="Physical cosmology">cosmological</a> model that describes the early development of the <a href="../../wp/u/Universe.htm" title="Universe">Universe</a>. According to the theory, the Big Bang occurred approximately 13.77 billion years ago, which is thus considered the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_the_universe.htm" title="Age of the universe">age of the universe</a>. After this time, the Universe was in an extremely hot and dense state and began <!--del_lnk--> expanding rapidly. After the initial expansion, the Universe cooled sufficiently to allow energy to be <!--del_lnk--> converted into various <!--del_lnk--> subatomic particles, including <a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">protons</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutrons</a>, and <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electrons</a>. Though simple atomic nuclei could have <!--del_lnk--> formed quickly, thousands of years were needed before the appearance of the first electrically neutral atoms. The first element produced was <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, along with traces of <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Lithium.htm" title="Lithium">lithium</a>. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a> to form <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Galaxy.htm" title="Galaxy">galaxies</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/p/Periodic_table.htm" title="Periodic table">heavier elements</a> were synthesized either <!--del_lnk--> within stars or <!--del_lnk--> during supernovae.</p>
       <p>The Big Bang is a well-tested <!--del_lnk--> scientific theory and is widely accepted within the scientific community. It offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the <!--del_lnk--> abundance of light elements, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background">cosmic microwave background</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Observable_universe.htm" title="Large-scale structure of the cosmos">large scale structure</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble diagram">Hubble diagram</a> for <!--del_lnk--> Type Ia supernovae. The core ideas of the Big Bang&mdash;the expansion, the early hot state, the formation of helium, and the formation of galaxies&mdash;are derived from these and other observations that are independent of any cosmological model. As the distance between galaxy clusters is increasing today, it is inferred that everything was closer together in the past. This idea has been considered in detail back in time to extreme <a href="../../wp/d/Density.htm" title="Density">densities</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Temperature.htm" title="Temperature">temperatures</a>, and large <!--del_lnk--> particle accelerators have been built to experiment in such conditions, resulting in further development of the model. On the other hand, these accelerators have limited capabilities to probe into such <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Particle_physics.htm" title="High-energy physics">high energy regimes</a>. There is little evidence regarding the absolute earliest instant of the expansion. Thus, the Big Bang theory cannot and does not provide any explanation for such an initial condition; rather, it describes and explains the general evolution of the universe going forward from that point on.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Georges Lema&icirc;tre first proposed what became the Big Bang theory in what he called his "hypothesis of the primeval atom." Over time, scientists built on his initial ideas to form the modern synthesis. The framework for the Big Bang model relies on <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s <a href="../../wp/g/General_relativity.htm" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> and on simplifying assumptions such as <!--del_lnk--> homogeneity and <!--del_lnk--> isotropy of space. The governing equations had been formulated by <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Friedmann. In 1929, <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Hubble discovered that the distances to far away <a href="../../wp/g/Galaxy.htm" title="Galaxy">galaxies</a> were generally <!--del_lnk--> proportional to their <a href="../../wp/r/Redshift.htm" title="Redshift">redshifts</a>&mdash;an idea originally suggested by Lema&icirc;tre in 1927. Hubble's observation was taken to indicate that all very distant galaxies and clusters have an apparent velocity directly away from our vantage point: the farther away, the higher the apparent velocity.</p>
       <p>While the scientific community was once divided between supporters of the Big Bang and those of the <!--del_lnk--> Steady State theory, most scientists became convinced that some version of the Big Bang scenario best fit observations after the discovery of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> in 1964, and especially when its spectrum (i.e., the amount of radiation measured at each wavelength) was found to match that of thermal radiation from a <!--del_lnk--> black body. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated a wide range of observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its <!--del_lnk--> parametrization as the <!--del_lnk--> Lambda-CDM model serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology.</p>

       <p>Extrapolation of the expansion of the Universe backwards in time using <a href="../../wp/g/General_relativity.htm" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> yields an infinite <a href="../../wp/d/Density.htm" title="Density">density</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Temperature.htm" title="Temperature">temperature</a> at a finite time in the past. This <!--del_lnk--> singularity signals the breakdown of general relativity. How closely we can extrapolate towards the singularity is debated&mdash;certainly no closer than the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Planck epoch. This singularity is sometimes called "the Big Bang", but the term can also refer to the early hot, dense phase itself, which can be considered the "birth" of our Universe. Based on measurements of the expansion using <!--del_lnk--> Type Ia supernovae, measurements of temperature fluctuations in the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background</a>, and measurements of the <!--del_lnk--> correlation function of galaxies, the Universe has a calculated age of 13.772 &plusmn; 0.059&nbsp;billion years. The agreement of these three independent measurements strongly supports the <!--del_lnk--> &Lambda;CDM model that describes in detail the contents of the Universe.</p>
       <p>The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the Universe was filled <!--del_lnk--> homogeneously and <!--del_lnk--> isotropically with an incredibly high <!--del_lnk--> energy density and huge <a href="../../wp/t/Temperature.htm" title="Temperature">temperatures</a> and <!--del_lnk--> pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10<sup>&minus;37</sup> seconds into the expansion, a <!--del_lnk--> phase transition caused a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Inflation_%2528cosmology%2529.htm" title="Cosmic inflation">cosmic inflation</a>, during which the Universe grew <a href="../../wp/e/Exponential_growth.htm" title="Exponential growth">exponentially</a>. After inflation stopped, the Universe consisted of a <!--del_lnk--> quark&ndash;gluon plasma, as well as all other <!--del_lnk--> elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special relativity">relativistic</a> <!--del_lnk--> speeds, and <!--del_lnk--> particle&ndash;antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point an unknown reaction called <!--del_lnk--> baryogenesis violated the conservation of <!--del_lnk--> baryon number, leading to a very small excess of <a href="../../wp/q/Quark.htm" title="Quark">quarks</a> and <!--del_lnk--> leptons over antiquarks and antileptons&mdash;of the order of one part in 30&nbsp;million. This resulted in the predominance of <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">matter</a> over <!--del_lnk--> antimatter in the present Universe.</p>

       <p>The Universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. <!--del_lnk--> Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the <!--del_lnk--> fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of <!--del_lnk--> elementary particles into their present form. After about 10<sup>&minus;11</sup> seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in <a href="../../wp/p/Particle_physics.htm" title="Particle physics">particle physics</a> experiments. At about 10<sup>&minus;6</sup> seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form <!--del_lnk--> baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton&ndash;antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons&ndash;antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10<sup>10</sup> of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the Universe was dominated by <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photons</a> (with a minor contribution from <!--del_lnk--> neutrinos).</p>
       <p>A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million; 10<sup>9</sup>; SI prefix <!--del_lnk--> giga-) <a href="../../wp/k/Kelvin.htm" title="Kelvin">kelvin</a> and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the Universe's <!--del_lnk--> deuterium and <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Atomic_nucleus.htm" title="Atomic nucleus">nuclei</a> in a process called <!--del_lnk--> Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Most protons remained uncombined as <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> nuclei. As the Universe cooled, the <!--del_lnk--> rest mass energy density of matter came to <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravitationally</a> dominate that of the photon <a href="../../wp/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.htm" title="Electromagnetic radiation">radiation</a>. After about 379,000 years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a>.</p>
       <p>Over a long period of time, the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a>, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the Universe. The four possible types of matter are known as <!--del_lnk--> cold dark matter, <!--del_lnk--> warm dark matter, <!--del_lnk--> hot dark matter, and <!--del_lnk--> baryonic matter. The best measurements available (from <!--del_lnk--> WMAP) show that the data is well-fit by a <!--del_lnk--> Lambda-CDM model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold (<!--del_lnk--> warm dark matter is ruled out by early <!--del_lnk--> reionization), and is estimated to make up about 23% of the matter/energy of the universe, while baryonic matter makes up about 4.6%. In an "extended model" which includes hot dark matter in the form of <!--del_lnk--> neutrinos, then if the "physical baryon density" &Omega;<sub>b</sub>h<sup>2</sup> is estimated at about 0.023 (this is different from the 'baryon density' &Omega;<sub>b</sub> expressed as a fraction of the total matter/energy density, which as noted above is about 0.046), and the corresponding cold dark matter density &Omega;<sub>c</sub>h<sup>2</sup> is about 0.11, the corresponding neutrino density &Omega;<sub>v</sub>h<sup>2</sup> is estimated to be less than 0.0062.</p>
       <p>Independent lines of evidence from <!--del_lnk--> Type Ia supernovae and the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">CMB</a> imply that the Universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as <!--del_lnk--> dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's Universe is in this form. When the Universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity had the upper hand, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble's law">expansion of the Universe</a> to slowly begin to accelerate. Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the <!--del_lnk--> cosmological constant term in <!--del_lnk--> Einstein's field equations of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its <!--del_lnk--> equation of state and relationship with the <a href="../../wp/s/Standard_Model.htm" title="Standard Model">Standard Model</a> of particle physics continue to be investigated both observationally and theoretically.</p>
       <p>All of this cosmic evolution after the <!--del_lnk--> inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the <!--del_lnk--> &Lambda;CDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. As noted above, there is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10<sup>&minus;15</sup> seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of <!--del_lnk--> quantum gravitation is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the Universe is currently one of the greatest <!--del_lnk--> unsolved problems in physics.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Underlying_assumptions">Underlying assumptions</span></h3>
       <p>The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of <!--del_lnk--> physical laws and the <!--del_lnk--> cosmological principle. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the Universe is <!--del_lnk--> homogeneous and <!--del_lnk--> isotropic.</p>
       <p>These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the <!--del_lnk--> fine structure constant over much of the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_the_universe.htm" title="Age of the universe">age of the universe</a> is of order 10<sup>&minus;5</sup>. Also, <a href="../../wp/g/General_relativity.htm" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> has passed stringent <!--del_lnk--> tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.</p>
       <p>If the large-scale Universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler <!--del_lnk--> Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10<sup>&minus;5</sup> via observations of the CMB. The Universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="FLRW_metric">FLRW metric</span></h3>
       <p>General relativity describes spacetime by a <!--del_lnk--> metric, which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, themselves are specified using a <!--del_lnk--> coordinate chart or "grid" that is laid down over all <!--del_lnk--> spacetime. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be <!--del_lnk--> homogeneous and <!--del_lnk--> isotropic on large scales, which uniquely singles out the <!--del_lnk--> Friedmann&ndash;Lema&icirc;tre&ndash;Robertson&ndash;Walker metric (FLRW metric). This metric contains a <!--del_lnk--> scale factor, which describes how the size of the Universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a <!--del_lnk--> coordinate system to be made, called <!--del_lnk--> comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system the grid expands along with the Universe, and objects that are moving only due to the expansion of the Universe remain at fixed points on the grid. While their <i>coordinate</i> distance (<!--del_lnk--> comoving distance) remains constant, the <i>physical</i> distance between two such comoving points expands proportionally with the <!--del_lnk--> scale factor of the Universe.</p>
       <p>The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, <!--del_lnk--> space itself expands with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our Universe only on large scales&mdash;local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Horizons">Horizons</span></h3>
       <p>An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Observable_universe.htm#Particle_horizon" title="Particle horizon">horizons</a>. Since the Universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a <i>past horizon</i> on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a <i>future horizon</i>, which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our Universe. Our understanding of the Universe back to very early times <a href="../../wp/b/Big_Bang.htm#Horizon_problem" title="Big Bang">suggests</a> that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the Universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the Universe continues to <!--del_lnk--> accelerate, there is a future horizon as well.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the Universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 <!--del_lnk--> Vesto Slipher measured the first <!--del_lnk--> Doppler shift of a "<!--del_lnk--> spiral nebula" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was <!--del_lnk--> highly controversial whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>. Ten years later, Alexander Friedmann, a <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Physical_cosmology.htm" title="Physical cosmology">cosmologist</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematician.htm" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a>, derived <!--del_lnk--> the Friedmann equations from <!--del_lnk--> Albert Einstein's equations of general relativity, showing that the Universe might be expanding in contrast to the <!--del_lnk--> static Universe model advocated by Einstein at that time. In 1924 Edwin Hubble's measurement of the great distance to the nearest spiral nebulae showed that these systems were indeed other galaxies. Independently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, <!--del_lnk--> Georges Lema&icirc;tre, a Belgian physicist and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> priest, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the Universe.</p>
       <p>In 1931 Lema&icirc;tre went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the Universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.</p>
       <p>Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the <!--del_lnk--> cosmic distance ladder, using the 100-inch (2,500&nbsp;mm) Hooker telescope at <!--del_lnk--> Mount Wilson Observatory. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose <a href="../../wp/r/Redshift.htm" title="Redshift">redshifts</a> had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity&mdash;now known as <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble's law">Hubble's law</a>. Lema&icirc;tre had already shown that this was expected, given the <!--del_lnk--> Cosmological Principle.</p>
       <p>In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal <!--del_lnk--> steady state Universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the <!--del_lnk--> steady state theory. This perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the Big Bang theory, Monsignor Georges Lema&icirc;tre, was a Roman Catholic priest. <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Eddington agreed with <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> that the universe did not have a beginning in time, viz., that <!--del_lnk--> matter is eternal. A beginning in time was "repugnant" to him. Lema&icirc;tre, however, thought that</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>If the world has begun with a single <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum</a>, the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta. If this suggestion is correct, the <!--del_lnk--> beginning of the world happened a little before the beginning of space and time.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>During the 1930s other ideas were proposed as <!--del_lnk--> non-standard cosmologies to explain Hubble's observations, including the <!--del_lnk--> Milne model, the <!--del_lnk--> oscillatory Universe (originally suggested by Friedmann, but advocated by Albert Einstein and <!--del_lnk--> Richard Tolman) and <!--del_lnk--> Fritz Zwicky's <!--del_lnk--> tired light hypothesis.</p>
       <p>After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, two distinct possibilities emerged. One was <!--del_lnk--> Fred Hoyle's <!--del_lnk--> steady state model, whereby new matter would be created as the Universe seemed to expand. In this model the Universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lema&icirc;tre's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by <!--del_lnk--> George Gamow, who introduced <!--del_lnk--> big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and whose associates, <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Alpher and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Herman, predicted the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> (CMB). Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lema&icirc;tre's theory, referring to it as "this <i>big bang</i> idea" during a <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio <!--del_lnk--> source counts, began to favour Big Bang over Steady State. The discovery and confirmation of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the Universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.</p>
       <p>Significant progress in Big Bang cosmology have been made since the late 1990s as a result of advances in <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescope</a> technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as <!--del_lnk--> COBE, the <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble_Space_Telescope.htm" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and <!--del_lnk--> WMAP. Cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the Universe appears to be accelerating.</p>

       <p>Observations of distant galaxies and <!--del_lnk--> quasars show that these objects are <a href="../../wp/r/Redshift.htm" title="Redshift">redshifted</a>&mdash;the <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a> emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a <!--del_lnk--> frequency spectrum of an object and matching the <a href="../../wp/s/Spectroscopy.htm" title="Spectroscopy">spectroscopic</a> pattern of <!--del_lnk--> emission lines or <!--del_lnk--> absorption lines corresponding to <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a> of the <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_element.htm" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a> interacting with the light. These redshifts are <!--del_lnk--> uniformly <!--del_lnk--> isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the <a href="../../wp/r/Redshift.htm" title="Redshift">redshift</a> is interpreted as a <!--del_lnk--> Doppler shift, the recessional <a href="../../wp/v/Velocity.htm" title="Velocity">velocity</a> of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the <!--del_lnk--> cosmic distance ladder. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble's law">Hubble's law</a> is observed:</p>

       </ul>
       <p><a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble's law">Hubble's law</a> has two possible explanations. Either we are at the centre of an explosion of galaxies&mdash;which is untenable given the <!--del_lnk--> Copernican principle&mdash;or the Universe is <!--del_lnk--> uniformly expanding everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from <a href="../../wp/g/General_relativity.htm" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and <!--del_lnk--> Georges Lema&icirc;tre in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by <!--del_lnk--> Friedmann, Lema&icirc;tre, Robertson, and Walker.</p>
       <p>The theory requires the relation <i>v</i> = <i>HD</i> to hold at all times, where <i>D</i> is the <!--del_lnk--> comoving distance, <i>v</i> is the <!--del_lnk--> recessional velocity, and <i>v</i>, <i>H</i>, and <i>D</i> vary as the Universe expands (hence we write <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Observable_universe.htm" title="Observable Universe">observable Universe</a>, the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity <i>v</i>. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the Universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.</p>
       <p>That <!--del_lnk--> space is undergoing metric expansion is shown by direct observational evidence of the <!--del_lnk--> Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical <a href="../../wp/r/Redshift.htm" title="Redshift">redshifts</a> are extremely <!--del_lnk--> isotropic and <!--del_lnk--> homogenous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the Universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a centre distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.</p>
       <p>Measurements of the effects of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the Universe. Uniform cooling of the cosmic microwave background over billions of years is explainable only if the Universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique centre of an explosion.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Abundance_of_primordial_elements">Abundance of primordial elements</span></h3>
       <p>Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of <!--del_lnk--> helium-4, <!--del_lnk--> helium-3, <!--del_lnk--> deuterium, and <!--del_lnk--> lithium-7 in the Universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen.

       <p>The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:0.8em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:85%; text-align:right;">4</span>He</span>, and off by a factor of two <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:0.8em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:85%; text-align:right;">7</span>Li</span>; in the latter two cases there are substantial <!--del_lnk--> systematic uncertainties. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20&ndash;30% helium. Indeed there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young Universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of <!--del_lnk--> stellar nucleosynthesis products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than <span class="unicode" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:0.8em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:85%; text-align:right;">3</span>He</span>, and in constant ratios, too.</p>

A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then larger structures have been forming, such as <!--del_lnk--> galaxy clusters and <!--del_lnk--> superclusters. Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early Universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of <!--del_lnk--> star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the Universe and are helping to complete details of the theory.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Primordial_gas_clouds">Primordial gas clouds</span></h3>
       <p>In 2011 astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas, by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium.  Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during <!--del_lnk--> Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Their composition matches the composition predicted from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. This provides direct evidence that there was a period in the history of the universe before the formation of the first stars, when most ordinary matter existed in the form of clouds of neutral hydrogen.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_lines_of_evidence">Other lines of evidence</span></h3>
       <p>The age of Universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">CMB</a> is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of <!--del_lnk--> stellar evolution to <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Globular_cluster.htm" title="Globular clusters">globular clusters</a> and through <!--del_lnk--> radiometric dating of individual <!--del_lnk--> Population II stars.</p>
       <p>The prediction that the CMB temperature was higher in the past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the <!--del_lnk--> Sunyaev&ndash;Zel'dovich effect in <!--del_lnk--> clusters of galaxies does not depend directly on redshift. Observations have found this to be roughly true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.</p>

       <p>It is not yet understood why the Universe has more <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">matter</a> than <!--del_lnk--> antimatter.

However, observations suggest that the Universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called <!--del_lnk--> baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the <!--del_lnk--> Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that <!--del_lnk--> baryon number is not conserved, that <!--del_lnk--> C-symmetry and <!--del_lnk--> CP-symmetry are violated and that the Universe depart from <!--del_lnk--> thermodynamic equilibrium.

       <p>Measurements of the <a href="../../wp/r/Redshift.htm" title="Redshift">redshift</a>&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> magnitude relation for <!--del_lnk--> type Ia supernovae indicate that the expansion of the Universe has been <!--del_lnk--> accelerating since the Universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, <a href="../../wp/g/General_relativity.htm" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> requires that much of the energy in the Universe consists of a component with large <!--del_lnk--> negative pressure, dubbed "<!--del_lnk--> dark energy". Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background">cosmic microwave background</a> indicate that the Universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the Universe must have almost exactly the <!--del_lnk--> critical density of mass/energy. But the <a href="../../wp/d/Density.htm" title="Density">mass density</a> of the Universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density. Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the Universe, one using the frequency of <!--del_lnk--> gravitational lenses, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Observable_universe.htm" title="Large-scale structure of the universe">large-scale structure</a> as a cosmic ruler.</p>
       <p>Negative pressure is believed to be a property of <!--del_lnk--> vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Possible candidates include a <!--del_lnk--> cosmological constant and <!--del_lnk--> quintessence. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the Universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the Universe expands. Therefore matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the Universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.</p>

       <p>During the 1970s and 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the Universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the Universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal <!--del_lnk--> baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the Universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the Universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less <!--del_lnk--> deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, <!--del_lnk--> galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, <!--del_lnk--> gravitational lensing studies, and <!--del_lnk--> X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.</p>
       <p>Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many <a href="../../wp/p/Particle_physics.htm" title="Particle physics">particle physics</a> candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Globular_cluster_age">Globular cluster age</span></h3>
       <p>In the mid-1990s observations of <a href="../../wp/g/Globular_cluster.htm" title="Globular cluster">globular clusters</a> appeared to be inconsistent with the Big Bang theory. Computer simulations that matched the observations of the <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stellar</a> populations of globular clusters suggested that they were about 15&nbsp;billion years old, which conflicted with the 13.77&nbsp;billion year age of the Universe. This issue was partially resolved in the late 1990s when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to <!--del_lnk--> stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters. There remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, but it is clear that observations of globular clusters no longer appear inconsistent with the Big Bang theory.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Problems">Problems</span></h2>
       <p>There are generally considered to be three outstanding problems with the Big Bang theory: the <!--del_lnk--> horizon problem, the <!--del_lnk--> flatness problem, and the <!--del_lnk--> magnetic monopole problem. The most common answer to these problems is <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Inflation_%2528cosmology%2529.htm" title="Cosmic inflation">inflationary theory</a>; however, since this creates new problems, other options have been proposed, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Weyl curvature hypothesis.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Horizon_problem">Horizon problem</span></h3>
       <p>The horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel <!--del_lnk--> faster than light. In a Universe of finite age this sets a limit&mdash;the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Observable_universe.htm" title="Particle horizon">particle horizon</a>&mdash;on the separation of any two regions of space that are in <!--del_lnk--> causal contact. The observed isotropy of the CMB is problematic in this regard: if the Universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.</p>
       <p>A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Inflation_%2528cosmology%2529.htm" title="Inflationary theory">inflationary theory</a> in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the Universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the Universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable Universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Heisenberg's uncertainty principle predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be <!--del_lnk--> quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the Universe. Inflation predicts that the <!--del_lnk--> primordial fluctuations are nearly <!--del_lnk--> scale invariant and <a href="../../wp/n/Normal_distribution.htm" title="Normal distribution">Gaussian</a>, which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.</p>
       <p>If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Flatness_problem">Flatness problem</span></h3>

Shown from top to bottom are a <!--del_lnk--> closed Universe with positive curvature, a <!--del_lnk--> hyperbolic Universe with negative curvature and a <!--del_lnk--> flat Universe with zero curvature.</div>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The flatness problem (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a <!--del_lnk--> Friedmann&ndash;Lema&icirc;tre&ndash;Robertson&ndash;Walker metric. The Universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial <!--del_lnk--> curvature depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the <!--del_lnk--> critical density, positive if greater, and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be <i>flat</i>. The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the Universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the <!--del_lnk--> Planck time, 10<sup>&minus;43</sup> seconds, the fact that the Universe has reached neither a <!--del_lnk--> heat death nor a <!--del_lnk--> Big Crunch after billions of years requires some explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the Universe density must have been within one part in 10<sup>14</sup> of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.</p>
       <p>A resolution to this problem is offered by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Inflation_%2528cosmology%2529.htm" title="Inflationary theory">inflationary theory</a>. During the inflationary period, spacetime expanded to such an extent that its <!--del_lnk--> curvature would have been smoothed out. Thus, it is theorized that inflation drove the Universe to a very nearly spatially flat state, with almost exactly the critical density.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Magnetic_monopoles">Magnetic monopoles</span></h3>
       <p>The magnetic monopole objection was raised in the late 1970s. <!--del_lnk--> Grand unification theories predicted <!--del_lnk--> topological defects in space that would manifest as <!--del_lnk--> magnetic monopoles. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early Universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that searches have never found any monopoles. This problem is also resolved by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Inflation_%2528cosmology%2529.htm" title="Cosmic inflation">cosmic inflation</a>, which removes all point defects from the observable Universe in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_future_according_to_the_Big_Bang_theory">The future according to the Big Bang theory</span></h2>
       <p>Before observations of <!--del_lnk--> dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the Universe. If the mass <a href="../../wp/d/Density.htm" title="Density">density</a> of the Universe were greater than the <!--del_lnk--> critical density, then the Universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started&mdash;a <!--del_lnk--> Big Crunch. Alternatively, if the density in the Universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out leaving <a href="../../wp/w/White_dwarf.htm" title="White dwarf">white dwarfs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> neutron stars, and <a href="../../wp/b/Black_hole.htm" title="Black hole">black holes</a>. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the Universe would asymptotically approach <a href="../../wp/a/Absolute_zero.htm" title="Absolute zero">absolute zero</a>&mdash;a <!--del_lnk--> Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were <!--del_lnk--> unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting <a href="../../wp/h/Hawking_radiation.htm" title="Hawking radiation">Hawking radiation</a>. The <a href="../../wp/e/Entropy.htm" title="Entropy">entropy</a> of the Universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as <!--del_lnk--> heat death.</p>
       <p>Modern observations of <!--del_lnk--> accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible Universe will pass beyond our <!--del_lnk--> event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The <!--del_lnk--> &Lambda;CDM model of the Universe contains <!--del_lnk--> dark energy in the form of a <!--del_lnk--> cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the Universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called <!--del_lnk--> phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately <!--del_lnk--> galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called <!--del_lnk--> Big Rip.</p>

       <p>While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined in the future. Little is known about the earliest moments of the Universe's history. The equations of classical <a href="../../wp/g/General_relativity.htm" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> indicate a <!--del_lnk--> singularity at the origin of cosmic time, although this conclusion depends on several assumptions. Moreover, general relativity must break down before the Universe reaches the <!--del_lnk--> Planck temperature, and a correct treatment of <!--del_lnk--> quantum gravity may avoid the would-be singularity.</p>
       <p>Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Models including the <!--del_lnk--> Hartle&ndash;Hawking no-boundary condition in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time, but without the need for a singularity.</li>
        <li>Big Bang lattice model states that the Universe at the moment of the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of <!--del_lnk--> fermions which is smeared over the <!--del_lnk--> fundamental domain so it has both rotational, translational, and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Brane cosmology models in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in <a href="../../wp/s/String_theory.htm" title="String theory">string theory</a>; the pre-Big Bang model; the <!--del_lnk--> ekpyrotic model, in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes; and the <!--del_lnk--> cyclic model, a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a <!--del_lnk--> Big Crunch and the Universe endlessly cycles from one process to the other.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Eternal inflation, in which universal inflation ends locally here and there in a random fashion, each end-point leading to a <i>bubble universe</i> expanding from its own big bang.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Proposals in the last two categories see the Big Bang as an event in either a much larger and older Universe, or in a <!--del_lnk--> multiverse.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religious_and_philosophical_interpretations">Religious and philosophical interpretations</span></h2>
       <p>As a theory relevant to the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it has become one of the liveliest areas in the discourse between <!--del_lnk--> science and religion. Some believe the Big Bang implies a creator, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.</p>
