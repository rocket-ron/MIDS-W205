Before becoming Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea's <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the United Nations. He entered <!--del_lnk--> diplomatic service the year he graduated from university, accepting his first post in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/New_Delhi.htm" title="New Delhi, India">New Delhi, India</a>. In the foreign ministry, he established a reputation for modesty and competence.</p>
       <p>Ban was the <!--del_lnk--> foreign minister of <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> from January 2004 to November 2006. In February 2006, he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General. Ban was initially considered to be a long shot for the office. As foreign minister of South Korea, however, he was able to travel to all of the countries that were members of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_Security_Council.htm" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, a maneuver that turned him into the front runner.</p>
       <p>On 11 October 2006, he was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_General_Assembly.htm" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> and officially succeeded Annan on 1 January 2007. Ban has led several major reforms regarding peacekeeping and UN employment practices. Diplomatically, Ban has taken particularly strong views on <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/War_in_Darfur.htm" title="Darfur conflict">Darfur</a>, where he helped persuade Sudanese President <!--del_lnk--> Omar al-Bashir to allow peacekeeping troops to enter <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>; and on <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, pressing the issue repeatedly with former U.S. President <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. Ban has received strong criticism from <!--del_lnk--> OIOS, the UN internal audit unit, stating that the secretariat, under Ban's leadership, is "drifting into irrelevance".</p>
       <p>In 2011, Ban ran unopposed for a second term as Secretary-General. On 21 June 2011, he was unanimously re-elected by the General Assembly and therefore will continue to serve until 31 December 2016.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life_and_education">Early life and education</span></h2>
       <p>Ban was born in a small farming village in <!--del_lnk--> North Chungcheong Province, in June 1944. His family then moved to the nearby town of <!--del_lnk--> Chungju, where he grew up. During Ban's childhood, his father had a warehouse business, but the warehouse went bankrupt and the family lost its middle-class standard of living. When Ban was six, his family fled to a remote mountainside for much of the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War. After the war ended, his family returned to <!--del_lnk--> Chungju. Ban has mentioned meeting <!--del_lnk--> American soldiers at this time.</p>
       <p>In secondary school (<!--del_lnk--> Chungju High School), Ban became a star student, particularly in his studies of the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a>. In 1952, he was selected by his class to address a message to then UN Secretary-General <!--del_lnk--> Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld, but it is unknown if the message was ever sent. <!--del_lnk--> Dag Hammarskjold did not become Secretary-General until 1953. In 1962, Ban won an essay contest sponsored by the <a href="../../wp/i/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement.htm" title="International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement">Red Cross</a> and earned a trip to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> where he lived in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco.htm" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a> with a host family for several months. As part of the trip, Ban met U.S. President <a href="../../wp/j/John_F._Kennedy.htm" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. When a journalist at the meeting asked Ban what he wanted to be when he grew up, he said, "I want to become a diplomat."</p>
       <p>He received a <!--del_lnk--> bachelor's degree in <a href="../../wp/i/International_relations.htm" title="International relations">international relations</a> from <!--del_lnk--> Seoul National University in 1970, and earned a <!--del_lnk--> Master of Public Administration from the <!--del_lnk--> John F. Kennedy School of Government at <!--del_lnk--> Harvard University in 1985. At Harvard, he studied under <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Nye who remarked that Ban had "a rare combination of analytic clarity, humility and perseverance." Ban was awarded the degree of <!--del_lnk--> Doctor of Laws (Honoris Causa) by the <!--del_lnk--> University of Malta on 22 April 2009. He further received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the <!--del_lnk--> University of Washington in October 2009.</p>
       <p>In addition to his native <!--del_lnk--> Korean, Ban speaks <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>. There have been questions, however, regarding the extent of his knowledge of French, one of the two <!--del_lnk--> working languages of the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Secretariat.</p>

       <p>After graduating from university, Ban received the top score on Korea's foreign service exam. He joined the <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 1970, and worked his way up the career ladder during the years of the <!--del_lnk--> Yusin Constitution.</p>
       <p>Ban's first overseas posting was to <a href="../../wp/n/New_Delhi.htm" title="New Delhi">New Delhi, India</a>, where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence. Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the more prestigious United States, because in India he would be able to save more money, and send more money home to his family. In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea became a full UN member-state on 17 September 1991). After <!--del_lnk--> Park Chung-hee's 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.</p>
       <p>In 1980 Ban became director of the United Nations' International Organizations and Treaties Bureau, headquartered in <a href="../../wp/s/Seoul.htm" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>. He has been posted twice to the South Korean embassy in <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990&ndash;1992. In 1992, he became Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and <a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the <!--del_lnk--> Korean Peninsula. From 1993&ndash;1994 Ban was Korea's deputy ambassador to the United States. He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995 and then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996. Ban's lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea's unforgiving political environment.</p>
       <p>Ban was appointed <!--del_lnk--> Ambassador to <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Slovenia.htm" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> in 1998, and a year later he was also elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the <!--del_lnk--> Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO PrepCom). During the negotiations, in what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career, he included in a public letter a positive statement about the <!--del_lnk--> Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2001, not long after the United States had decided to abandon the treaty. To avoid anger from the United States, Ban was fired by President <!--del_lnk--> Kim Dae-jung, who also issued a public apology for Ban's statement.</p>
       <p>Ban was unemployed for the only time in his career and was expecting to receive an assignment to work in a remote and unimportant embassy. In 2001, during the 56th Session of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_General_Assembly.htm" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a>, South Korea held the rotating presidency, and to Ban's surprise, he was selected to be the chief of staff to general assembly president <!--del_lnk--> Han Seung-soo. In 2003, incoming president <!--del_lnk--> Roh Moo-hyun selected Ban as one of his foreign policy advisors.</p>

       </div>
       <p>In 2004, Ban replaced <!--del_lnk--> Yoon Young-Kwan as foreign minister of South Korea under president <!--del_lnk--> Roh Moo-hyun. At the beginning of his term, Ban was faced with two major crises: in June 2004 <!--del_lnk--> Kim Sun-il, a Korean translator, was kidnapped and killed in Iraq by <!--del_lnk--> Islamic extremists; and in December 2004 dozens of Koreans died in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean tsunami</a>. Ban survived scrutiny from lawmakers and saw an upturn in his popularity when talks began with North Korea. Ban became actively involved in issues relating to inter-Korean relationships. In September 2005, as <!--del_lnk--> foreign minister, he played a leading role in the diplomatic efforts to adopt the Joint Statement on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue at the Fourth Round of the <a href="../../wp/s/Six-party_talks.htm" title="Six-party talks">Six-party talks</a> held in <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>.</p>
       <p>As foreign minister, Ban oversaw the trade and aid policies of South Korea. This work put Ban in the position of signing trade deals and delivering foreign assistance to diplomats who would later be influential in his candidacy for Secretary-General. For example, Ban became the first senior South Korean minister to travel to the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_the_Congo.htm" title="Republic of the Congo">Republic of the Congo</a> since its independence in 1960.</p>

       <p>In February 2006, Ban declared his candidacy to replace <a href="../../wp/k/Kofi_Annan.htm" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a> as UN Secretary-General at the end of 2006, becoming the first South Korean to run for the office. Though Ban was the first to announce a candidacy, he was not originally considered a serious contender.</p>
       <p>Over the next eight months, Ban made ministerial visits to each of the 15 countries with a seat on the Security Council. Of the seven candidates, he topped each of the four <!--del_lnk--> straw polls conducted by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_Security_Council.htm" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a>: on 24 July, 14 September, 28 September, and 2 October.</p>
       <p>During the period in which these polls took place, Ban made major speeches to the <!--del_lnk--> Asia Society and the <!--del_lnk--> Council on Foreign Relations in <!--del_lnk--> New York. To be confirmed, Ban needed not only to win the support of the diplomatic community, but also to be able to avoid a veto from any of the five permanent members of the council: <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Ban was popular in Washington for having pushed to send South Korean troops to Iraq, and had the support of the <!--del_lnk--> Bush administration as he pursued the position. But Ban also opposed several U.S. positions: he expressed his support for the <!--del_lnk--> International Criminal Court and favoured an entirely non-confrontational approach to dealing with North Korea. Ban said during his campaign that he would like to visit North Korea in person to meet with <!--del_lnk--> Kim Jong-il directly. Ban was viewed as a stark contrast from Kofi Annan, who was considered charismatic, but perceived as a weak manager because of problems surrounding the UN's oil-for-food program in <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>.</p>
       <p>Ban struggled to win the approval of France. His official biography states that he speaks both <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, the two working languages of the UN Secretariat. He has repeatedly struggled to answer questions in French from journalists. Ban has repeatedly acknowledged his limitations at French, but assured French diplomats that he was devoted to continuing his study. At a press conference on 11 January 2007, Ban remarked, "My French perhaps could be improved, and I am continuing to work. I have taken French lessons over the last few months. I think that, even if my French isn't perfect, I will continue to study it."</p>
       <p>As the Secretary-General election drew closer, there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Ban's behalf. Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging <!--del_lnk--> aid to <!--del_lnk--> developing countries were the focus of many news articles. According to <i><!--del_lnk--> The Washington Post</i>, "rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea, which has the world's 11th-largest economy, has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy." Ban reportedly said that these insinuations were "groundless." In an interview on 17 September 2006 he stated: "As front-runner, I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process," and "I am a man of integrity."</p>
       <p>In the final informal poll on 2 October, Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention ("no opinion") from the fifteen members of the Security Council. The one abstention came from the Japanese delegation, who <!--del_lnk--> vehemently opposed the idea of a Korean taking the role of Secretary-General. Due to the overwhelming support of Ban by the rest of the Security Council, Japan later voted in favour of Ban to avoid controversy. More importantly, Ban was the only one to escape a veto; each of the other candidates received at least one "no" vote from among the five permanent members. After the vote, Shashi Tharoor, who finished second, withdrew his candidacy and China's <!--del_lnk--> Permanent Representative told the UN told reporters that "it is quite clear from today's straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly."</p>
       <p>On 9 October, the Security Council formally chose Ban as its nominee. In the public vote, he was supported by all 15 members of the council. On 13 October, the 192-member <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_General_Assembly.htm" title="United Nations General Assembly">General Assembly</a> <!--del_lnk--> acclaimed Ban as Secretary-General.</p>

       <p>When Ban became Secretary-General, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Economist</i> listed the major challenges facing him in 2007: "rising nuclear demons in <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> and North Korea, a haemorrhaging wound in <!--del_lnk--> Darfur, unending violence in the Middle East, looming environmental disaster, escalating international terrorism, the proliferation of <!--del_lnk--> weapons of mass destruction, the spread of HIV/AIDS. And then the more parochial concerns, such as the largely unfinished business of the most sweeping attempt at reform in the UN's history." Before starting, Kofi Annan shared the story that when the first Secretary-General <!--del_lnk--> Trygve Lie left office, he told his successor, <!--del_lnk--> Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld, "You are about to take over the most impossible job on earth."</p>
       <p>On 23 January 2007 Ban took office as the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations. Ban's term as Secretary-General opened with a flap. At his first encounter with the press as Secretary-General on 2 January 2007, he refused to condemn the <!--del_lnk--> death penalty imposed on <!--del_lnk--> Saddam Hussein by the Iraqi High Tribunal, remarking that "The issue of capital punishment is for each and every member State to decide". Ban's statements contradicted long-standing United Nations opposition to the death penalty as a human-rights concern. He quickly clarified his stance in the case of <!--del_lnk--> Barzan al-Tikriti and <!--del_lnk--> Awad al-Bandar, two top officials who were convicted of the deaths of 148 <!--del_lnk--> Shia Muslims in the Iraqi village of <!--del_lnk--> Dujail in the 1980s. In a statement through his spokesperson on 6 January, he "strongly urged the Government of Iraq to grant a stay of execution to those whose death sentences may be carried out in the near future." On the broader issue, he told a Washington, D.C., audience on 16 January 2007 that he recognized and encouraged the "growing trend in international society, international law and domestic policies and practices to phase out eventually the death penalty."</p>
       <p>On the tenth anniversary of <!--del_lnk--> Khmer Rouge leader <!--del_lnk--> Pol Pot's death, 15 April 2008, Ban Ki-moon appealed for the senior leaders of the regime to be brought to justice. The <!--del_lnk--> Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia-tribunal, which was established by both the United Nations and <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> and which became operational in 2006, is expected to continue until at least 2010.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cabinet">Cabinet</span></h4>
       <p>In early January, Ban appointed the key members of his cabinet. As his <!--del_lnk--> Deputy Secretary-General, he selected <a href="../../wp/t/Tanzania.htm" title="Tanzania">Tanzanian</a> foreign minister and professor <!--del_lnk--> Asha-Rose Migiro &ndash; a move that pleased African diplomats who had concerns of losing power without Annan in office.</p>
       <p>The top position devoted exclusively to management, Under-Secretary-General for Management, was filled by <!--del_lnk--> Alicia B&aacute;rcena Ibarra of Mexico. B&aacute;rcena was considered a UN insider, having previously served as Annan's chief of staff. Her appointment was seen by critics as an indication that Ban would not make dramatic changes to UN bureaucracy. Ban appointed <!--del_lnk--> Sir John Holmes, the British Ambassador to France, as <!--del_lnk--> Under-Secretary-General for humanitarian affairs and coordinator of emergency relief.</p>
       <p>Ban initially said that he would delay making other appointments until his first round of reforms were approved, but he later abandoned this idea after receiving criticism. In February he continued with appointments, selecting <!--del_lnk--> B. Lynn Pascoe, the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, to become Under-Secretary-General for political affairs. <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Marie Gu&eacute;henno, a French diplomat, who had served as Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping operations under Annan, remained in office. Ban selected <!--del_lnk--> Vijay K. Nambiar as his chief of staff.</p>
       <p>The appointment of many women to top jobs was seen as fulfilling a campaign promise Ban had made to increase the role of women in the United Nations. During Ban's first year as Secretary-General, more top jobs were being handled by women than ever before. Though not appointed by Ban, the president of the General Assembly, <!--del_lnk--> Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, is only the third woman to hold this position in UN history.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Reform_agenda">Reform agenda</span></h4>
       <p>During his first month in office, Ban proposed two major restructurings: to split the UN peacekeeping operation into two departments and to combine the political affairs and disarmament department. His proposals were met with stiff resistance from members of the UN General Assembly who bristled under Ban's request for rapid approval. The proposed merger of the disarmament and political affairs offices was criticized by many in the developing world, partially because of rumours that Ban hoped to place American B. Lynn Pascoe in charge of the new office. <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro D. Wolff, then acting American ambassador, said the United States backed his proposals.</p>
       <p>After the early bout of reproach, Ban began extensive consultation with UN ambassadors, agreeing to have his peacekeeping proposal extensively vetted. After the consultations, Ban dropped his proposal to combine political affairs and disarmament. Ban nevertheless pressed ahead with reforms on job requirements at the UN requiring that all positions be considered five-year appointments, all receive strict annual performance reviews, and all financial disclosures be made public. Though unpopular in the New York office, the move was popular in other UN offices around the world and lauded by UN observers. Ban's proposal to split the peacekeeping operation into one group handling operations and another handling arms was finally adopted in mid-March 2007.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Key_issues">Key issues</span></h4>
       <p>The Secretary-General of the United Nations has the ability to influence debate on nearly any global issue. Although unsuccessful in some areas, Ban's predecessor Annan had been successful in increasing the UN peacekeeping presence and in popularizing the <!--del_lnk--> Millennium Development Goals. UN observers were eager to see on which issues Ban intends to focus, in addition to reform of the United Nations bureaucracy.</p>
       <p>On several prominent issues, such as proliferation in Iran and North Korea, Ban has deferred to the Security Council. In 2007, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nauru.htm" title="Republic of Nauru">Republic of Nauru</a> raised the issue of allowing the Republic of China (Taiwan) to sign the <!--del_lnk--> Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Ban referenced the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, and refused the motion. On 19 July 2007, Taiwanese President <!--del_lnk--> Chen Shui-bian wrote to request admission into the UN by the name Taiwan. Ban rejected the request.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Ban early on identified <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a> as one of the key issues of his administration. In a <!--del_lnk--> White House meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush in January, Ban urged Bush to take steps to curb <a href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_gas.htm" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions. On 1 March 2007 in a speech before the UN General Assembly, Ban emphasized his concerns about global warming. Ban stated, "For my generation, coming of age at the height of the Cold War, fear of <!--del_lnk--> nuclear winter seemed the leading <!--del_lnk--> existential threat on the horizon. But the danger posed by war to all humanity &mdash; and to our planet &mdash; is at least matched by <a href="../../wp/c/Climate_change.htm" title="Climate change">climate change</a>" (referring to <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global Warming">Global Warming</a>, see <!--del_lnk--> P:GW portal). On 3 September 2009 he further emphasized his concerns at the World Climate Conference in Geneva, when he stated, "Our foot is stuck on the accelerator and we are heading towards an abyss".</p>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Middle_East">Middle East</span></h5>
       <p>On Thursday, 22 March 2007, while Ban was taking part in the first stop of a tour of the Middle East, a mortar attack hit just 80 meters (260&nbsp;ft) from where the Secretary-General was standing, interrupting a press conference in <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> Green Zone, and visibly shaking Ban and others. No one was hurt in the incident. The United Nations had already limited its role in Iraq after its Baghdad headquarters was bombed in August 2003, killing 22 people. Ban said, however, that he still hoped to find a way for the United Nations to "do more for Iraqi social and political development."</p>
       <p>On his trip, Ban visited <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>, the <a href="../../wp/w/West_Bank.htm" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, where Ban attended a conference with leaders of the <a href="../../wp/a/Arab_League.htm" title="Arab League">Arab League</a> and met for several hours with <!--del_lnk--> Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese president who had resisted UN peacekeepers in Darfur. While Ban met with <a href="../../wp/m/Mahmoud_Abbas.htm" title="Mahmoud Abbas">Mahmoud Abbas</a>, the Palestinian president, he declined to meet with <!--del_lnk--> Ismail Haniya of <!--del_lnk--> Hamas.</p>
       <p>Ban Ki-moon criticized Israel on 10 March 2008 for planning to build housing units in a <!--del_lnk--> West Bank settlement, saying the decision conflicts with "Israel's obligation under the road map" for Middle East peace.</p>
       <p>During a meeting of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_Security_Council.htm" title="UN Security Council">UN Security Council</a> on Wednesday, 7 January 2009, Ban called for an immediate end to fighting in the <a href="../../wp/g/Gaza_Strip.htm" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a>. He criticized both sides, Israel for bombarding <!--del_lnk--> Gaza and Hamas for firing rockets into Israel.</p>
       <p>Although the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 Iranian presidential election was widely disputed, Ban Ki-moon sent a traditional congratulation message to the Iranian president upon his inauguration. He kept silent over the request of <!--del_lnk--> Shirin Ebadi to visit Iran after the crackdown on peaceful post-election protests by the Iranian police &ndash; an event that was perceived by some as a <!--del_lnk--> crime against humanity . More than 4000 people were arrested and nearly 70 were killed, some while being held in prison. In another incident, several prominent intellectuals including <!--del_lnk--> Akbar Ganji, Hamid Dabashi, <a href="../../wp/n/Noam_Chomsky.htm" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> went on a three-day hunger strike in front of the UN. The incident was followed by an official request by more than 200 intellectuals, human rights activists and reformist politicians in Iran for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="UN">UN</a> reaction. Ban Ki-moon however did not take any action to stop the violence in Iran.</p>
       <p>On 9 May 2012 Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon expressed his concern about the condition of the Palestinian <!--del_lnk--> hunger strikers in Israeli prisons.</p>
       <p>On 30 August 2012 Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon criticized the Iranian leadership due to their statements regarding Israel's destruction and denying the Holocaust.</p>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Darfur">Darfur</span></h5>
       <p>Ban took the first foreign trip of his term to attend the <a href="../../wp/a/African_Union.htm" title="African Union">African Union</a> summit in <a href="../../wp/a/Addis_Ababa.htm" title="Addis Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, in January 2007 as part of an effort to reach out to the <!--del_lnk--> Group of 77. He repeatedly identified Darfur as the top humanitarian priority of his administration. Ban played a large role, with several face-to-face meetings with <!--del_lnk--> Sudanese President <!--del_lnk--> Omar Hassan al-Bashir, in convincing Sudan to allow UN peacekeepers to enter the Darfur region. On 31 July 2007 the United Nations Security Council approved sending 26,000 UN peacekeepers into the region to join 7,000 troops from the African Union. The resolution was heralded as a major breakthrough in confronting the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/War_in_Darfur.htm" title="Darfur conflict">Darfur conflict</a> (although the United States labeled the conflict a "<!--del_lnk--> genocide," the United Nations has declined to do so). The first phase of the peacekeeping mission began in October 2007.</p>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Myanmar">Myanmar</span></h5>
       <p>Ban Ki-moon flew to Myanmar on 25 May 2008 to guide a conference with international agencies aimed at boosting donations for the nation, which was struck by <a href="../../wp/c/Cyclone_Nargis.htm" title="Cyclone Nargis">Cyclone Nargis</a> on 2 May 2008. The conference was initiated after Ban had met with <!--del_lnk--> Than Shwe, the leading figure of Myanmar's government 23 May 2008. Ban toured the devastation&mdash;especially in the hard-hit <!--del_lnk--> Irrawaddy Delta&mdash;23 May 2008 and 24 May 2008. Myanmar officials agreed to allow the <!--del_lnk--> Yangon International Airport to be used as a logistical hub for aid distribution.</p>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="LGBT_rights">LGBT rights</span></h5>
       <p>During a speech at the U.N. headquarters commemorating Human Rights Day, Ban condemned countries with anti-gay laws, mentioning 76 countries that criminalize homosexuality. He said:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>"It is an outrage that in our modern world, so many countries continue to criminalize people simply for loving another human being of the same sex."</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>Ban has told senior managers that homophobia will not be tolerated. He pointed to countries such as Ukraine which has proposed criminalizing public discussion about homosexuality as threatening basic human rights. He further stated that government have a duty to defend vulnerable minorities. In April 2013, he described LGBT rights as one of the great neglected human rights of our time. He also said that religion culture or tradition can never justify denial of basic rights.</p>

       <p>On 6 June 2011, Ban Ki-moon formally announced his candidacy for a second consecutive term as Secretary-General of the United Nations. He announced his candidacy at a press conference, following a meeting with the Asian group of countries at the United Nations. Ban Ki-moon's first mandate as the Secretary-General was set to end on 31 December 2011. The five permanent Security Council members supported his candidacy. There was no declared rival for the post.</p>
       <p>On 17 June 2011, he received the recommendation of the Security Council by a unanimous vote, and, on 21 June, his nomination was confirmed by a unanimous acclamation vote at the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_General_Assembly.htm" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a>.</p>

       <p>Ban Ki-moon met Yoo Soon-taek in 1962 when they were both high school students. Ban was 18 years old, and Yoo Soon-taek was his secondary school's student council president. Ban Ki-moon married Yoo Soon-taek in 1971. They have three adult children: two daughters and a son. His elder daughter, Seon-yong, was born in 1972 and now works for the <!--del_lnk--> Korea Foundation in Seoul. She is married to an Indian. His son, Woo-hyun was born in 1974 in India. He received an MBA from <!--del_lnk--> Anderson School of Management at <!--del_lnk--> University of California, Los Angeles, and works for an investment firm in New York. His younger daughter, Hyun-hee (born 1976), is a field officer for <!--del_lnk--> UNICEF in <a href="../../wp/n/Nairobi.htm" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>. After his election as Secretary-General, Ban became an icon in his hometown, where his extended family still resides. Over 50,000 gathered in a soccer stadium in Chungju for celebration of the result. In the months following his election, thousands of practitioners of geomancy went to his village to determine how it produced such an important person. Ban himself is not a member of any church or religious group and has declined to expound his beliefs: "Now, as Secretary-General, it will not be appropriate at this time to talk about my own belief in any particular religion or god. So maybe we will have some other time to talk about personal matters." His mother is a <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a>.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality">Personality</span></h3>
       <p>During his tenure at the South Korean Foreign Ministry, Ban's nickname was <i>jusa</i>, meaning "the Bureaucrat" or "the administrative clerk". The name was used as both positive and negative: complimenting Ban's attention to detail and administrative skill while deriding what was seen as a lack of charisma and subservience to his superiors. The South Korean press corps calls him "the slippery eel", for his ability to dodge questions. His peers praise his understated "<a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucian</a> approach." and he is regarded by many as a "stand-up guy" and is known for his "easy smile".</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Controversy">Controversy</span></h2>
       <p>According to <i><!--del_lnk--> The Washington Post</i>, "some U.N. employees and delegates" expressed resentment at Ban's perceived <!--del_lnk--> favoritism in the appointment of South Korean nationals in key posts. Previous U.N. chiefs such as <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Waldheim (Austria), <!--del_lnk--> Javier P&eacute;rez de Cu&eacute;llar (Peru) and <!--del_lnk--> Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their country's Foreign Ministry. But according to "some officials" in the <i>Post</i> story, Ban has gone further, boosting South Korea's presence in U.N. ranks by more than 20 percent during his first year in office. In response, Ban and his aides have claimed that allegations of favoritism are wrong, and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of <!--del_lnk--> racism. He said that the South Korean nationals he had appointed &mdash; including <!--del_lnk--> Choi Young-jin, who has served as a high-ranking official in the United Nations' peacekeeping department &mdash; are highly qualified for their positions. Others such as Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea say the complaints are driven by envy, "I think being from South Korea, and people have growing respect for South Korea, that's a great enhancement for the secretary general. If he brings along talented people who (whom) he knows very well, I think that's also a plus." U.N. records show that South Korea, the organization's eleventh-largest financial contributor, had 54 South Korean nationals assigned to its mission six months before Ban took over the top U.N. post.</p>
       <p>Former U.N. Under Secretary General for Oversight Services <!--del_lnk--> Inga-Britt Ahlenius denounced Ban Ki-moon after resigning her post in 2010, calling him reprehensible. Ahlenius's critique was based on the grounds that the Secretary-General consistently made efforts to undermine the Office of Internal Oversight Services mandate and challenge its operational independence. In particular, the two disputed Ahlenius's plans to hire a former prosecutor, Robert Appleton, who had carried out aggressive investigations into corruption in U.N. peacekeeping missions from 2006 to 2009. Ban's staff explained that Appleton's appointment was rejected because female candidates had not been properly considered, and said that the final selection should have been made by Ban, not Ahlenius. However, Ahlenius countered in her End of Assignment memo that "for the Secretary-General to control appointments in OIOS is an infringement of the operational independence of OIOS," and further stated, "There is no transparency, there is lack of accountability. Rather than supporting the internal oversight which is the sign of strong leadership and good governance, you have strived to undermine its position and to control it. I do not see any signs of reform in the Organization."</p>
       <p>Former U.N. corruption fighter, <!--del_lnk--> James Wasserstrom has also been critical of Ban Ki-moon for attempting to limit the jurisdiction of the <!--del_lnk--> U.N. dispute tribunal following his dismissal from his post in Kosovo and lengthy appeal. Ban had refused to hand over confidential documents relating to the case to the U.N. personnel tribunal, despite repeated orders by the court to do so. In relation to another case, Ban was admonished by Judge, Michael Adams for "wilful disobedience" for again failing to hand over key documents in an internal promotions dispute.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Question_of_bias">Question of bias</span></h3>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> ROKS <i>Cheonan</i> sinking events, he took the step of demanding action against North Korea for the alleged sinking of a vessel from his country. This was reported by U.N. Dispatch as being unusual, because it is rare for any Secretary-General&mdash;and particularly Ban Ki-moon&mdash;to comment on the Security Council taking action on an issue as his office had tended to be extremely deferential to the Security Council.</p>
