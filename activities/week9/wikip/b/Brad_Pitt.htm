       <p><b>William Bradley</b> "<b>Brad</b>" <b>Pitt</b> (born December 18, 1963) is an American actor and <!--del_lnk--> film producer. Pitt has received two <a href="../../wp/a/Academy_Award.htm" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nominations and four <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe Award nominations, winning one. He has been described as one of the world's most attractive men, a label for which he has received substantial media attention.</p>
       <p>Pitt began his acting career with television guest appearances, including a role on the <!--del_lnk--> CBS prime-time soap opera <!--del_lnk--> <i>Dallas</i> in 1987. He later gained recognition as the cowboy hitchhiker who seduces <!--del_lnk--> Geena Davis's character in the 1991 road movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Thelma &amp; Louise</i>. Pitt's first leading roles in big-budget productions came with <i><!--del_lnk--> A River Runs Through It</i> (1992) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Interview with the Vampire</i> (1994). He was cast opposite <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Hopkins in the 1994 drama <i><!--del_lnk--> Legends of the Fall</i>, which earned him his first Golden Globe nomination. In 1995 he gave critically acclaimed performances in the crime thriller <i><!--del_lnk--> Seven</i> and the science fiction film <i><!--del_lnk--> 12 Monkeys</i>, the latter securing him a <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination. Four years later, in 1999, Pitt starred in the cult hit <i><!--del_lnk--> Fight Club</i>. He then starred in the major international hit as Rusty Ryan in <i><!--del_lnk--> Ocean's Eleven</i> (2001) and its sequels, <i><!--del_lnk--> Ocean's Twelve</i> (2004) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Ocean's Thirteen</i> (2007). His greatest commercial successes have been <i><!--del_lnk--> Troy</i> (2004) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</i> (2005). Pitt received his second Academy Award nomination for his title role performance in the 2008 film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</i>.</p>
       <p>Following a high-profile relationship with actress <a href="../../wp/g/Gwyneth_Paltrow.htm" title="Gwyneth Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, Pitt was married to actress <!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Aniston for five years. Pitt currently lives with actress <a href="../../wp/a/Angelina_Jolie.htm" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> in a <!--del_lnk--> relationship that has generated wide publicity. He and Jolie have six children&mdash;Maddox, Zahara, Pax, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne. Since beginning his relationship with Jolie, he has become increasingly involved in social issues both in the United States and internationally. Pitt owns a production company named <!--del_lnk--> Plan B Entertainment, whose productions include the 2007 Academy Award winning <!--del_lnk--> Best Picture, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Departed</i>.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
       <p>The son of Jane Etta (n&eacute;e Hillhouse), a high school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company owner, Pitt was born in <!--del_lnk--> Shawnee, Oklahoma. Along with his siblings Doug (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born 1969), he grew up in <!--del_lnk--> Springfield, Missouri, where the family moved soon after his birth. He was raised as a conservative <!--del_lnk--> Southern Baptist.</p>
       <p>Pitt attended <!--del_lnk--> Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, tennis and swimming teams. He participated in the school's <!--del_lnk--> Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals. Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the <!--del_lnk--> University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism, with a focus on advertising. As a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Sigma Chi fraternity, he acted in several fraternity shows. As graduation approached, Pitt saw his friends getting jobs but did not feel ready to settle down himself. He loved films&mdash;"a portal into different worlds for me"&mdash;and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided he would go to where they were made. Two weeks before earning his degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_work">Early work</span></h3>
       <p>While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach <!--del_lnk--> Roy London. He took on various occasional jobs, spending some time as a chauffeur and dressing up as an <!--del_lnk--> El Pollo Loco chicken to pay for acting lessons.</p>
       <p>Pitt's onscreen career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films <i><!--del_lnk--> No Way Out</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> No Man's Land</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Less Than Zero</i>. His television debut came in November of the same year with a guest appearance on the <!--del_lnk--> ABC sitcom <i><!--del_lnk--> Growing Pains</i>. He appeared in four episodes of the <!--del_lnk--> CBS primetime <!--del_lnk--> soap opera <i><!--del_lnk--> Dallas</i> between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by <!--del_lnk--> Shalane McCall). Pitt described his character as "an idiot boyfriend who gets caught in the hay." Speaking of his scenes with McCall, Pitt later said "It was kind of wild, because I'd never even met her before." Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the <!--del_lnk--> Fox police drama <i><!--del_lnk--> 21 Jump Street</i>.</p>
       <p>In the same year, the Yugoslavian&ndash;U.S. co-production <i><!--del_lnk--> The Dark Side of the Sun</i> (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, as a young American taken by his family to the <!--del_lnk--> Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. However, the film was shelved on the outbreak of the <!--del_lnk--> Croatian War of Independence, and was released only in 1997. Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> Happy Together</i>; the second a featured role in the horror film <i><!--del_lnk--> Cutting Class</i>, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters. He made guest appearances on television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Head of the Class</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Freddy's Nightmares</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Thirtysomething</i>, and (for a second time) <i>Growing Pains</i>.</p>
       <p>Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by <!--del_lnk--> Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 <!--del_lnk--> NBC <!--del_lnk--> television movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Too Young to Die?</i>, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder. Ken Tucker, television reviewer for <i><!--del_lnk--> Entertainment Weekly</i> wrote: "Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary." The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama <i>Glory Days</i>, and took a supporting role in the <!--del_lnk--> HBO television movie <i><!--del_lnk--> The Image</i>. His next appearance came in the 1991 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Across the Tracks</i>; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by <!--del_lnk--> Ricky Schroder.</p>
       <p>After years of supporting roles in movies and frequent television guest appearances, broader public recognition came for Pitt with his supporting role in the 1991 road film <i><!--del_lnk--> Thelma &amp; Louise</i>. He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (<!--del_lnk--> Geena Davis). 
       <p>After <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i>, Pitt starred in the 1991 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Johnny Suede</i>, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star, and the 1992 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Cool World</i>, although neither furthered his career in light of their poor reviews and box office performance. Pitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film <i><!--del_lnk--> A River Runs Through It</i>, directed by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Redford. His portrayal of the character has been described as a career-making performance, proving that Pitt could be more than a "cowboy-hatted hunk", although he admitted that he felt under pressure when making the film. Pitt added that he considered it one of his "weakest performances&nbsp;... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for." Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew, going on to compare working with Redford to playing tennis, saying "when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better."</p>
       <p>In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis, co-star from <i>Too Young to Die?</i>, for the road film <i><!--del_lnk--> Kalifornia</i>. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the boyfriend of Lewis's character in a performance <!--del_lnk--> Peter Travers of <i><!--del_lnk--> Rolling Stone</i> described as "outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace". Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit <i><!--del_lnk--> True Romance</i> as a stoner named Floyd, providing much needed comic relief to the action film. He capped the year by winning a <!--del_lnk--> ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_success">Critical success</span></h3>
       <p>1994 marked a significant turning point in Pitt's career. Starring as vampire <!--del_lnk--> Louis de Pointe du Lac in the feature film <i><!--del_lnk--> Interview with the Vampire</i>, based on <!--del_lnk--> Anne Rice's 1976 <!--del_lnk--> novel of the same name, he was part of an ensemble cast that included <!--del_lnk--> Tom Cruise, <!--del_lnk--> Kirsten Dunst, <!--del_lnk--> Christian Slater, and <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Banderas. Despite winning two <!--del_lnk--> MTV Movie Awards at the <!--del_lnk--> 1995 ceremony, his performance was poorly received. According to the <i><!--del_lnk--> Dallas Observer</i>, "Brad Pitt&nbsp;... is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side&nbsp;... he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis."</p>

       <p>Following the release of <i>Interview with the Vampire</i>, Pitt starred in <i><!--del_lnk--> Legends of the Fall</i> (1994), a film set during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Pitt portrayed Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (<!--del_lnk--> Anthony Hopkins), and received his first <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe Award nomination, in the <!--del_lnk--> Best Actor category. <!--del_lnk--> Aidan Quinn and <!--del_lnk--> Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed, many film critics complimented Pitt's performance. <!--del_lnk--> Janet Maslin of <i><!--del_lnk--> The New York Times</i> said, "Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way" while the <i><!--del_lnk--> Deseret News</i> predicted that <i>Legends of the Fall</i> would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.</p>
       <p>In 1995, Pitt starred alongside <!--del_lnk--> Morgan Freeman and <a href="../../wp/g/Gwyneth_Paltrow.htm" title="Gwyneth Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> in the crime thriller <i><!--del_lnk--> Seven</i>, playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer (played by <a href="../../wp/k/Kevin_Spacey.htm" title="Kevin Spacey">Kevin Spacey</a>). Pitt called the film a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons, expressing a desire to move on from "this 'pretty boy' thing [...] and play someone with flaws". His performance was critically well-received, with <i><!--del_lnk--> Variety</i> saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on Pitt's ability to turn in a "determined, energetic, creditable job" as the detective. <i>Seven</i> earned $327&nbsp;million at the international box office.</p>
       <p>Following the success of <i>Seven</i>, Pitt took a supporting role as Jeffrey Goines in <!--del_lnk--> Terry Gilliam's 1995 <!--del_lnk--> science-fiction film <i><!--del_lnk--> 12 Monkeys</i>. The movie received predominantly positive reviews, with Pitt praised in particular. Janet Maslin of the <i>New York Times</i> called <i>Twelve Monkeys</i> "fierce and disturbing" and remarked on Pitt's "startlingly frenzied performance", concluding that he "electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film." He won a Golden Globe Award for <!--del_lnk--> Best Supporting Actor for the film and received his first <a href="../../wp/a/Academy_Award.htm" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for <!--del_lnk--> Best Supporting Actor.</p>
       <p>The following year he had a role in the legal drama <i><!--del_lnk--> Sleepers</i> (1996), based on the <!--del_lnk--> Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel of the same name. The film received mixed reviews. In the 1997 movie <i><!--del_lnk--> The Devil's Own</i> Pitt starred, opposite <!--del_lnk--> Harrison Ford, as the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Republican Army terrorist Rory Devany, a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent. Critical opinion was divided on his approximation of the accent; "Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing&nbsp;&ndash; it's hard to understand what he's saying", wrote the <i><!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Chronicle</i> while a contributor from <i><!--del_lnk--> The Charleston Gazette</i> opined that it had favored Pitt's accent over the movie. <i>The Devil's Own</i> grossed $140&nbsp;million worldwide, but was a critical failure. Later that year he led as Austrian mountaineer <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Harrer in the <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Jacques Annaud film <i><!--del_lnk--> Seven Years in Tibet</i>. Pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including by rock climbing in California and the European <!--del_lnk--> Alps with his co-star <!--del_lnk--> David Thewlis. The film received mostly negative reviews, and was generally considered a disappointment.</p>
       <p>Pitt then had the lead role in 1998's <i><!--del_lnk--> Meet Joe Black</i>. He portrayed a <!--del_lnk--> personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human. The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to <!--del_lnk--> Mick LaSalle of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, Pitt was unable to "to make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="From_1999_to_2003">From 1999 to 2003</span></h3>
       <p>In 1999, Pitt portrayed <!--del_lnk--> Tyler Durden, an uncompromising and charismatic individual, in <i><!--del_lnk--> Fight Club</i>, a film adaptation of <!--del_lnk--> Chuck Palahniuk's <!--del_lnk--> novel of the same name, directed by <!--del_lnk--> David Fincher. Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in <!--del_lnk--> boxing, <a href="../../wp/t/Taekwondo.htm" title="Taekwondo">taekwondo</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> grappling. To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended. While promoting <i>Fight Club</i>, Pitt said that the purpose of the film was not necessarily to take one's aggressions out on someone else but rather to "have an experience, take a punch more" and see how you come out on the other end. <i>Fight Club</i> premiered at the 1999 <!--del_lnk--> Venice International Film Festival and, despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Pitt's performance was broadly praised. <!--del_lnk--> Paul Clinton of <!--del_lnk--> CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film while <i>Variety</i> remarked upon Pitt's ability to be "cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than [...] his breakthrough role in <i>Thelma and Louise</i>". In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, <i>Fight Club</i> became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Following <i>Fight Club</i>, Pitt was cast as an Irish Gypsy <!--del_lnk--> boxer with a barely intelligible accent in <!--del_lnk--> Guy Ritchie's 2000 gangster film <i><!--del_lnk--> Snatch</i>. Several reviewers were critical of <i>Snatch</i>, however most praised Pitt. Mick LaSalle of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> said Pitt was "ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can't understand him", going on to say that, before <i>Snatch</i>, Pitt had been "shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;" while <!--del_lnk--> Amy Taubin of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Village Voice</i> claimed that "Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role".</p>
       <p>The following year Pitt starred opposite <!--del_lnk--> Julia Roberts in the <!--del_lnk--> romantic comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> The Mexican</i>, a film that garnered a broad range of reviews but enjoyed box office success. Pitt's next role, in 2001's $143&nbsp;million-grossing <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> thriller <i><!--del_lnk--> Spy Game</i>, was as Tom Bishop, an operative of the <!--del_lnk--> CIA's <!--del_lnk--> Special Activities Division, mentored by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Redford's character. <!--del_lnk--> Salon.com enjoyed the film, though noting that neither Pitt nor Redford provided "much of an emotional connection for the audience". On November 22, 2001, Pitt made a guest appearance in the <!--del_lnk--> eighth season of the television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Friends</i>, playing a man with a grudge against <!--del_lnk--> Rachel Green, played by <!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Aniston, to whom Pitt was married at the time. For this performance he was nominated for an <!--del_lnk--> Emmy Award in the category for <!--del_lnk--> Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. In December 2001, Pitt had the role of <!--del_lnk--> Rusty Ryan in the heist film <i><!--del_lnk--> Ocean's Eleven</i>, a remake of the 1960 <!--del_lnk--> Rat Pack original. He joined an ensemble cast including <a href="../../wp/g/George_Clooney.htm" title="George Clooney">George Clooney</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Matt Damon, <!--del_lnk--> Andy Garc&iacute;a, and Julia Roberts. Well-received by critics, <i>Ocean's Eleven</i> was successful at the box office, earning $450&nbsp;million worldwide.</p>
       <p>Pitt appeared in two episodes of <!--del_lnk--> MTV's reality series <i><!--del_lnk--> Jackass</i> in February 2002, first running through the streets of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> with several cast members in gorilla suits, and participating in his own staged abduction in another episode. In the same year, Pitt had a cameo role in George Clooney's directorial debut <i><!--del_lnk--> Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</i>. He took on his first voice-acting roles in 2003, lending his voice to the titular character of the <!--del_lnk--> DreamWorks animated film <i><!--del_lnk--> Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas</i> and playing <!--del_lnk--> Boomhauer's brother, <!--del_lnk--> Patch, in an episode of the animated television series <i><!--del_lnk--> King of the Hill</i>.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="After_2003">After 2003</span></h3>
       <p>Pitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles.htm" title="Achilles">Achilles</a> in <i><!--del_lnk--> Troy</i>, and making a second appearance as <!--del_lnk--> Rusty Ryan, in the sequel <i><!--del_lnk--> Ocean's Twelve</i>. He spent six months sword training before the filming of <i>Troy</i>, based on the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i>. An on-set injury to his <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles_tendon.htm" title="Achilles tendon">Achilles tendon</a> delayed production on the picture for several weeks. With a total worldwide gross of $497&nbsp;million, <i>Troy</i> remains Pitt's most commercially successful picture to date. The film earned $364&nbsp;million outside the U.S. and $133&nbsp;million domestically. <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Hunter of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Washington Times</i> stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role. <i>Ocean's Twelve</i> earned $362&nbsp;million worldwide, and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described (by CNN's Paul Clinton) as "the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford".</p>
       <p>In 2005, Pitt starred in the <!--del_lnk--> Doug Liman-directed action comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</i>, in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and <a href="../../wp/a/Angelina_Jolie.htm" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, who played his character's wife Jane Smith. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Tribune</i> noted that "while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry." <i>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</i> earned $478&nbsp;million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>For his next feature film, Pitt starred opposite <!--del_lnk--> Cate Blanchett in <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's multi-narrative drama <i><!--del_lnk--> Babel</i> (2006). Pitt's performance was critically well-received, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> believed that he was credible and gave the film visibility. Pitt later said he regarded taking the part as one of the best decisions of his career. The film was screened at a special presentation at the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was later featured at the 2006 <!--del_lnk--> Toronto International Film Festival. <i>Babel</i> received seven Academy and Golden Globe award nominations, wining the <!--del_lnk--> Best Drama Golden Globe, and earned Pitt a nomination for the <!--del_lnk--> Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe.</p>
       <p>Reprising his role as Rusty Ryan in a third picture, Pitt starred in 2007's <i><!--del_lnk--> Ocean's Thirteen</i>. While less lucrative than the first two films, this sequel earned $311&nbsp;million at the international box office. Pitt's next film role was as American outlaw <!--del_lnk--> Jesse James in the 2007 <!--del_lnk--> Western drama <i><!--del_lnk--> The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</i>, adapted from <!--del_lnk--> Ron Hansen's <!--del_lnk--> 1983 novel of the same name. Directed by <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Dominik and produced by Pitt's company Plan B, the film premiered at the <!--del_lnk--> 2007 Venice Film Festival, with Pitt playing a "scary and charismatic" role, according to <!--del_lnk--> Lewis Beale of <i><!--del_lnk--> Film Journal International</i>, and earning Pitt the <!--del_lnk--> Volpi Cup award for Best Actor at the <!--del_lnk--> 64th Venice International Film Festival. Although Pitt attended the festival to promote the film, he left early after being attacked by a fan who pushed through his bodyguards. He eventually collected the award one year later at the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 festival.</p>
       <p>Pitt's next appearance was in the 2008 black comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> Burn After Reading</i>, his first collaboration with the <!--del_lnk--> Coen brothers. The film received a positive reception from critics, with <i><!--del_lnk--> The Guardian</i> calling it "a tightly wound, slickly plotted spy comedy", noting that Pitt's performance was one of the funniest. He was later cast as Benjamin Button, the lead in <!--del_lnk--> David Fincher's 2008 film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</i>, a loosely adapted version of a 1921 <!--del_lnk--> short story by <!--del_lnk--> F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story follows a man who is born an <!--del_lnk--> octogenarian and ages in reverse, with Pitt's "sensitive" performance making <i>Benjamin Button</i> a "timeless masterpiece," according to <!--del_lnk--> Michael Sragow of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Baltimore Sun</i>. The performance earned Pitt his first <!--del_lnk--> Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, as well as a fourth Golden Globe and second Academy Award nomination, all in the category for Best Actor. The film itself received thirteen Academy Award nominations in total, and grossed $329&nbsp;million at the box office worldwide.</p>
       <p>Since 2008, Pitt's work has included a leading role in <!--del_lnk--> Quentin Tarantino's <i><!--del_lnk--> Inglourious Basterds</i>, released in August 2009 at a special presentation at the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Pitt played Lieutenant Aldo Raine, an American resistance fighter battling <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazi">Nazis</a> in German-occupied France. The film was a box office hit, taking $311&nbsp;million worldwide, and garnering generally favorable reviews. The film received multiple <!--del_lnk--> awards and nominations, including eight Academy Award nominations and seven <!--del_lnk--> MTV Movie Award nominations, including <!--del_lnk--> Best Male Performance for Pitt. He voiced the superhero character Metro Man in the 2010 animated feature <i><!--del_lnk--> Megamind</i>. Pitt is due to appear in <!--del_lnk--> Terrence Malick's drama <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tree of Life</i>, co-starring <!--del_lnk--> Sean Penn, and has signed on to appear as a British explorer searching for a mysterious Amazonian civilization in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Lost City of Z</i>, based on <!--del_lnk--> David Grann's <!--del_lnk--> eponymous book.</p>

       <p>Along with <!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Aniston and <!--del_lnk--> Brad Grey, <!--del_lnk--> CEO of <!--del_lnk--> Paramount Pictures, Pitt founded the film production company <!--del_lnk--> Plan B Entertainment in 2002, although Aniston and Grey withdrew in 2005. The company has produced several films, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> starring <a href="../../wp/j/Johnny_Depp.htm" title="Johnny Depp">Johnny Depp</a> in 2005, as well as 2007's <i><!--del_lnk--> The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> A Mighty Heart</i>, starring <a href="../../wp/a/Angelina_Jolie.htm" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>. Plan B was also involved in producing <i><!--del_lnk--> The Departed</i>, the winner of the 2007 <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award for Best Picture. Pitt was credited onscreen as a producer; however, only <!--del_lnk--> Graham King was ruled eligible for the Oscar win. Pitt has been reluctant to discuss the production company in interviews.</p>
       <p>Pitt has appeared in several <!--del_lnk--> television commercials: one for the U.S. market, a <!--del_lnk--> Heineken commercial aired during the <!--del_lnk--> 2005 Super Bowl; it was directed by <!--del_lnk--> David Fincher, who had directed Pitt in <i><!--del_lnk--> Seven</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Fight Club</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</i>. Other commercial appearances came in television spots designed for Asian markets, advertising such products as the <!--del_lnk--> Acura Integra, in which he was featured opposite Russian model <!--del_lnk--> Tatiana Sorokko, as well as <!--del_lnk--> SoftBank and <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Jeans.</p>

       <p>Pitt supports the <!--del_lnk--> ONE Campaign, an organization aimed at combating AIDS and poverty in the developing world. He narrated the 2005 <!--del_lnk--> PBS public television series <i>Rx for Survival: A Global Health Challenge</i>, which discusses current global health issues and traveled to <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> in November 2005 with Angelina Jolie to see the impact of the <a href="../../wp/2/2005_Kashmir_earthquake.htm" title="2005 Kashmir earthquake">2005 Kashmir earthquake</a>. The following year Pitt and Jolie flew to <a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>, where they visited a school supported by Y&eacute;le Ha&iuml;ti, a charity founded by Haitian-born hip hop musician <!--del_lnk--> Wyclef Jean.

       <p>Pitt has a sustained interest in architecture and has narrated <i><!--del_lnk--> Design e2</i>, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. He founded the <!--del_lnk--> Make It Right Foundation in 2006, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150&nbsp;sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's <!--del_lnk--> Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization <!--del_lnk--> Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services.

Pitt met with U.S. President <a href="../../wp/b/Barack_Obama.htm" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> and Speaker of the House of Representatives <!--del_lnk--> Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote his concept of <i>green housing</i> as a national model and to discuss federal funding possibilities.</p>
       <p>In September 2006, Pitt and Jolie established a charitable organization, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to aid humanitarian causes around the world. The foundation made initial donations of $1&nbsp;million each to <!--del_lnk--> Global Action for Children and <!--del_lnk--> Doctors Without Borders, followed by an October 2006 donation of $100,000 to the Daniel Pearl Foundation, an organization created in memory of the late American journalist <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Pearl. According to federal filings, Pitt and Jolie invested $8.5&nbsp;million into the foundation in 2006; it gave away $2.4&nbsp;million in 2006 and $3.4&nbsp;million in 2007.

       <p>Pitt met <i><!--del_lnk--> Friends</i> actress <!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Aniston in 1998 and married her in a private wedding ceremony in <!--del_lnk--> Malibu on July 29, 2000. For years their marriage was considered a rare Hollywood success; however, in January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced that they had decided formally to separate after seven years together. Two months later Aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.</p>
       <p>During Pitt's divorce from Aniston, his involvement with <i><!--del_lnk--> Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</i> co-star <a href="../../wp/a/Angelina_Jolie.htm" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> attracted vigorous media attention. While Pitt denied claims of adultery, he admitted that he "fell in love" with Jolie on the set and said that production on <i>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</i> would continue after his separation from Aniston.</p>
       <p>In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of <!--del_lnk--> paparazzi photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie and her son Maddox at a beach in <a href="../../wp/k/Kenya.htm" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>; the pictures were construed in the press as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie. During the summer of 2005 the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple "<!--del_lnk--> Brangelina". Pitt and Aniston's divorce was finalized by the <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Superior Court on October 2, 2005, legally ending their marriage. On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to <i><!--del_lnk--> People</i> that she was pregnant with Pitt's child, thereby publicly confirming their relationship for the first time. In an October 2006 interview with <i><!--del_lnk--> Esquire</i>, Pitt said that he and Jolie would marry when everyone in America is legally able to marry. In February 2010, Pitt and Jolie sued the British tabloid <i><!--del_lnk--> News of the World</i> over reports that the two were splitting up.</p>
       <p>Despite media reports that Pitt and Aniston have an acrimonious relationship, in a February 2009 interview, Pitt said that he and Aniston "check in with each other", adding that they were both big parts of each others' lives.</p>
       <p>In an October 2007 interview, Pitt revealed that he is no longer a <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> and does not believe in an <!--del_lnk--> afterlife. "There's peace in understanding that I have only one life, here and now, and I'm responsible." In a July 2009 interview he said that he did not believe in God, and that he was "probably 20 percent <a href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheism">atheist</a> and 80 percent <a href="../../wp/a/Agnosticism.htm" title="Agnosticism">agnostic</a>."</p>

       <p>In July 2005, Pitt accompanied Jolie to Ethiopia, where she adopted her second child, a six-month-old girl named Zahara, a decision which Jolie later stated she and Pitt had made together. It was confirmed, in December 2005, that Pitt was seeking to legally adopt Jolie's two children, Maddox and Zahara; on January 19, 2006, a California judge granted their request to change the children's surnames to "Jolie-Pitt".</p>
       <p>Jolie gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, in <!--del_lnk--> Swakopmund, Namibia, on May 27, 2006. Pitt confirmed that their newly born daughter would have a Namibian passport. The couple sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor <!--del_lnk--> Getty Images and the North American rights were purchased by <i>People</i> for over $4.1&nbsp;million, while British magazine <i><!--del_lnk--> Hello!</i> obtained the international rights for approximately $3.5&nbsp;million. The proceeds from the sale, up to $10&nbsp;million worldwide, were donated to an undisclosed charity by Pitt and Jolie. <!--del_lnk--> Madame Tussauds in New York unveiled a <!--del_lnk--> wax figure of two-month-old Shiloh, making Shiloh the first infant to have a statue at Madame Tussauds.</p>
       <p>On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a three-year-old boy from <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt (originally Pax Thien Jolie). Since the orphanage did not allow unmarried couples to adopt, Jolie adopted Pax as a single parent, and Pitt later adopted him as his son in the United States.</p>
       <p>Following months of media speculation, Jolie confirmed in an interview at the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 Cannes Film Festival that she was expecting twins. She gave birth at the Lenval hospital in <!--del_lnk--> Nice, France, on July 12, 2008. The twins were named Knox L&eacute;on and Vivienne Marcheline. The rights for the first images of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to <i>People</i> and <i>Hello!</i> for $14&nbsp;million&mdash;the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken. The couple donated the proceeds to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.</p>
