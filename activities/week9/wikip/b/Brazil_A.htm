<p>SOS Social Centre Sao Bernando do Campo is on the site of former SOS Children&#x2019;s Village. The Centre offers help and assistance to the people from the neighbourhood. For example, the social centre provides full day care for up to 277 pre-school children from the local community.</p>
<p><strong>Work and Achievements:</strong></p>
<p>At present, the Social Centre provides support to 130 families and 300 children aged between 2 years and 3 months and 14 years and 11 months, carrying out an average of 25 to 30 support sessions a month. The families and other members of the community come to us in search of information on rights, child education and family conflicts, and also to participate in the leisure activities and moments of family integration. The Centre is known by the people in the neighbourhood as a place where the family relationships and the socio-assistance network are strengthened, and where they can look for information on their fundamental rights. Among the activities carried out during the year are:</p>
<p>In addition to the daily activities, the children and adolescents participated in a carnival troupe called EURECA &#x2013; I Acknowledge the Statute of Children and Adolescents, and in the Preparation and Execution of the Playful Conference, which addressed issues such as environment and sexuality. We also had a slumber party in the family houses&#x2019; space, which is currently empty. The children and adolescents had a lot of fun with a fire, short stories, movies and dance.</p>
<h2>Bahia</h2>
<p><strong>Description of SOS Social Centre/FSP:</strong></p>
<p>In May 2001, an SOS Social Centre was opened. It is a day-care centre for up to 210 pre-school children</p>
<p><strong>Work and Achievements:</strong></p>
<p>At present, we provide care to 203 families and 220 children aged between 4 and 12. Last year, we were working with children from one year old onwards, that is why we had a higher number of people supported.<br />Due to the changes in the process, the activities are now carried out in a unified way, comprising all sexes and ages. &nbsp;<br />The Social Centre provides socio-educational activities with general subjects to attract the attention of the external community that is not totally engaged yet. We also need to make some progress when it comes to partnerships, increase opportunities and shorten the distance between communities and social networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Juiz de Fora</h2>
<p><strong>Description of SOS Social Centre/FSP:</strong></p>
<p>SOS Children's Village Juiz de Fora runs an SOS Social Centre, which offers full day-care for up to 620 pre-school children.</p>
<p><strong>Work and Achievements:</strong></p>
<p>In 2009, the Family and Community&nbsp; Strengthening Programme reached 180 families, by providing direct support to 206 children aged between 2 and 5; 105 boys and 101 girls. The number of children supported decreased in relationship to last year, due to two reasons. The end of the activities in one of the centres (Paulo Filipino Association); and adjustments in the number of children per classroom in Hermann Gmeiner Child School, in compliance with requirements from the Municipal Department of Education. It is important to mention that the Programme is the only one in the community to provide care to children aged between 2 and 3 years, which makes it essential.</p>
<p>We work on all biological, social and psychological aspects of the children, by developing actions to promote their autonomy and participation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the cases in which our support is not enough for the needs identified, we get in contact with the local social network so that the child can get specific care. As for women and families, we focus our attention on issues related to rights, health, child education and community participation. We deal with these matters by emphasizing its informative and preventive aspects through individual support sessions, talking circles and house calls. In regards to the community, we researched on the history of the neighbourhood and its weak and potential points with the aim to strengthen the local network. For that, we counted on the participation of families, business people, community leaders, health representatives, the media, and other members of the local network.</p>
