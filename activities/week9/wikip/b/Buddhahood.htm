       <p>In <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <b>buddhahood</b> (<a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>: <i>buddhatva</i>.<!--del_lnk--> Pali: <i>buddhatta</i>. Or (both) <i>buddhabh&#x101;va</i>) is the state of perfect <!--del_lnk--> enlightenment (Sanskrit: <i>samyaksambodhi</i>. Pali: <i>samm&#x101;sambodhi</i>) attained by a <b>buddha</b> (Pali/<a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> for "awakened one").</p>
       <p>In Buddhism, the term 'buddha' usually refers to one who has become enlightened (i.e., awakened to the truth, or <i><!--del_lnk--> Dharma</i>). The level to which this manifestation requires abstraction from ordinary life (<!--del_lnk--> ascetic practices) varies from none at all to an absolute requirement, dependent on doctrine. In <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhist traditions, it is held that the person attains this state on their own, without a teacher to point out the <!--del_lnk--> Dharma, in a time when the teachings on the <!--del_lnk--> Four Noble Truths or the <!--del_lnk--> Eightfold Path do not exist in the world, and teaches it to others. In contrast, certain <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhist traditions (particularly those that consider the teachings of the <!--del_lnk--> Lotus Sutra to be paramount, which contains this concept) Buddhahood is considered to be a universal and innate property of absolute wisdom that is revealed in a person's current lifetime through Buddhist practice, without any specific relinquishment of pleasures or "earthly desires". Thus, there is an extremely broad spectrum of opinion on the universality and method of attainment of Buddhahood which is correlated to which of Shakyamuni Buddha's teachings that a school of Buddhism follows.</p>
       <p>More broadly, it is occasionally used to refer to all who attain <!--del_lnk--> nirvana.. In this broader sense it is equivalent to <!--del_lnk--> Arahant. According to Theravada Buddhism, all Arahants (or Buddhas in the broader sense) are the same in the most fundamental aspects of Liberation (<!--del_lnk--> Nirvana), but differ in their practice of perfections <!--del_lnk--> paramis. Mahayana Buddhism, however, considers there is a fundamental difference between Buddhas and ordinary arhants, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a buddhist proceeds <!--del_lnk--> bodhisattva stages. Buddhists do not consider <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Siddhartha Gautama">Siddhartha Gautama</a> to have been the only Buddha. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/P%25C4%2581li_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a> refers to many previous ones (see <!--del_lnk--> List of the 28 Buddhas), while the <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana tradition additionally has many Buddhas of celestial, rather than historical, origin (see <!--del_lnk--> Amitabha or <!--del_lnk--> Vairocana as examples, lists of many thousands buddha names see <!--del_lnk--> Taisho Tripitaka no 439-448). A common Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist belief is that the next Buddha will be one named <!--del_lnk--> Maitreya (Pali: Metteyya).</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Buddha">Kinds of Buddha</span></h2>
       <p>In the Pali commentaries, three kinds of buddha are mentioned:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Sammasambuddhas attain buddhahood, then decide to teach others the truth they have discovered. They lead others to awakening by teaching the <!--del_lnk--> Dhamma in a time where it has been forgotten. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Siddhartha Gautama">Siddhartha Gautama</a> is considered a sammasambuddha. (See also the <!--del_lnk--> List of the 28 Buddhas (all of whom are sammasambuddhas).)</li>
        <li>Paccekabuddhas, sometimes called 'silent Buddhas' are similar to sammasambuddhas in that they attain <!--del_lnk--> nirvana and acquire many of the same powers as a sammasambuddha, but are unable to teach what they have discovered. They are considered second to the sammasambuddhas in spiritual development. They do ordain others; their admonition is only in reference to good and proper conduct (abhisam&#x101;c&#x101;rikasikkh&#x101;). In some texts, the paccekabuddhas are described as those who understand the Dhamma through their own efforts, but obtain neither omniscience nor mastery over the 'fruits' (phalesu vas&#x12B;bh&#x101;vam).<!--del_lnk--> </li>
        <li>Savakabuddhas attain nirvana after hearing the teaching of a sammasambuddha (directly or indirectly). The disciple of a sammasambuddha is called a <!--del_lnk--> savaka ("hearer" or "follower") or, once enlightened, an <!--del_lnk--> arahant. These terms have slightly varied meanings but can all be used to describe the enlightened disciple. <i>Anubuddha</i> is a rarely used term, but is used by the Buddha in the <i>Khuddakapatha</i> to refer to those who become Buddhas after being given instruction. Enlightened disciples attain nirvana and parinirvana as the two types of Buddha do. <!--del_lnk--> Arahant is the term most generally used for them, though it is also applicable to Buddhas.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/P%25C4%2581li_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a> itself, the first two are mentioned by the above names, while numerous examples of the third type occur, without that name. There is no mention of types of buddhas, though the word buddha does sometimes appear to be used in a broad sense covering all the above.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics_of_a_Buddha">Characteristics of a Buddha</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nine_characteristics">Nine characteristics</span></h3>
       <p>Some Buddhists meditate on (or contemplate) the Buddha as having nine characteristics:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>a worthy one (Skt: <i>arhat</i>)</li>
        <li>perfectly self-enlightened (Skt: <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">samyak-sa&#x1E43;buddha</span></i>)</li>
        <li>perfected in knowledge and conduct (Skt: <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">vidy&#x101;-cara&#x1E47;a-sa&#x1E43;panna</span></i> )</li>
        <li>well gone (Skt: <i>sugata</i>)</li>
        <li>unsurpassed knower of the world (Skt: <i>anuttara-loka-vid</i>)</li>
        <li>unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed (Skt: <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">anuttara-puru&#x1E63;a-damya-s&#x101;rathi</span></i>)</li>
        <li>teacher of the gods and humans (Skt: <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">&#x15B;&#x101;st&#x1E5B; deva-manu&#x1E63;y&#x101;&#x1E47;a&#x1E43;</span></i>)</li>
        <li>the Enlightened One (Skt: <i>buddha</i>)</li>
        <li>the Blessed One or fortunate one (Skt: <i>bhagavat</i>)</li>
       </ol>
       <p>These characteristics are frequently mentioned in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/P%25C4%2581li_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a>, and are chanted daily in many Buddhist monasteries.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_names">Other names</span></h3>

       <p>All Buddhist traditions hold that a Buddha has completely purified his mind of desire, aversion and ignorance, and that he is no longer bound by <!--del_lnk--> Samsara. A Buddha is fully awakened and has realized the ultimate truth, the non-dualistic nature of life, and thus ended (for himself) the <!--del_lnk--> suffering which unawakened people experience in life.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nature_of_the_Buddha">Nature of the Buddha</span></h3>
       <p>The various Buddhist schools hold some varying interpretations on the nature of Buddha (see below).</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Buddha_as_a_supreme_human">Buddha as a supreme human</span></h4>
       <p>Different schools view Buddha differently, with <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhism emerges the view that the <!--del_lnk--> Buddha was human, endowed with the greatest psychic powers (<!--del_lnk--> Kevatta Sutta). The body and mind (the five <!--del_lnk--> khandhas) of a Buddha are impermanent and changing, just like the body and mind of ordinary people. However, a Buddha recognizes the unchanging nature of the <!--del_lnk--> Dharma, which is an eternal principle and an unconditioned and timeless phenomenon. This view is common in the Theravada school, and the other <!--del_lnk--> early Buddhist schools.</p>
       <p>Although the Theravada school does not emphasize the more supernatural and divine aspects of the Buddha that are available in the Pali Canon, elements of Buddha as the supreme person are found throughout this canon.</p>
       <p>In <b>MN 18 Madhupindika Sutta</b>, Buddha is described in powerful terms as the Lord of the Dhamma (Pali: Dhammasami, skt.: Dharma Swami) and the bestower of immortality (Pali: Amatassadata).</p>
       <p>Similarly, in the <b>Anuradha Sutta</b> (SN 44.2) Buddha is described as " the Tathagata &mdash; the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the superlative attainment". Buddha is asked about what happens to the Tathagatha after death of the physical body.</p>
       <p>Buddha replies, "And so, Anuradha &mdash; when you can't pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life &mdash; is it proper for you to declare, 'Friends, the Tathagata &mdash; the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the superlative attainment &mdash; being described, is described otherwise than with these four positions: The Tathagata exists after death, does not exist after death, both does &amp; does not exist after death, neither exists nor does not exist after death'?"</p>
       <p>In the Vakkali Sutta Buddha identifies himself with the Dhamma:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd><i>O Vakkali, whoever sees the Dhamma, sees me [the Buddha]</i></dd>
       </dl>
       <p>Another reference from the Agganna Sutta of the <!--del_lnk--> Digha Nikaya, says to his disciple Vasettha:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd><i>O Vasettha! The Word of Dhammakaya is indeed the name of the Tathagata</i></dd>
       </dl>
       <p>In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/P%25C4%2581li_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canons</a> Gautama Buddha is known as being a "teacher of the gods and humans", superior to both the gods and humans in the sense of having <!--del_lnk--> nirvana or the greatest bliss (whereas the <!--del_lnk--> devas or gods of the <!--del_lnk--> Vedic era were still subject to anger, fear, sorrow, etc.).</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In some sutras found in <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhism, the Buddha teaches that the Buddha is no longer essentially a human being but has become a being of a different order altogether and that, in his ultimate transcendental "body/mind" mode as <!--del_lnk--> Dharmakaya, he has eternal and infinite life, is present in all things (i.e., is "the boundless <!--del_lnk--> dharmadhatu", according to the <!--del_lnk--> Nirvana Sutra), and is possessed of great and immeasurable qualities. In the <!--del_lnk--> Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Buddha declares: "Nirvana is stated to be eternally abiding. The Tathagata [Buddha] is also thus, eternally abiding, without change." This is a particularly important metaphysical and soteriological doctrine in the <!--del_lnk--> Lotus Sutra and the <!--del_lnk--> Tathagatagarbha sutras. According to the Tathagatagarbha sutras, failure to recognize the Buddha's eternity and - even worse - outright denial of that eternity, is deemed a major obstacle to the attainment of complete awakening (<!--del_lnk--> bodhi).</p>
       <p>For the Tibetan Buddhist master, <!--del_lnk--> Dolpopa, and his <!--del_lnk--> Jonangpa School, the Buddha is to be understood as the wondrous and holy wish-fulfilling Essence of all things, beyond comprehension:</p>
       <p>"Buddha - an essence of immeasurable, incomprehensible, unfathomable, excellent exalted body, wisdom, qualities, and activities extremely wondrous and fantastic - is vast like space and the holy source, giving rise to all that is wished by sentient beings like a wish-granting jewel, a wish-granting tree &hellip;" (Dolpopa, <i>Mountain Doctrine</i>, tr. by Jeffrey Hopkins, Snow Lion Publications, 2006, p. 424).</p>

       <p>In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/P%25C4%2581li_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a> there is frequent mention of a list of <!--del_lnk--> 32 physical marks of Buddha.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hand-gestures">Hand-gestures</span></h3>
       <p>The poses and hand-gestures of these statues, known respectively as <!--del_lnk--> asanas and <!--del_lnk--> mudras, are significant to their overall meaning. The popularity of any particular mudra or asana tends to be region-specific, such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Vajra</i> (or <i>Chi Ken-in</i>) mudra, which is popular in <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Korea but rarely seen in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. Others are more common; for example, the <i>Varada</i> (Wish Granting) mudra is common among standing statues of the Buddha, particularly when coupled with the <i>Abhaya</i> (Fearlessness and Protection) mudra.</p>
