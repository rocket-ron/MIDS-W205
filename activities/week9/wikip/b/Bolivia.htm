Bolivia has struggled through periods of political instability and economic woes.</p>
       <p>Bolivia is a democratic republic that is divided into nine departments. Its geography is varied from the peaks of the Andes in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the Amazon Basin. It is a <!--del_lnk--> developing country, with a Medium <!--del_lnk--> Human Development Index score, and a poverty level of 53%. Its main economic activities include <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Forestry.htm" title="Forestry">forestry</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">fishing</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">mining</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> goods such as textiles, clothing, refined metals, and <!--del_lnk--> refined petroleum. Bolivia is very <!--del_lnk--> wealthy in minerals, especially <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a>. Bolivia has gained global attention for its '<!--del_lnk--> Law of the Rights of Mother Earth', one of the unique laws in the world that accord nature the same rights as humans.</p>
       <p>The Bolivian population, estimated at 10&nbsp;million, is <!--del_lnk--> multiethnic, including <!--del_lnk--> Amerindians, <a href="../../wp/m/Mestizo.htm" title="Mestizo">Mestizos</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Europeans, <!--del_lnk--> Asians and <!--del_lnk--> Africans. The main language spoken is <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, although the <!--del_lnk--> Guarani, <!--del_lnk--> Aymara and <!--del_lnk--> Quechua languages are also common and all three, as well as 34 other <!--del_lnk--> indigenous languages, are official. The large number of different cultures within Bolivia has contributed greatly to a wide diversity in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>Bolivia was named after <!--del_lnk--> Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, a leader in the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish American wars of independence. <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Jos&eacute; de Sucre had been given the option by Bol&iacute;var to either keep <!--del_lnk--> Upper Peru (present-day Bolivia) under the newly formed <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Republic of Peru">Republic of Peru</a>, to unite with the <!--del_lnk--> United Provinces of Rio de la Plata, or to formally declare its independence from the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of Peru that had dominated most of the region. Sucre opted to create a new nation and, with local support, named it in honour of Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var.</p>
       <p>The original name given to the newly formed country was <i>Republic of Bol&iacute;var</i>. Some days later congressman Manuel Mart&iacute;n Cruz proposed: "If from <!--del_lnk--> Romulus comes Rome, then from <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sim%25C3%25B3n_Bol%25C3%25ADvar.htm" title="Bol&iacute;var">Bol&iacute;var</a> comes Bolivia" (Spanish: <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>Si de R&oacute;mulo Roma, de Bol&iacute;var Bolivia</i></span>). The name stuck and was approved by the Republic on 3 October 1825.</p>
       <p>In 2009, a <!--del_lnk--> new constitution changed the country's name from the "Republic of Bolivia" to the "Plurinational State of Bolivia" in recognition of the multi-ethnic nature of the country and the enhanced position of Bolivia's indigenous peoples under the new constitution.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The region now known as Bolivia had been occupied for over 2,000 years when the Aymara arrived in the region. Present-day Aymara associate themselves with an advanced civilization situated at <!--del_lnk--> Tiwanaku, in Western Bolivia. The capital city of Tiwanaku dates from as early as 1500 BC when it was a small agriculturally based village.</p>
       <p>The community grew to urban proportions between AD 600 and AD 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a>. According to early estimates the city covered approximately 6.5 square kilometers at its maximum extent, and had between 15,000 &ndash; 30,000 inhabitants. In 1996 satellite imaging was used to map the extent of fossilized suka kollus (flooded raised fields) across the three primary valleys of Tiwanaku, arriving at population-carrying capacity estimates of anywhere between 285,000 and 1,482,000 people.</p>
       <p>Around AD 400, Tiwanaku went from being a locally dominant force to a predatory state. Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects. In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.</p>
       <p>The empire continued to grow with no end in sight. William H. Isbell states that "Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between AD 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population." Tiwanaku continued to absorb cultures rather than eradicate them. Archaeologists note a dramatic adoption of Tiwanaku ceramics into the cultures which became part of the Tiwanaku empire. Tiwanaku's power was further solidified through the trade it implemented among the cities within its empire.</p>
       <p>Tiwanaku's elites gained their status through the surplus food they controlled, collected from outlying regions and then redistributed to the general populace. Further, this elite's control of <!--del_lnk--> llama herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites. Through this control and manipulation of surplus resources, the elite's power continued to grow until about AD 950. At this time a dramatic shift in climate occurred, causing a significant drop in precipitation in the Titicaca Basin, believed by archaeologists to have been on the scale of a major drought.</p>
       <p>As the rainfall decreased, many of the cities further away from Lake Titicaca began to tender less foodstuffs to the elites. As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the power elite's control, dried up. The area remained uninhabited for centuries thereafter.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Between 1438 and 1527, the Inca empire, during its last great expansion, gained control over much of what is now western Bolivia. The Incas would not maintain control of the region for long, as the rapidly expanding Inca Empire was internally weak.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Colonial_period">Colonial period</span></h3>
       <p>The Spanish conquest of the Inca empire began in 1524, and was mostly completed by 1533. The territory now called Bolivia was known as "Upper Peru", and was under the authority of the Viceroy of <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a>. Local government came from the <!--del_lnk--> Audiencia de Charcas located in Chuquisaca (La Plata&mdash;modern <a href="../../wp/s/Sucre.htm" title="Sucre">Sucre</a>). Founded in 1545 as a mining town, <!--del_lnk--> Potos&iacute; soon produced fabulous wealth, becoming the largest city in the New World with a population exceeding 150,000 people.</p>
       <p>By the late 16th century Bolivian <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> was an important source of revenue for the <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_Empire.htm" title="Spanish Empire">Spanish Empire</a>.

Upper Peru was bounded to <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of the R&iacute;o de la Plata in 1776. <!--del_lnk--> T&uacute;pac Katari led the indigenous rebellion that laid siege to <a href="../../wp/l/La_Paz.htm" title="La Paz">La Paz</a> in March 1781, during which 20,000 people died.

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> struggle for independence started in the city of <a href="../../wp/s/Sucre.htm" title="Sucre">Sucre</a> the 25 May 1809, with the first cry of Freedom in Latin America. <!--del_lnk--> Chuquisaca Revolution (Chuquisaca was then the name of the city). That revolution, which created a local government Junta, was followed by the <!--del_lnk--> La Paz revolution, during which Bolivia actually declared independence. Both revolutions were short-lived, and defeated by the Spanish authorities, but the following year the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish American wars of independence raged across the continent. Bolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the <!--del_lnk--> royalists and <!--del_lnk--> patriots. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Jos&eacute; de Sucre, with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of <!--del_lnk--> Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var. After 16 years of war the Republic was <!--del_lnk--> proclaimed on 6 August 1825.</p>

       <p>In 1836, Bolivia, under the rule of <!--del_lnk--> Marshal <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute;s de Santa Cruz, invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president, <!--del_lnk--> General <!--del_lnk--> Luis Jos&eacute; de Orbegoso. Peru and Bolivia formed the <!--del_lnk--> Peru-Bolivian Confederation, with de Santa Cruz as the <i>Supreme Protector</i>. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina, Chile's ally, declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Confederation: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of <!--del_lnk--> Paucarpata near the city of <!--del_lnk--> Arequipa.</p>
       <p>On the same field, the Chilean and Peruvian rebel army surrendered unconditionally and signed the <!--del_lnk--> Paucarpata Treaty. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. In Chile, public outrage over the treaty forced the government to reject it. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Yungay. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.</p>
       <p>Following the independence of Peru, Peruvian president General <!--del_lnk--> Agust&iacute;n Gamarra invaded Bolivia. The Peruvian army was decisively defeated at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Ingavi on 20 November 1841 where Gamarra was killed. The Bolivian army under General <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Ballivi&aacute;n then mounted a counter-offensive, capturing the Peruvian port of <!--del_lnk--> Arica. Later, both sides signed a <!--del_lnk--> peace treaty in 1842, putting a final end to the war.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_instability_and_continued_wars">Economic instability and continued wars</span></h3>
       <p>A period of political and economic instability in the early-to-mid-19th century weakened Bolivia. Then in the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Pacific (1879&ndash;83) against Chile, it lost its access to the sea and the adjoining rich <i>salitre</i> (<!--del_lnk--> saltpeter) fields, together with the port of <!--del_lnk--> Antofagasta.</p>
       <p>Since independence, Bolivia has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries in wars and as a consequence of internal strife. It also lost the <!--del_lnk--> state of Acre, in the Acre War; important because this region was known for its production of rubber. Peasants and the Bolivian army fought briefly but after a few victories, and facing the prospect of a total war against Brazil, it was forced to sign the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Petr&oacute;polis in 1903, in which Bolivia lost this rich territory. Popular myth has it that Bolivian president Mariano Melgarejo (1864&ndash;71) traded the land for what he called "a magnificent white horse" and Acre was subsequently flooded by Brazilians which ultimately led to confrontation and fear of war with Brazil.</p>
       <p>In the late 19th century, an increase in the world price of gold brought Bolivia relative prosperity and political stability. During the early 20th century, <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a> replaced gold as the country's most important source of wealth. A succession of governments controlled by the economic and social elite followed <!--del_lnk--> laissez-faire capitalist policies through the first thirty years of the 20th century.</p>
       <p>Living conditions of the native people, who constitute most of the population, remained deplorable. With work opportunities limited to primitive conditions in the mines and in large estates having nearly feudal status, they had no access to education, economic opportunity, and <!--del_lnk--> political participation. Bolivia's defeat by Paraguay in the <!--del_lnk--> Chaco War (1932&ndash;35), where Bolivia lost a great part of the <!--del_lnk--> Gran Chaco region in dispute, marked a turning-point.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR), the most historic political party, emerged as a broad-based party. Denied its victory in the 1951 presidential elections, the MNR led a successful revolution in 1952. Under President <!--del_lnk--> V&iacute;ctor Paz Estenssoro, the MNR, having strong popular pressure, introduced <!--del_lnk--> universal suffrage into his political platform and carried out a sweeping land-reform promoting rural education and nationalization of the country's largest tin mines.</p>
       <p>12 years of tumultuous rule left the MNR divided. In 1964, a military <a href="../../wp/m/Military_dictatorship.htm" title="Military dictatorship">junta</a> overthrew President Estenssoro at the outset of his third term. The 1969 death of President <!--del_lnk--> Ren&eacute; Barrientos Ortu&ntilde;o, a former member of the junta who was elected president in 1966, led to a succession of weak governments.

The CIA reported that Guevara was captured on 8 October as a result of the clash with the Cuban-led guerrillas. He had a wound in his leg, but was otherwise in fair condition. At 1150 hours on 9 October the Second Ranger Battalion received direct orders from Bolivian Army Headquarters in La Paz to kill Guevara. These orders were carried out at 1315 hours the same day with a burst of fire from an M-2 automatic rifle. <!--del_lnk--> F&eacute;lix Rodr&iacute;guez was a CIA officer on the team with the Bolivian Army that captured and shot Guevara. Rodriguez said that after he received a Bolivian presidential execution order, he told "the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully, to remain consistent with the Bolivian government's story that Che had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army." Rodriguez said the US government had wanted Che in Panama, and "I could have tried to falsify the command to the troops, and got Che to Panama as the US government said they had wanted", said Mr Rodriguez, but he chose to "let history run its course" as desired by Bolivia."</p>

       <p>Elections in 1979 and 1981 were inconclusive and marked by fraud. There were coups d'&eacute;tat, counter-coups, and caretaker governments. In 1980, General <!--del_lnk--> Luis Garc&iacute;a Meza Tejada carried out a ruthless and violent coup d'&eacute;tat that did not have popular support. He pacified the people by promising to remain in power only for one year. At the end of the year, he staged a televised rally to claim popular support and announced, "<i>Bueno, me quedo</i>", or, "All right; I'll stay [in office]." He was deposed shortly thereafter. His government was notorious for human rights abuses, <!--del_lnk--> drug-trafficking, and economic mismanagement; during his presidency, the inflation that later crippled the Bolivian economy could already be felt. Later convicted in absentia for various crimes by attorney <!--del_lnk--> Juan del Granado, including murder, Garc&iacute;a Meza was extradited from Brazil and began serving a 30-year prison sentence in 1995.</p>
       <p>After a military rebellion forced out Meza in 1981, three other military governments in 14 months struggled with Bolivia's growing problems. Unrest forced the military to convoke the <!--del_lnk--> Congress elected in 1980 and allow it to choose a new chief executive.

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Gonzalo S&aacute;nchez de Lozada pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda. The most dramatic reform was the "capitalization" program, under which investors, typically foreign, acquired 50% ownership and management control of public enterprises, such as the state petroleum corporation, telecommunications system, airlines, <!--del_lnk--> railroads, and electric utilities, in return for agreed upon capital investments.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society, which instigated frequent and sometimes violent protests, particularly in La Paz and the Chapare <!--del_lnk--> coca-growing region, from 1994 through 1996. The de Lozada government pursued a policy of offering monetary compensation for voluntary eradication of illegal coca by its growers in the Chapare region. The policy produced little net reduction in coca, and in the mid-1990s Bolivia accounted for about one-third of the world's coca that was being processed into <!--del_lnk--> cocaine. The coca leaf has long been part of the Bolivian culture, as indigenous workers have traditionally used the leaf for its properties as a mild stimulant and appetite suppressant.</p>
       <p>During this time, the umbrella labor-organization of Bolivia, the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), became increasingly unable to effectively challenge government policy. A teachers' strike in 1995 was defeated because the COB could not marshal the support of many of its members, including construction and factory workers. The state also used selective martial law to keep the disruptions caused by the teachers to a minimum. The teachers were led by <!--del_lnk--> Trotskyites, and were considered to be the most militant union in the COB. Their downfall was a major blow to the COB, which also became mired in internal corruption and infighting in 1996.</p>
       <p>In the 1997 elections, General <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Banzer, leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Nationalist Democratic Action party (ADN) and former dictator (1971&ndash;78), won 22% of the vote, while the MNR candidate won 18%. General Banzer formed a coalition of the ADN, MIR, UCS, and CONDEPA parties, which held a majority of seats in the Bolivian Congress. The Congress elected him as president, and he was inaugurated on 6 August 1997. During the election campaign, Banzer had promised to suspend the privatization of the state-owned oil-company, YPFB. But this seemed unlikely to happen, considering Bolivia's weak position globally. The Banzer government basically continued the free-market and privatization-policies of its predecessor.</p>
       <p>The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.</p>
       <p>At the outset of his government, President Banzer launched a policy of using special police-units to physically eradicate the illegal coca of the Chapare region. The policy produced a sudden and dramatic four-year decline in Bolivia's illegal coca crop, to the point that Bolivia became a relatively small supplier of coca for cocaine. Those left unemployed by coca eradication streamed into the cities, especially El Alto, the slum-neighbourhood of La Paz. The MIR of Jaime Paz Zamora remained a coalition-partner throughout the Banzer government, supporting this policy (called the Dignity Plan).</p>
       <p>Between January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale <!--del_lnk--> protests erupted in <!--del_lnk--> Cochabamba, Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the privatization of water resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices.</p>
       <p>On 6 August 2001, Banzer resigned from office after being diagnosed with cancer. He died less than a year later. Vice President <!--del_lnk--> Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ram&iacute;rez completed the final year of his term.</p>
       <p>In the June 2002 national elections, former President Gonzalo S&aacute;nchez de Lozada (MNR) placed first with 22.5% of the vote, followed by coca-advocate and native peasant-leader <!--del_lnk--> Evo Morales (<!--del_lnk--> Movement Toward Socialism, MAS) with 20.9%. Morales edged out populist candidate <!--del_lnk--> Manfred Reyes Villa of the <!--del_lnk--> New Republican Force (NFR) by just 700 votes nationwide, earning a spot in the congressional run-off against S&aacute;nchez de Lozada on 4 August 2002.</p>
       <p>A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of S&aacute;nchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time. The MNR platform featured three overarching objectives: economic reactivation (and job creation), anti-<!--del_lnk--> corruption, and social inclusion.</p>

       <p>In 2003 the <!--del_lnk--> Bolivian gas conflict broke out. On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes which erupted when a caravan of oil trucks escorted by police and soldiers deploying tanks and heavy-caliber machine guns tried to breach a barricade. On 17 October 2003 Evo Morales' supporters from <!--del_lnk--> Cochabamba tried to march into <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the largest city of the eastern lowlands where support was strong for the president. They were turned back. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, Sanchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Mesa, invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.</p>
       <p>In March 2004, the new president Carlos Mesa announced that his government would hold a series of rallies around the country, and at its embassies abroad, demanding that Chile return to Bolivia a stretch of seacoast that the country lost in 1884 after the end of the War of the Pacific. Chile has traditionally refused to negotiate on the issue, but Mesa nonetheless made this policy a central point of his administration.</p>
       <p>The country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Rodr&iacute;guez, was sworn as interim president to succeed the outgoing Carlos Mesa.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plan_de_Todos"><i>Plan de Todos</i></span></h3>
       <p>Mobilizing against <!--del_lnk--> neoliberalism as an enemy of socialism, the indigenous population of the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andean</a> region was able to achieve widespread government reform. Bolivia, in particular, was quite successful due to the prominence of an indigenous population and the persistence of reformist policies. In 1993, <!--del_lnk--> Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada ran for <!--del_lnk--> president in alliance with the <!--del_lnk--> Tupac Katari Revolutionary Liberation Movement, which inspired indigenous-sensitive and multicultural-aware policies. Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (colloquially known as Goni) was able to shift Bolivian society by selling state firms and constitutionally acknowledging the existence of a multicultural and multiethnic population. Current development has led to a neoliberal citizenship regime in which <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Civil_and_political_rights.htm" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> are expressed through <!--del_lnk--> private property ownership, formal democracy and <!--del_lnk--> representation, and an investment in the maintaining of infrastructure.</p>
       <p>In the 1990s, Bolivia introduced, the <i>Plan de Todos</i>, which led to the decentralization of government, introduction of <!--del_lnk--> intercultural bilingual education, implementation of <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agrarian</a> <!--del_lnk--> legislation, and <!--del_lnk--> privatization of state owned businesses. The <i>Plan de Todos</i> main incentive was to encourage popular participation among the <!--del_lnk--> Bolivian people. The law recognizes the existence of <!--del_lnk--> barrios and rural communities as <!--del_lnk--> Territorially Based Organizations (TBOs) and has oversight boards known as <i>r&oacute;miles de agilancia</i>, or vigilance committees, that are responsible for overseeing <!--del_lnk--> municipal governments and planning projects. The <i>Plan</i> formally acknowledged the existence of 311 <!--del_lnk--> municipalities, which benefited directly based on the size of their populations. The <i>Plan de Todos</i> inspired the development of a <!--del_lnk--> market democracy with minimally regulated capitalist economy. The <i>Plan</i> explicitly stated that Bolivian citizens would own a minimum of 51% of enterprises; under the Plan, most <!--del_lnk--> state owned enterprises (SOEs), besides mines, were sold. This privatization of SOEs led to innovative neoliberal structuring that acknowledged a diverse population within Bolivia.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Law of Popular Participation gave municipalities the responsibility of maintaining various infrastructures (and offering services): health, education, systems of irrigation, which stripped the responsibility away from the state. The state provides municipalities with 20% of federal <!--del_lnk--> tax revenue so that each municipality can adequately maintain these infrastructures. The Law also redistributes political power to the local level.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The main candidates for the <!--del_lnk--> 2005 Bolivian presidential election held on 18 December 2005 were <!--del_lnk--> Juan Evo Morales Ayma of the MAS Party and <!--del_lnk--> Jorge Quiroga, leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Social and Democratic Power (PODEMOS) Party and former head of the <!--del_lnk--> Acci&oacute;n Democr&aacute;tica Nacionalista (ADN) Party. Morales won the election with 53.7% of the votes, an <!--del_lnk--> absolute majority, unusual in Bolivian elections. He was sworn in on 22 January 2006, for a five-year term. Prior to his official inauguration in La Paz, he was inaugurated in an <!--del_lnk--> Aymara ritual at the archeological site of <!--del_lnk--> Tiwanaku before a crowd of thousands of Aymara people and representatives of leftist movements from across Latin America. Though highly symbolic, this ritual was not historically based and primarily represented native Aymaras &mdash; not the main Quechua-speaking population. Since the Spanish conquest in the early 16th century, this region of South America, with a majority native population, has been ruled mostly by descendants of European immigrants.</p>
       <p>On 1 May 2006, Morales caused controversy when he announced his intent to <!--del_lnk--> re-nationalize Bolivian hydrocarbon assets. While stating that the initiative would not be an expropriation, Morales sent Bolivian troops to occupy 56 gas installations simultaneously, including the two <!--del_lnk--> Petrobras-owned refineries which provide over 90% of Bolivia's refining-capacity. All foreign energy firms were required to sign new contracts within 180 days, giving Bolivia majority ownership and up to 82% of revenues for the largest natural gas fields. All such firms signed new contracts. Reports from the Bolivian government and the companies involved are contradictory as to plans for future investment.</p>
       <p>By far the biggest customer for Bolivian hydrocarbons has been Brazil, which imports two-thirds of Bolivia's natural gas via <!--del_lnk--> pipelines operated by the semi-private Petrobras. Since gas can only be exported from landlocked Bolivia via Petrobras' large (and expensive) pipelines, the supplier and customer are strongly linked. Petrobras has announced plans to produce enough natural gas by 2011 to replace that now supplied by Bolivia. Bolivia's position is strengthened by the knowledge that hydrocarbon reserves are more highly valued now than at the times of previous nationalizations, and by the pledged support of leftist President <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Ch&aacute;vez of <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>.</p>
       <p>Fulfilling a campaign promise, on 6 August 2006, Morales opened the <!--del_lnk--> Bolivian Constituent Assembly to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority. Problems immediately arose when, unable to garner the two-thirds majority needed to include controversial provisions in the constitutional draft, Morales' party announced that only a simple majority would be needed to draft individual articles while a two-thirds majority would be needed to pass the document in full. Violent protests arose in December 2006 in parts of the country for both two-thirds and departmental autonomy, mostly in the eastern third of the country, where much of the hydrocarbon wealth is located. MAS and its supporters believed the two-thirds voting requirement would give an effective veto for all constitutional changes to the conservative minority.</p>
       <p>In August 2007, more conflicts arose in Sucre, as the city demanded the discussion of the seat of government inside the assembly, hoping the executive and legislative branches could return to the city, but the assembly and the government said this demand was overwhelmingly impractical and politically undesirable. The conflict turned into violence, and the assembly was moved to a military area in Oruro. Although the main opposition party boycotted the session, a constitutional draft was approved on 24 November.</p>
       <p>In May 2008, Evo Morales was a signatory to the <!--del_lnk--> UNASUR Constitutive Treaty of the <!--del_lnk--> Union of South American Nations. Bolivia has ratified the treaty.</p>
       <p>In the 2009 national general elections, Evo Morales was re-elected with 64.22% of the vote. His party, <!--del_lnk--> Movement for Socialism, also won a two-thirds majority in both houses of the <!--del_lnk--> National Congress.</p>

       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Maritime_claims_and_rights">Maritime claims and rights</span></h3>
       <p>Despite losing its maritime coast, the so-called <i>Littoral Department</i>, after the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Pacific, Bolivia has historically maintained, as a state policy, a maritime claim to <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>; the claim asks for sovereign access to the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and its maritime space. The <i>Political Constitution of 2009</i> established that Bolivia declares its right to access to the sea, and that its objective is to solve the problem peacefully.</p>
       <p>Since the foundation of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> in 1945, Bolivia has requested the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_General_Assembly.htm" title="United Nations General Assembly">General Assembly</a> to consider its petition for sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. The issue has also been presented before the <!--del_lnk--> Organization of American States; in 1979, the OAS passed the <i>426 Resolution</i>, which declared that the Bolivian problem is a hemispheric problem. Chile has tried to assist in the matter, but without yielding any of its sovereign territory.</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Access to the Pacific Ocean by Chile</b>. On 4 April 1884, a truce was signed with Chile, whereby Chile gave facilities of access to Bolivian products through <!--del_lnk--> Antofagasta, and freed the payment of export rights in the port of <!--del_lnk--> Arica. In October 1904, the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Peace and Friendship was signed, and Chile agreed to build a <!--del_lnk--> railway between Arica and La Paz, to improve access of Bolivian products to the ports.</li>
        <li><b>Access to the Pacific Ocean by Peru</b>. The <i>Special Economical Zone for Bolivia in Ilo</i> (ZEEBI) is a special economic area of 5&nbsp;km of maritime coast, and a total extension of 358 <!--del_lnk--> hectares, called Mar Bolivia ("Sea Bolivia"), where Bolivia may maintain a free port near <!--del_lnk--> Ilo, <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a> under its administration and operation for a period of 99 years starting on 1992; once the time has passed, all the construction and territory go back to the Peruvian government.</li>
        <li><b>Access to the Atlantic Ocean by Argentina</b>. Since 1964, Bolivia has had its own port facilities in the <i>Bolivian Free Port</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Rosario, <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. This port is located on the <!--del_lnk--> Paran&aacute; River, which is directly connected to the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>.</li>

       <p>Bolivia is located in the central zone of <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>, between the meridians 57&deg; 26&acute; and 69&deg; 38&acute; longitude west of the Prime Meridian, and the parallels 9&deg; 38&acute; and 22&deg; 53&acute; of southern latitude. At 1,098,580 square kilometres (424,160 sq mi), Bolivia is the world's 28th-largest country. Its surface extends from the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Central Andes</a>, going partially through the <i><!--del_lnk--> Gran Chaco</i>, as far as the <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_rainforest.htm" title="Amazon rainforest">Amazon</a>. The geographic centre of the country is the so-called <i>Puerto Estrella</i> ("Star Port") on the <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o Grande, in <!--del_lnk--> &Ntilde;uflo de Ch&aacute;vez Province, <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz Department.</p>
       <p>The geographic location of the country comprises a great variety of terrains and climates. Bolivia has a huge degree of <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, considered one of the greatest in the world; as well as several <!--del_lnk--> ecoregions with such ecological subunits as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Altiplano</i>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_rainforest.htm" title="Tropical rainforest">tropical rainforests</a> (including <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_rainforest.htm" title="Amazon rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a>), dry <!--del_lnk--> valleys, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Chiquitania</i>, which is a <!--del_lnk--> tropical savanna. All of these feature enormous variations in altitude, from an elevation of 6,542 meters above sea level in <!--del_lnk--> Nevado Sajama, to nearly 70 meters along the <!--del_lnk--> Paraguay River. Despite this great geographic contrast, Bolivia has remained a <!--del_lnk--> landlocked country since the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Pacific.</p>

       <p>Bolivia can be divided into three <!--del_lnk--> physiographic regions:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Andean Region: in the southwest; it spans 28% of the national territory, extending over 307,603 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;. This area is located above 3000 meters altitude, and is located between two big Andean chains: the <i><!--del_lnk--> Cordillera Occidental</i> ("western range") and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Cordillera Central</i> ("central range"), with some of the highest spots in the <!--del_lnk--> Americas, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Nevado Sajama, with 6,542 meters, and the <!--del_lnk--> Illimani with 6,462 meters. Here also is located <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Titicaca.htm" title="Lake Titicaca">Lake Titicaca</a>, the highest commercially navigable lake in the world, and also the largest lake in South America, shared with <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>. Also in this region are the <i><!--del_lnk--> Altiplano</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Salar de Uyuni</i>, which is the largest <!--del_lnk--> salt flat of the world and an important source of <a href="../../wp/l/Lithium.htm" title="Lithium">lithium</a>.</li>
        <li>Sub-Andean region: in the centre and south; an intermediate region between the <i><!--del_lnk--> Altiplano</i> and the eastern <i><!--del_lnk--> llanos</i>, it comprises 13% of the territory, extending over 142,815&nbsp;km&sup2;. It encompasses the Bolivian valleys and the Yungas region. It is distinguished by its farming activities and its temperate climate.</li>
        <li>Llanos region: in the northeast; it comprises 59% of the territory with 648,163&nbsp;km&sup2;. It is located to the north of the <!--del_lnk--> Cordillera Central; it extends from the Andean foothills to the <!--del_lnk--> Paraguay River. It is a region of flatland and small plateaus, all covered by extensive rainforests with enormous biodiversity. The region is located below 400 meters above sea level.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Hydrography">Hydrography</span></h3>
       <p>Bolivia has three <!--del_lnk--> drainage basins that flow into the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> or the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>.</p>
       <ul>
        <li><a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_River.htm" title="Amazon River">Amazon Basin</a>, also called the North Basin (724,000&nbsp;km&sup2; / 66% of the territory). The rivers of this basin generally have big <a href="../../wp/m/Meander.htm" title="Meander">meanders</a>, thereby forming lakes such as the <!--del_lnk--> Murillo Lake in <!--del_lnk--> Pando Department. The main Bolivian <!--del_lnk--> tributary to the Amazon basin is the <!--del_lnk--> Mamor&eacute; River, with a length of 2000&nbsp;km running north to the confluence with the <!--del_lnk--> Beni River, 1,113&nbsp;km of length and the second most important river of the country. The Beni River, along with the <!--del_lnk--> Madeira River, forms the main tributary of the <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_River.htm" title="Amazon River">Amazon River</a>. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers such as the <!--del_lnk--> Madre de Dios River, <!--del_lnk--> Orthon River, <!--del_lnk--> Abuna River, <!--del_lnk--> Yata River and the <!--del_lnk--> Guapor&eacute; River. The most important lakes are the <!--del_lnk--> Rogaguado Lake, the <!--del_lnk--> Rogagua Lake and the <!--del_lnk--> Jara Lake.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Rio de la Plata Basin, also called the South Basin (229,500&nbsp;km&sup2; / 21% of the territory). The tributaries are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon basin. It is mainly formed by the <!--del_lnk--> Paraguay River, <!--del_lnk--> Pilcomayo River and <!--del_lnk--> Bermejo River. The most important lakes are the <!--del_lnk--> Uberaba Lake and the <!--del_lnk--> Mandior&eacute; Lake, both located in the Bolivian marshland.</li>
        <li>The Central Basin, which is an <!--del_lnk--> endorrheic basin (145,081&nbsp;km&sup2; / 13% of the territory). The <i><!--del_lnk--> Altiplano</i> has large numbers of lakes and rivers that do not run into any ocean, as they are enclosed by the Andean mountains. The most important river is the <!--del_lnk--> Desaguadero River, with a length of 436&nbsp;km, the longest river of the <i>Altiplano</i>; it begins in <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Titicaca.htm" title="Lake Titicaca">Lake Titicaca</a> and then runs in a southeast direction to the <!--del_lnk--> Poop&oacute; Lake. The basin is then formed by the Lake Titicaca, Lake Poop&oacute;, the Desaguadero River and great salt flats as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Salar de Uyuni</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> Coipasa Lake.</li>

       <p>Bolivia is part of the "<!--del_lnk--> Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries", and has an enormous variety of <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a> and <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems.</p>
       <p>Bolivia's variable altitudes, ranging from 90 to 6,542 meters above sea level, allow for a vast biologic diversity. The territory of Bolivia comprises 4 types of <a href="../../wp/b/Biome.htm" title="Biome">biomes</a>, 32 ecological regions, and 199 ecosystems. Within this geographic area there are several natural parks and reserves, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, the <!--del_lnk--> Madidi National Park, the <!--del_lnk--> Tunari National Park, the <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve, and the <!--del_lnk--> Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area, among others.</p>
       <p>The biodiversity of species may be divided into:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Plants: Bolivia boasts over 200,000 species of seeds, including over 1,200 species of <a href="../../wp/f/Fern.htm" title="Fern">fern</a>, 1,500 species of <i><!--del_lnk--> marchantiophyta</i> and <a href="../../wp/m/Moss.htm" title="Moss">moss</a>, and at least 800 species of <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungus</a>. In addition, there are more than 3,000 species of <!--del_lnk--> medicinal plants. Bolivia is considered the place of origin for such species as <!--del_lnk--> peppers and <!--del_lnk--> chilli peppers, the <a href="../../wp/p/Peanut.htm" title="Peanut">peanut</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> common bean, the <!--del_lnk--> yucca, and several species of palm. Bolivia also naturally produces over 4,000 kinds of <a href="../../wp/p/Potato.htm" title="Potato">potato</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="../../wp/v/Vertebrate.htm" title="Vertebrate">Vertebrates</a>: Bolivia has more than 2,900 species, including 398 mammals, over 1,400 birds (70% of birds known in the world, being the sixth most diverse country ), 204 <!--del_lnk--> amphibians, 277 <a href="../../wp/r/Reptile.htm" title="Reptile">reptiles</a>, and 635 <!--del_lnk--> fresh water fish (as Bolivia is a <!--del_lnk--> landlocked country). In addition, there are more than 3,000 types of <!--del_lnk--> butterfly, and more than 60 <!--del_lnk--> domestic animals.</li>

       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
       <p>Bolivia&rsquo;s estimated 2011 gross domestic product (GDP) totaled $23.3 billion. Economic growth was estimated at about 5.1%, and inflation was estimated at about 6.9%. The increase in GDP primarily reflected contributions from oil and gas production (7.9%); electricity, water, and gas distribution (7.6%); construction (7.2%); transport and communications (6.0%); and financial services (5.5%). Exports rose by more than 30% between 2010 and 2011 to $9.1 billion, due mostly to increased commodity prices, not increased volume. In 2011, Bolivia&rsquo;s top export products were: hydrocarbons (45% of total exports), minerals (27%), manufactured goods (24%), and agricultural products (4%). Bolivia&rsquo;s trade with neighboring countries is growing, in part because of several regional preferential trade agreements. Bolivia&rsquo;s top trading partners in 2011 in terms of exports were Brazil (33%), Argentina (11%), United States (10%), Japan (6%), Peru (5%), South Korea (5%), Belgium (4%), China (3%), and Venezuela (3%). From 2010 to 2011, Bolivian imports rose by 41% to a total of $7.6 billion. Bolivia imports many industrial supplies and inputs such as replacement parts, chemicals, software, and other production items (31% of total imports), capital goods (21%), fuel (13%), and consumer goods (10%).</p>
       <p>Bolivia's 2002 gross domestic product (GDP) totaled USD $7.9&nbsp;billion. Economic growth was about 2.5% per year, and inflation was between 3% and 4% in 2002 (it was under 2% in 2001). Bolivia was rated 'Repressed' by the 2010 <!--del_lnk--> Index of Economic Freedom. Despite a series of mostly political setbacks, between 2006 and 2009 the Morales administration has spurred growth higher than at any point in the preceding 30 years. The growth was accompanied by a moderate decrease in inequality.</p>
       <p>Bolivia's current economic situation remains lackluster, a factor that can be linked to several factors from the past three decades. The first major blow to the Bolivian economy came with a dramatic fall in the price of tin during the early 1980s, which impacted one of Bolivia's main sources of income and one of its major mining-industries. The second major economic blow came at the end of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> in the late 1980s and early 1990s as economic aid was withdrawn by western countries who had previously tried to keep a market-liberal regime in power through financial support.</p>

       <p>Since 1985, the government of Bolivia has implemented a far-reaching program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price stability, creating conditions for sustained growth, and alleviating scarcity. A major reform of the customs service has significantly improved transparency in this area. Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market-liberal policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors, that have encouraged private investment. Foreign investors are accorded national treatment, and foreign ownership of companies enjoys virtually no restrictions in Bolivia.</p>
       <p>Bolivia has the second largest <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> reserves in South America. The government has a long-term sales-agreement to sell natural gas to Brazil through 2019. The government held a binding referendum in 2005 on the Hydrocarbon Law.</p>
       <p>The US Geological Service estimates that Bolivia has 5.4&nbsp;million <!--del_lnk--> cubic tonnes of <a href="../../wp/l/Lithium.htm" title="Lithium">lithium</a> which represents 50%&ndash;70% of world reserves. The light metal is used to make high-capacity batteries used in electric cars and such. The spinoff effect of lithium mining could cause Bolivia to become the "Saudi Arabia of the Green World." However, to mine for it would involve disturbing the country's salt flats (called <!--del_lnk--> Salar de Uyuni), an important natural feature which boosts tourism in the region. The government does not want to destroy this unique natural landscape to meet the rising world demand for lithium.</p>

       <p>In April 2000, Hugo Banzer, the former President of Bolivia, signed a contract with Aguas del Tunari, a private consortium, to operate and improve the water supply in Bolivia's third-largest city, <!--del_lnk--> Cochabamba. Shortly thereafter, the company tripled the water rates in that city, an action which resulted in <!--del_lnk--> protests and rioting among those who could no longer afford clean water. Amidst Bolivia's nationwide economic collapse and growing national unrest over the state of the economy, the Bolivian government was forced to withdraw the water contract.</p>
       <p>Bolivian commercial exports were $1.3&nbsp;billion in 2002, from a low of $652&nbsp;million in 1991. Imports were $1.7&nbsp;billion in 2002. Bolivian <!--del_lnk--> tariffs are a uniformly low 10%, with capital equipment charged only 5%. Bolivia's trade-deficit was $460&nbsp;million in 2002.</p>
       <p>Bolivia's trade with neighboring countries is growing, in part because of several regional preferential trade agreements it has negotiated. Bolivia is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Andean Community of Nations and enjoys nominally free trade with other member countries.</p>
       <p>The United States remains Bolivia's largest trading partner (excepting natural resources, such as natural gas). In 2002, the United States exported $283&nbsp;million of merchandise to Bolivia and imported $162&nbsp;million.</p>
       <p>Agriculture accounts for roughly 15% of Bolivia's GDP. Soybeans are the major <!--del_lnk--> cash crop, sold into the Andean Community market. <!--del_lnk--> Bolivian coca growing is both economically and political important.</p>
       <p>Bolivia's government remains heavily dependent on foreign assistance to finance development projects. At the end of 2002, the government owed $4.5&nbsp;billion to its foreign <!--del_lnk--> creditors, with $1.6&nbsp;billion of this amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to multilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the <!--del_lnk--> Paris Club mechanism. External creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian government has generally achieved the monetary and fiscal targets set by IMF programs since 1987, though economic crises have undercut Bolivia's normally good record.</p>
       <p>The rescheduling of agreements granted by the Paris Club has allowed the individual creditor countries to apply very soft terms to the rescheduled debt. As a result, some countries have forgiven substantial amounts of Bolivia's bilateral debt. The U.S. government reached an agreement at the Paris Club meeting in December 1995 that reduced by 67% Bolivia's existing debt stock. The Bolivian government continues to pay its debts to the multilateral development banks on time. Bolivia is a beneficiary of the <!--del_lnk--> Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC debt relief programs, which by agreement restricts Bolivia's access to new soft loans.</p>
       <p>The income from tourism becomes increasingly important. <!--del_lnk--> Bolivia's tourist industry has grown gradually since about 1990.</p>

       <p>According to the Bolivian National Statistics Institute, the censed inhabitants in 2001 were 8,274,325 from which 4,123,850 were men and 4,150,475 were women, as of 2010 the number reached 10,125,522 inhabitants.</p>
       <p>In the last fifty years the Bolivian population has tripled; reaching a population growth rate of 2.25%. The growth of the population in the inter-census periods (1950&ndash;1976 and 1976&ndash;1992) was approximately 2.05%, while between the last period, 1992&ndash;2001, it reached 2.74% annually.</p>
       <p>62.43% of Bolivians live in urban areas, while the remaining 37.57% in rural areas. The most part of the population (70%) is concentrated in the departments of <!--del_lnk--> La Paz, <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz and <!--del_lnk--> Cochabamba. In the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andean</a> <!--del_lnk--> Altiplano region the departments of La Paz and <!--del_lnk--> Oruro hold the largest percentage of population, in the valley region the largest percentage is held by the departments of Cochabamba and <!--del_lnk--> Chuquisaca, while in the Llanos region by Santa Cruz and <!--del_lnk--> Beni. At national level, the population density is 8,49, with variations marked between 0,8 (<!--del_lnk--> Pando Department) and 26,2 (Cochabamba Department).</p>

       <p>The ethnic composition of Bolivia includes a great diversity of cultures. Most of the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples have assimilated a <a href="../../wp/m/Mestizo.htm" title="Mestizo">mestizo</a> culture, diversifying and expanding their indigenous heritage. Consequently, there is in Bolivia a mix of cultures, which joins together <!--del_lnk--> Hispanic and <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian cultures.</p>
       <p>The ethnic distribution of Bolivia is estimated to be 30% <!--del_lnk--> Quechua-speaking and 25% <!--del_lnk--> Aymara-speaking. The largest of the approximately three dozen native groups are the <!--del_lnk--> Quechuas (2.5&nbsp;million), <!--del_lnk--> Aymaras (2&nbsp;million), then Chiquitano (180,000), and <!--del_lnk--> Guaran&iacute; (125,000). So the full <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian population is at 55%; the remaining 30% are <a href="../../wp/m/Mestizo.htm" title="Mestizo">mestizo</a> (mixed Amerindian and white), and around 15% are white.</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Indigenous, also called <i>"originarios"</i> ("native" or "original") and less frequently, <i>Amerindians</i>.

There also is an important oriental ethnic population, composed by the <!--del_lnk--> Guaran&iacute; and <!--del_lnk--> Moxos, among others, and that inhabit the departments of <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz, <!--del_lnk--> Beni, <!--del_lnk--> Tarija and <!--del_lnk--> Pando.

The Protestantism along with traditional indigenous beliefs are expanding rapidly.</p>
       <p>The number of Catholics is higher in urban areas than in rural regions, where Protestantism reaches its higher level, 20%. In the 2001 census, 2,5% stated not to have any religious affiliation and less than 0.2% stated to have different affiliations, such as <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Jehovah's Witnesses, <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;'&iacute;, <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Shinto.htm" title="Shinto">Shintoism</a>. There are 280 non-catholic religious organizations and more than 200 catholic groups registered by the Government.</p>

       <p>The Bolivian <a href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> has four <!--del_lnk--> Archdioceses, seven <!--del_lnk--> Dioceses, two <!--del_lnk--> Prelates, and five <!--del_lnk--> Apostolic vicariates.

       <p>Catholicism has been traditionally the religion with the bigger number of adherents in the country. Among the western indigenous peoples it has been part of a religious <!--del_lnk--> syncretism; in the last few decades however, Protestantism has become increasingly popular</p>
       <p>The oriental indigenous cultures, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Chiquitanos and <!--del_lnk--> Moxos, remains an important cultural link with Catholicism as a product of a cultural mix inherited as a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Jesuit Missions.</p>

        <dt>Indigenous beliefs</dt>
       </dl>
       <p>Most of the indigenous population follows different religions marked by their syncretism with the Catholic religion or complementary to it with their own world view and ancient traditions. It is important the cult to <!--del_lnk--> Pachamama, or "Mother Earth", as well as the adoration to the <!--del_lnk--> Virgin of Copacabana, Virgin of Urkupi&ntilde;a and Vigin of Socav&oacute;n. There also are important <!--del_lnk--> Aymaran communities near the <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Titicaca.htm" title="Lake Titicaca">Lake Titicaca</a> that have a strong devotion to <!--del_lnk--> James the Apostle. Other deities are the <!--del_lnk--> Ekeko, which is the Aymaran god of abundance and prosperity and which day is celebrated every 24 January, and <!--del_lnk--> Tup&aacute;, a god of the <!--del_lnk--> Guaran&iacute; people.</p>
       <p>Some indigenous communities have been trying to return to their ancient customs and beliefs removing Christian influence from their belief system. In 2009, the Government through Supreme Decrete decided to recognize the celebration of the Aymaran New Year, or <i>Wilka Kuti</i> (return of the Sun), event that celebrates the beginning of a new solar cycle with the arrival of the winter solstice. This event is celebrated in the ruins of <!--del_lnk--> Tiwanaku.</p>

       <p>Bolivia has been governed by democratically elected governments since 1982, when a long string of military coups came to an end. Presidents <!--del_lnk--> Hern&aacute;n Siles Zuazo (1982&ndash;85) and <!--del_lnk--> V&iacute;ctor Paz Estenssoro (1985&ndash;89) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: <!--del_lnk--> Gonzalo S&aacute;nchez de Lozada in 2003 and <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Mesa in 2005. Bolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the <!--del_lnk--> Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, <!--del_lnk--> National Democratic Action, and the <!--del_lnk--> Revolutionary Left Movement predominated from 1985 to 2005. The current president is <!--del_lnk--> Evo Morales, the first indigenous Bolivian to serve as head of state. Morales' <!--del_lnk--> Movement for Socialism &ndash; Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples party was the first to win an outright presidential majority in four decades, doing so both in 2005 and 2009.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> constitution, drafted in 2006&ndash;07 and approved in 2009, provides for balanced executive, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers, as well as several levels of autonomy. The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the <!--del_lnk--> Congress, whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Bolivia has its constitutionally recognized capital in Sucre, while La Paz is the seat of government. La Plata (now Sucre) was proclaimed provisional capital of the newly independent Alto Peru (later, Bolivia) on 1 July 1826. On 12 July 1839, President <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Miguel de Velasco proclaimed a law naming the city as the capital of Bolivia, and renaming it in honour of the revolutionary leader <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Jos&eacute; de Sucre. The Bolivian seat of government moved to <a href="../../wp/l/La_Paz.htm" title="La Paz">La Paz</a> at the turn of the twentieth century, as a consequence of Sucre's relative remoteness from economic activity after the decline of <!--del_lnk--> Potos&iacute; and its silver industry and of the Liberal Party in the War of 1899.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 2009 Constitution assigns the role of national capital to Sucre, not referring to La Paz in the text. In addition to being the constitutional capital, the Supreme Court of Bolivia is located in Sucre, making it the judicial capital. Nonetheless, the <!--del_lnk--> Palacio Quemado (the Presidential Palace and seat of Bolivian <!--del_lnk--> executive power) is located in La Paz, as are the National Congress and Plurinational Electoral Organ. La Paz thus continues to be the seat of government.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Executive_branch">Executive branch</span></h3>
       <p>The executive branch is headed by a President and Vice President, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government <!--del_lnk--> ministries. The president is elected to a five-year term by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Election.htm" title="Popular vote">popular vote</a>, and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, <i>Palacio Quemado</i>) in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an <!--del_lnk--> absolute majority of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Prisons">Prisons</span></h4>
       <p>There are 53 <!--del_lnk--> prisons in Bolivia which incarcerate around 8,700 people as of 2010. The prisons are managed by the Penitentiary Regime Directorate (Spanish: <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>Direcci&oacute;n de R&eacute;gimen Penintenciario</i></span>). There are 17 prisons in <!--del_lnk--> departmental capital cities and 36 provincial prisons.</p>

       <p>The <i>Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Plurinational Legislative Assembly or National Congress) has <!--del_lnk--> two chambers. The <i>C&aacute;mara de Diputados</i> (Chamber of Deputies) has 130 members elected to five-year terms, seventy from single-member districts (<i>circunscripciones</i>), sixty by proportional representation, and seven by the minority indigenous peoples of seven departments. The <i>C&aacute;mara de Senadores</i> (Chamber of Senators) has 36 members (four per department). Members of the Assembly are elected to five-year terms. The body has its headquarters on the Plaza Murillo in La Paz, but also holds honorary sessions elsewhere in Bolivia. The Vice President serves as titular head of the combined Assembly.</p>

       <p>The electoral branch of Bolivia's government, formally the <!--del_lnk--> Plurinational Electoral Organ, is an independent branch of government which replaced the <!--del_lnk--> National Electoral Court in 2010. The branch consists of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the nine Departmental Electoral Tribunals, Electoral Judges, the anonymously selected Juries at Election Tables, and Electoral Notaries. Wilfredo Ovando presides over the seven-member Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Its operations are mandated by the Constitution and regulated by the Electoral Regime Law (Law 026, passed 2010). The Organ's first elections were the country's first <!--del_lnk--> judicial election in October 2011, and five municipal special elections held in 2011.</p>

       <p>Bolivian culture has been heavily influenced by the Quechua, the Aymara, as well as by the popular cultures of Latin America as a whole.</p>
       <p>The cultural development is divided into three distinct periods: precolumbian, colonial, and republican. Important <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">archaeological</a> ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, <!--del_lnk--> ceramics, and <!--del_lnk--> weavings remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major ruins include <!--del_lnk--> Tiwanaku, <!--del_lnk--> El Fuerte de Samaipata, <!--del_lnk--> Incallajta, and <!--del_lnk--> Iskanawaya. The country abounds in other sites that are difficult to reach and have seen little archaeological exploration.</p>

       <p>The Spanish brought their own tradition of religious art which, in the hands of local native and mestizo builders and <!--del_lnk--> artisans, developed into a rich and distinctive style of architecture, painting, and sculpture known as "Mestizo Baroque". The colonial period produced not only the paintings of P&eacute;rez de Holgu&iacute;n, Flores, Bitti, and others but also the works of skilled but unknown stonecutters, woodcarvers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. An important body of Native Baroque religious music of the colonial period was recovered and has been performed internationally to wide acclaim since 1994.</p>
       <p>Bolivian artists of stature in the 20th century include Guzm&aacute;n de Rojas, Arturo Borda, <!--del_lnk--> Mar&iacute;a Luisa Pacheco, <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Mamani Mamani, <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro Mario Yllanes, <!--del_lnk--> Alfredo Da Silva, and <!--del_lnk--> Marina N&uacute;&ntilde;ez del Prado.</p>
