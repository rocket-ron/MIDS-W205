       <p><b>Bangkok</b> is the <a href="../../wp/c/Capital_city.htm" title="Capital city">capital</a> and the most populous city of <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. It is known in <!--del_lnk--> Thai as <i>Krung Thep Maha Nakhon</i> (<span lang="th" xml:lang="th">&#xE01;&#xE23;&#xE38;&#xE07;&#xE40;&#xE17;&#xE1E;&#xE21;&#xE2B;&#xE32;&#xE19;&#xE04;&#xE23;</span>, pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> [kr&#x16B;&#x14B; t&#x2B0;&ecirc;&#x2D0;p m&aacute;h&#x1CE;&#x2D0; n&aacute;k&#x2B0;&#x254;&#x304;&#x2D0;n]</span>) or simply <i>Krung Thep</i>. The city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres (605.7&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in the <!--del_lnk--> Chao Phraya River delta in Central Thailand, and has a population of over eight million, or 12.6 percent of the country's population. Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) live within the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Bangkok Metropolitan Region, making Bangkok an extreme <!--del_lnk--> primate city, dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in terms of importance.</p>
       <p>Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the <!--del_lnk--> Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century, which eventually grew in size and became the site of two capital cities: Thonburi in 1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of Siam's (as Thailand used to be known) modernization during the later nineteenth century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was the centre stage of Thailand's political struggles throughout the twentieth century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy and underwent numerous coups and uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact among Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Asian investment boom in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a major regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and is emerging as a regional centre for the arts, fashion and entertainment. The city's vibrant street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its notorious <!--del_lnk--> red-light districts, have given it an exotic appeal. The historic <!--del_lnk--> Grand Palace and Buddhist temples including <!--del_lnk--> Wat Arun and <!--del_lnk--> Wat Pho stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of <!--del_lnk--> Khaosan Road and <!--del_lnk--> Patpong. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations. It is ranked third after London and Paris in MasterCard's Global Destination Cities Index, and has been named "World's Best City" for three consecutive years by <i><!--del_lnk--> Travel + Leisure</i> magazine.</p>
       <p>Bangkok's rapid growth amidst little urban planning and regulation has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure systems. Limited roads, despite an extensive <!--del_lnk--> expressway network, together with substantial private car usage, have resulted in chronic and crippling traffic congestion. This in turn caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve this major problem. Four rapid transit lines are now in operation, with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the <!--del_lnk--> Bangkok Metropolitan Administration.</p>

       <p>The area of Bangkok dates at least to the early fifteenth century, when it was a village on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River, under the rule of <!--del_lnk--> Ayutthaya. Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and became the site of <!--del_lnk--> a siege in 1688 in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the <!--del_lnk--> Burmese Kingdom in 1767, the newly declared King <!--del_lnk--> Taksin established his capital at the town, which became the base of the <!--del_lnk--> Thonburi Kingdom. King <!--del_lnk--> Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I), who succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank and founded the <!--del_lnk--> Rattanakosin Kingdom in 1782. The <!--del_lnk--> City Pillar was erected on 21 April, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.</p>
       <p>Bangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid nineteenth century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late nineteenth century. The reigns of Kings <!--del_lnk--> Mongkut (Rama IV, 1851&ndash;68) and <!--del_lnk--> Chulalongkorn (Rama V, 1868&ndash;1910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare. Bangkok became the centre stage for power struggles between the military and political elite as the country abolished absolute monarchy in 1932. It was subject to <!--del_lnk--> Japanese occupation and <!--del_lnk--> Allied bombing during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, but rapidly grew in the post-war period as a result of United States developmental aid and government-sponsored investment. Bangkok's role as an American military <!--del_lnk--> R&amp;R destination launched its tourism industry as well as sex trade. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and unprecedented migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8 to 3 million in the 1960s. Following the United States' withdrawal from Vietnam, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok. Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the <!--del_lnk--> 1997 Asian financial crisis. By then, many public and social issues had emerged, among them the strain on infrastructure reflected in the city's notorious traffic jams. Bangkok's role as the nation's political stage continues to be seen in strings of popular protests, from the student uprisings in <!--del_lnk--> 1973 and <!--del_lnk--> 1976, anti-military demonstrations <!--del_lnk--> in 1992, and successive anti-government protests by the "<!--del_lnk--> Yellow Shirt" and "<!--del_lnk--> Red Shirt" movements from 2008 onwards.</p>
       <p>Administration of the city was first formalized by King Chulalongkorn in 1906, with the establishment of <!--del_lnk--> Monthon Krung Thep Phra Maha Nakhon (<span lang="th" xml:lang="th">&#xE21;&#xE13;&#xE11;&#xE25;&#xE01;&#xE23;&#xE38;&#xE07;&#xE40;&#xE17;&#xE1E;&#xE1E;&#xE23;&#xE30;&#xE21;&#xE2B;&#xE32;&#xE19;&#xE04;&#xE23;</span>) as a national subdivision. In 1915 the <i>monthon</i> was split into several provinces, the administrative boundaries of which have since further changed. The city in its current form was created in 1972 with the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, following the merger of Phra Nakhon Province on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and Thonburi Province on the west during the previous year.</p>

       <p>The etymology of the name <i>Bangkok</i> (<span lang="th" xml:lang="th">&#xE1A;&#xE32;&#xE07;&#xE01;&#xE2D;&#xE01;</span>, pronounced in Thai as <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> [b&#x101;&#x2D0;&#x14B; k&#x254;&#x300;&#x2D0;k]</span>) is unclear. <i>Bang</i> is a Thai word meaning "a village situated on a stream", and the name may have been derived from <i>Bang Ko</i> (<span lang="th" xml:lang="th">&#xE1A;&#xE32;&#xE07;&#xE40;&#xE01;&#xE32;&#xE30;</span>), <i>ko</i> meaning "island", a reference to the area's landscape which was carved by rivers and canals. Another theory speculates that it is shortened from <i>Bang Makok</i> (<span lang="th" xml:lang="th">&#xE1A;&#xE32;&#xE07;&#xE21;&#xE30;&#xE01;&#xE2D;&#xE01;</span>), <i>makok</i> being the name of <i><!--del_lnk--> Spondias pinnata</i>, a plant bearing olive-like fruit. This is supported by the fact that <!--del_lnk--> Wat Arun, a historic temple in the area, used to be named <i>Wat Makok</i>. Officially, however, the town was known as <i>Thonburi Si Mahasamut</i> (<span lang="th" xml:lang="th">&#xE18;&#xE19;&#xE1A;&#xE38;&#xE23;&#xE35;&#xE28;&#xE23;&#xE35;&#xE21;&#xE2B;&#xE32;&#xE2A;&#xE21;&#xE38;&#xE17;&#xE23;</span>, from <!--del_lnk--> Pali and <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, lit. "city of treasures gracing the ocean"), according to Ayutthaya chronicles. <i>Bangkok</i> was likely a colloquial name, albeit one widely adopted by foreign visitors, whose continued use of the name finally resulted in it being officially adopted with the creation of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration.</p>
       <p>When King Rama I established his new capital on the river's eastern bank, he named it <i>Krung Rattanakosin In Ayothaya</i> (<span lang="th" xml:lang="th">&#xE01;&#xE23;&#xE38;&#xE07;&#xE23;&#xE31;&#xE15;&#xE19;&#xE42;&#xE01;&#xE2A;&#xE34;&#xE19;&#xE17;&#xE23;&#xE4C;&#xE2D;&#xE34;&#xE19;&#xE17;&#xE4C;&#xE2D;&#xE42;&#xE22;&#xE18;&#xE22;&#xE32;</span>), and the city and the Siamese kingdom during the period became known as Rattanakosin. Bangkok's current Thai name, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon, is a shortening of its full ceremonial name later given by Kings <!--del_lnk--> Nangklao (Rama III) and Mongkut:</p>

       <p>The name, composed mostly of Pali and Sanskrit root words, translates as:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">City of angels, great city of immortals, magnificent city of the <!--del_lnk--> nine gems, seat of the king, city of royal palaces, home of gods incarnate, erected by <!--del_lnk--> Visvakarman at <!--del_lnk--> Indra's behest.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Thai school children are taught the full name, although few can explain its meaning as many of the words are archaic, and known to few. Most Thais who recall the full name do so because of its use in a popular song, "Krung Thep Maha Nakhon" (1989) (sample) by <!--del_lnk--> Asanee&ndash;Wasan and will often recount it by singing it, much as an English speaker might sing the <!--del_lnk--> alphabet song to recite the alphabet. The entirety of the lyrics is just the name of the city repeated over and over.</p>

       <p>The city of Bangkok is locally governed by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA). Although its boundaries are at the provincial (<i><!--del_lnk--> changwat</i>) level, unlike the other 76 provinces Bangkok is a special administrative area whose governor is directly elected to serve a four-year term. The governor, together with four appointed deputies, form the executive body, who implement policies through the BMA civil service headed by the Permanent Secretary for the BMA. In separate elections, each district elects one or more city councillors, who form the Bangkok Metropolitan Council. The council is the BMA's legislative body, and has power over municipal ordinances and the city's budget. The current Bangkok Governor is M.R. <!--del_lnk--> Sukhumbhand Paribatra of the <!--del_lnk--> Democrat Party, who <!--del_lnk--> was re-elected for his second term in 2013.</p>
       <p>Bangkok is subdivided into <!--del_lnk--> fifty districts (<i>khet</i>, equivalent to <i><!--del_lnk--> amphoe</i> in the other provinces), which are further subdivided into 169 subdistricts (<i>khwaeng</i>, equivalent to <i><!--del_lnk--> tambon</i>). Each district is managed by a district director appointed by the governor. District councils, elected to four-year terms, serve as advisory bodies to their respective district directors.</p>
       <p>The BMA is divided into sixteen departments, each overseeing different aspects of the administration's responsibilities. Most of these responsibilities concern the city's infrastructure, and include city planning, building control, transportation, drainage, waste management and city beautification, as well as education, medical and rescue services. Many of these services are provided jointly with other agencies. The BMA has the authority to implement local ordinances, although civil law enforcement falls under the jurisdiction of the <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Police Bureau.</p>
       <p>The seal of the city shows the god <!--del_lnk--> Indra riding in the clouds on <!--del_lnk--> Airavata, a divine elephant known in Thai as Erawan. In his hand Indra holds his weapon, the <i><!--del_lnk--> vajra</i>. The seal is based on a painting done by <!--del_lnk--> Prince Naris. The tree symbol of Bangkok is <i><!--del_lnk--> Ficus benjamina</i>.</p>
       <p>As the capital of Thailand, Bangkok is the seat of all branches of the <!--del_lnk--> national government. The <!--del_lnk--> Government House, <!--del_lnk--> Parliament House and <!--del_lnk--> Supreme, <!--del_lnk--> Administrative and <!--del_lnk--> Constitutional Courts are all located within the city. Bangkok is the site of the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Palace and <!--del_lnk--> Chitralada Villa, respectively the official and <i>de facto</i> residence of the king. Most government ministries also have headquarters and offices in the capital.</p>

       <p>The Bangkok <!--del_lnk--> city proper covers an area of 1,568.737 square kilometres (605.693&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), ranking 69th among the other 76 provinces of Thailand. Of this, about 700 square kilometres (270&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) form the built-up <!--del_lnk--> urban area. It is ranked 73rd in the world in terms of land area by <!--del_lnk--> City Mayors. The city's <!--del_lnk--> urban sprawl reaches into parts of the six other provinces it borders, namely, in clockwise order from northwest: <!--del_lnk--> Nonthaburi, <!--del_lnk--> Pathum Thani, <!--del_lnk--> Chachoengsao, <!--del_lnk--> Samut Prakan, <!--del_lnk--> Samut Sakhon and <!--del_lnk--> Nakhon Pathom.

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Topography">Topography</span></h3>
       <p>Bangkok is situated in the <!--del_lnk--> Chao Phraya River delta in Thailand's <!--del_lnk--> central plains. The river meanders through the city in a southward direction, emptying into the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Thailand approximately 25 kilometres (16&nbsp;mi) south of the city centre. The area is flat and low-lying, with an average elevation of 1.5 metres (4&nbsp;ft&nbsp;11&nbsp;in) <!--del_lnk--> above sea level. Most of the area was originally <!--del_lnk--> swampland, which was gradually drained and irrigated for agriculture via the construction of canals (<i><!--del_lnk--> khlong</i>) which took place throughout the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. The course of the river as it flows through Bangkok has been modified by the construction of <!--del_lnk--> several shortcut canals.</p>
       <div class="thumb tleft">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:172px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/1663/166361.jpg.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="271" src="../../images/1663/166361.jpg"  width="170" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>This intricate waterway network served as the primary mode of transport up until the late nineteenth century, when modern roads began to be built. Up until then, most people lived near or on the water, leading the city to be known during the nineteenth century as the "<!--del_lnk--> Venice of the East". Many of these canals have since been filled in or paved over, but others still criss-cross the city, serving as major drainage channels and transport routes. Most canals are now badly polluted, although the BMA has committed to the treatment and cleaning up of several canals.</p>
       <p>The geology of the Bangkok area is characterized by a top layer of soft <!--del_lnk--> marine clay known as Bangkok clay, averaging 15 metres (49&nbsp;ft) in thickness, which overlies an <!--del_lnk--> aquifer system consisting of eight known units. This feature has contributed to the effects of <!--del_lnk--> subsidence caused by extensive ground water pumping. First recognized in the 1970s, subsidence soon became a critical issue, reaching a rate of 120 millimetres (4.7&nbsp;in) per year in 1981. Ground water management and mitigation measures have since lessened the severity of the situation, although subsidence is still occurring at a rate of 10 to 30 millimetres (0.39 to 1.2 in) per year, and parts of the city are now 1 metre (3&nbsp;ft&nbsp;3&nbsp;in) below sea level. There are fears that the city may be submerged by 2030. Subsidence has resulted in increased flood risk, as Bangkok is already prone to flooding due to its low altitude and inadequate drainage infrastructure resulting from rapid urbanization. The city now relies on flood barriers and augmenting drainage from canals by pumping and building drain tunnels, but parts of Bangkok and its suburbs are still regularly affected by flooding. Heavy downpours resulting in <!--del_lnk--> urban runoff overwhelming drainage systems, and runoff discharge from upstream areas, are major triggering factors. Severe flooding affecting much of the city occurred recently in 1995 and <!--del_lnk--> 2011. In the latter, most of Bangkok's northern, eastern and western districts became inundated, in some places for over two months. Coastal erosion is also an issue in the gulf coastal area, a small length of which lies within Bangkok's Bang Khun Thian District. <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">Global warming</a> poses further serious risks, and a study by the <!--del_lnk--> OECD has estimated that 5.138 million people in Bangkok may be exposed to coastal flooding by 2070, the seventh highest among the world's port cities.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
       <p>Like most of Thailand, Bangkok has a <!--del_lnk--> tropical wet and dry climate under the <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;ppen climate classification and is under the influence of the <!--del_lnk--> South Asian monsoon system. It experiences hot, rainy and cool seasons, although temperatures are fairly hot year-round, ranging from an average low of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">20.8 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(69.4&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> in December to an average high of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">34.9 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(94.8&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> in April. The rainy season begins with the arrival of the southwest monsoon around mid-May. September is the wettest month, with an average rain fall of 344.2 millimetres (13.55&nbsp;in). The rainy season lasts until October, when the dry and cool northeast monsoon takes over until February. The hot season is generally dry, but also sees occasional summer storms. The surface magnitude of Bangkok's <!--del_lnk--> urban heat island has been measured at <span style="white-space:nowrap;">2.5 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(4.5&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> during the day and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">8.0 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(14&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> at night. The highest recorded temperature in Bangkok is <span style="white-space:nowrap;">40.8 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(105.4&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> in May 1983, and the lowest recorded temperature is <span style="white-space:nowrap;">9.9 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(49.8&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> in January 1955.</p>

       <p>Bangkok's district areas often do not accurately represent the functional divisions of its neighbourhoods or actual land uses. Although <!--del_lnk--> urban planning policies date to the commission of the "Litchfield plan" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, actual zoning regulations were not implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as <!--del_lnk--> ribbon developments extended along newly built roads, and vertically with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in several commercial areas. The city has grown from its original centre along the river to a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly-populated and growing cities of <!--del_lnk--> Nonthaburi, <!--del_lnk--> Pak Kret, <!--del_lnk--> Rangsit and <!--del_lnk--> Samut Prakan are effectively suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper in its eastern and western fringes. Land use in the city consists of 23 percent residential use, 24 percent agriculture, and 30 percent used for commerce, industry and by the government. The BMA's City Planning Department is responsible for planning and shaping further development. It has published master plan updates in 1999 and 2006, and a third revision is undergoing public hearings in 2012.</p>
       <p>Bangkok's historic centre is the <!--del_lnk--> Rattanakosin Island in Phra Nakhon District. It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary landmarks of the city's foundation, as well as many important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the later nineteenth century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are located here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early nineteenth century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new <!--del_lnk--> Dusit Palace. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical <!--del_lnk--> Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Plaza and <!--del_lnk--> Ratchadamnoen Avenue which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the <!--del_lnk--> Democracy Monument. The area is the site of the country's seats of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.</p>
       <div class="thumb tleft">
       </div>
       <p>In contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on <!--del_lnk--> Si Lom and <!--del_lnk--> Sathon Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's infamous <!--del_lnk--> red-light districts. The <!--del_lnk--> Siam and <!--del_lnk--> Ratchaprasong areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in Southeast Asia. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along <!--del_lnk--> Sukhumvit Road leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially <!--del_lnk--> Asok Montri, while upmarket housing span many of its <!--del_lnk--> <i>soi</i>s.</p>
       <p>Although Bangkok does not have a clear geographical centre, "downtown" is generally considered to be at or near <!--del_lnk--> Siam Square, which contains many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Siam Station, the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines. The <!--del_lnk--> Victory Monument in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over a hundred bus lines as well as an elevated train station. From the monument, <!--del_lnk--> Phahonyothin and <!--del_lnk--> Ratchawithi&nbsp;/ Din Daeng Roads respectively run northward and eastward linking to major residential areas. Most high-density development is located within the 113-square-kilometre (44&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) area encircled by the <!--del_lnk--> Ratchadaphisek inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also concentrate around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with few high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, as well as the outlying eastern districts, consist mostly of residential and rural areas.</p>
       <p>While most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular <!--del_lnk--> shophouses, the largely unrestricted building frenzy of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban jungle of skyscrapers and high rises exhibiting contrasting and clashing styles. There are 117 skyscrapers over 100 metres (330&nbsp;ft) tall in the city, with 37 under construction as of 2012. Bangkok was ranked as the world's twenty-third-tallest city in 2011. On the other hand, as a result of economic disparity, many slums have emerged in the city. In 2000 there were over a million people living in about eight hundred slum settlements. A large number of slums are concentrated near the Bangkok Port in Khlong Toei District.</p>

       <p>Bangkok has several parks, although these amount to a per-capita total park area of only 1.82 square metres (19.6&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft) in the city proper. Total green space for the entire city is moderate, at 11.8 square metres (127&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft) per person; however, in the more densely built-up areas of the city these numbers are as low as 1.73 and 0.72 square metres (18.6 and 7.8 sq&nbsp;ft) per person. <!--del_lnk--> Green belt areas include about 700 square kilometres (270&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of rice paddies and orchards in the eastern and western edges of the city proper, although their primary purpose is to serve as flood <!--del_lnk--> detention basins rather than to limit urban expansion. <!--del_lnk--> Bang Kachao, a 20-square-kilometre (7.7&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) conservation area in an oxbow of the Chao Phraya, lies just across the southern riverbank districts, in Samut Prakan Province. A master development plan has been proposed to increase total park area to 4 square metres (43&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft) per person.</p>
       <p>Bangkok's largest parks include the centrally located <!--del_lnk--> Lumphini Park near the Si Lom &ndash; Sathon business district with an area of 57.6 hectares (142&nbsp;acres), the 80-hectare (200-acre) <!--del_lnk--> Suanluang Rama IX in the east of the city, and the <!--del_lnk--> Chatuchak&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> Queen Sirikit&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> Wachirabenchathat park complex in northern Bangkok, which has a combined area of 92 hectares (230&nbsp;acres).</p>

       <p>The city of Bangkok has a population of 8,280,925 according to the 2010 census, or 12.6 percent of the national population. However, there are only 5,701,394 registered residents, belonging to 2,400,540 households. A large number of Bangkok's daytime population commutes from surrounding provinces in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, the total population of which is 14,565,547. Bangkok is a cosmopolitan city; the census showed that it is home to 81,570 Japanese and 55,893 Chinese nationals, as well as 117,071 expatriates from other Asian countries, 48,341 from Europe, 23,418 from the Americas, 5,289 from Australia and 3,022 from Africa. Immigrants from neighbouring countries include 303,595 Burmese, 63,438 Cambodians and 18,126 Lao.</p>
       <p>Although it has been Thailand's largest population centre since its establishment as capital city in 1782, Bangkok grew only slightly throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. British diplomat <!--del_lnk--> John Crawfurd, visiting in 1822, estimated its population at no more than 50,000. As a result of Western medicine brought by missionaries as well as increased immigration from both within Siam and overseas, Bangkok's population gradually increased as the city modernized in the late nineteenth century. This growth became even more pronounced in the 1930s, following the discovery of antibiotics. Although family planning and birth control was introduced in the 1960s, the lowered birth rate was more than offset by increased migration from the provinces as economic expansion accelerated. Only in the 1990s have Bangkok's population growth rates decreased, following the national rate. Thailand had long since become highly centralized around the capital. In 1980, Bangkok's population was fifty-one times that of <!--del_lnk--> Hat Yai and <!--del_lnk--> Songkhla, the second-largest urban centre, making it the world's most prominent <!--del_lnk--> primate city.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The majority of Bangkok's population are of <!--del_lnk--> Thai ethnicity, although details on the city's ethnic make-up are unavailable, as the national census does not document race. Bangkok's cultural pluralism dates back to the early days of its foundation; several ethnic communities were formed by immigrants and forced settlers including the Khmer, Northern Thai, Lao, Vietnamese, Tavoyan, Mon and Malay. Most prominent were the Chinese, who played major roles in the city's trade and became the majority of Bangkok's population&mdash;estimates include up to three-fourths in 1828 and almost half in the 1950s. However, Chinese immigration was restricted from the 1930s and effectively ceased after the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Revolution in 1949. Their prominence subsequently declined as younger generations of <!--del_lnk--> Thai Chinese have increasingly integrated and adopted a Thai identity. Bangkok is still nevertheless home to a large Chinese community, with the greatest concentration in <!--del_lnk--> Yaowarat, Bangkok's Chinatown. The majority (91 percent) of the city's population is Buddhist. Other religions include Islam (4.7%), Christianity (2.0%), Hinduism (0.5%), Sikhism (0.1%) and Confucianism (0.1%).</p>
       <p>Apart from Yaowarat, Bangkok also has several other distinct ethnic neighbourhoods. The Indian community is centred in <!--del_lnk--> Phahurat, where the Gurdwara Siri Guru Singh Sabha, founded in 1933, is located. <!--del_lnk--> Ban Khrua on Saen Saep Canal is home to descendants of the <!--del_lnk--> Cham who settled in the late eighteenth century. Although the Portuguese who settled during the Thonburi period have ceased to exist as a distinct community, their past is reflected in Santa Kruz Church, on the west bank of the river. Likewise, the <!--del_lnk--> Assumption Cathedral on Charoen Krung Road is among many European-style buildings in the Old <!--del_lnk--> Farang Quarter, where European diplomats and merchants lived during the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. Nearby, the Haroon Mosque is the centre of a Muslim community. Newer expatriate communities exist along Sukhumvit Road, including the Japanese community near Soi Phrom Phong, and the Arab and North African neighbourhood along Soi Nana. Sukhumvit Plaza, a mall on Soi Sukhumvit 12, is popularly known as Korea Town.</p>

       <p>Bangkok is the <!--del_lnk--> economic centre of Thailand, and the heart of the country's investment and development. In 2010, the city had an economic output of 3.142 trillion <!--del_lnk--> baht (approx. US$98.34bn), contributing 29.1 percent of the <a href="../../wp/g/Gross_domestic_product.htm" title="Gross domestic product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP). This amounted to a per-capita GDP value of &#xE3F;456,911 ($14,301), almost three times the national average of &#xE3F;160,556 ($5,025). The Bangkok Metropolitan Region had a combined output of &#xE3F;4,773bn ($149.39bn), or 44.2 percent of GDP. Bangkok's economy ranks as the sixth among Asian cities in terms of per-capita GDP, after Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Osaka&ndash;Kobe and Seoul.</p>
       <p>Wholesale and retail trade is the largest sector in the city's economy, contributing 24.0 percent of Bangkok's gross provincial product. It is followed by manufacturing (14.3%); real estate, renting and business activities (12.4%); transport and communications (11.6%); and financial intermediation (11.1%). Bangkok alone accounts for 48.4 percent of Thailand's service sector, which in turn constitutes 49.0 percent of GDP. When the Bangkok Metropolitan Region is considered, manufacturing is the most significant contributor at 28.2 percent of the gross regional product, reflecting the density of industry in the Bangkok's neighbouring provinces. <!--del_lnk--> The automotive industry based around Greater Bangkok is the largest production hub in Southeast Asia. Tourism is also a significant contributor to Bangkok's economy, generating &#xE3F;427.5bn ($13.38bn) in revenue in 2010.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is located on Ratchadaphisek Road in inner Bangkok. The SET, together with the Market for Alternative Investment (mai) has 648 listed companies as of the end of 2011, with a combined market capitalization of 8.485 trillion baht ($267.64bn). Due to the large amount of foreign representation, Thailand has for several years been a mainstay of the Southeast Asian economy and a key centre in Asian business. The <!--del_lnk--> Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranks Bangkok as an "Alpha&minus;" <!--del_lnk--> world city, and it is ranked 59th in Z/Yen's <i><!--del_lnk--> Global Financial Centres Index 11</i>.</p>
       <p>Bangkok is home to the headquarters of all of Thailand's major commercial banks and financial institutions, as well as the country's largest companies. A large number of multinational corporations base their regional headquarters in Bangkok due to the lower cost of the workforce and firm operations relative to other major Asian business centres. Seventeen Thai companies are listed on the <!--del_lnk--> Forbes 2000, all of which are based in the capital, including <!--del_lnk--> PTT, the only <!--del_lnk--> Fortune Global 500 company in Thailand.</p>
       <p>Income inequality is a major issue in Bangkok, especially between relatively unskilled lower-income immigrants from rural provinces and neighbouring countries, and middle-class professionals and business elites. Although absolute poverty rates are low&mdash;only 0.64 percent of Bangkok's registered residents were living under the poverty line in 2010, compared to a national average of 7.75&mdash;economic disparity is still substantial. The city has a <!--del_lnk--> Gini coefficient of 0.48, indicating a high level of inequality.</p>

       <p>Bangkok is one of the world's top tourist destination cities. It is ranked third in international visitors in MasterCard's Global Destination Cities Index, after London and Paris, with 12.2 million visitors projected to arrive in 2012. It also ranks third in international visitor spending, with 19.3 billion dollars projected for 2012, after London and New York. <!--del_lnk--> Euromonitor International ranked Bangkok fifth in its Top City Destinations Ranking for 2010. Bangkok has also been named "World's Best City" by <i><!--del_lnk--> Travel + Leisure</i> magazine's survey of its readers for three consecutive years since 2010.</p>
       <p>As the main gateway through which visitors arrive in Thailand, Bangkok is visited by the majority of international tourists to the country. Domestic tourism is also prominent. The Department of Tourism recorded 26,861,095 Thai and 11,361,808 foreign visitors to Bangkok in 2010. Lodgings were made by 15,031,244 guests, who occupied 49.9 percent of the city's 86,687 hotel rooms.</p>
       <p>Bangkok's multi-faceted sights, attractions and city life appeal to diverse groups of tourists. Royal palaces and temples as well as several museums constitute its major historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. The city is also famous for its dynamic nightlife. Although Bangkok's <!--del_lnk--> sex tourism scene is well known to foreigners, it is usually not openly acknowledged by locals or the government.</p>

The <!--del_lnk--> Giant Swing and <!--del_lnk--> Erawan Shrine demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture. <!--del_lnk--> Vimanmek Mansion in Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the <!--del_lnk--> Jim Thompson House provides an example of traditional <!--del_lnk--> Thai architecture. Other major museums include the <!--del_lnk--> Bangkok National Museum and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Barge National Museum. Cruises and boat trips on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals offer views of some of the city's traditional architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.</p>
       <p>Shopping venues, many of which are popular with both tourists and locals, range from the shopping centres and department stores concentrated in Siam and Ratchaprasong to the sprawling <!--del_lnk--> Chatuchak Weekend Market. <!--del_lnk--> Taling Chan Floating Market is among the few such markets in Bangkok. Yaowarat is known for its shops as well as street-side food stalls and restaurants, which are also found throughout the city. <!--del_lnk--> Khao San Road has long been famous as a <!--del_lnk--> backpackers' destination, with its budget accommodation, shops and bars attracting visitors of all languages and races.</p>
       <p>Bangkok has a reputation overseas as a major destination in the sex industry. Although <!--del_lnk--> prostitution is technically illegal and is rarely openly discussed in Thailand, it commonly takes place among massage parlours, saunas and hourly hotels, serving foreign tourists as well as locals. Bangkok has acquired the nickname "Sin City of Asia" for its level of sex tourism.</p>
       <p>Issues often encountered by foreign tourists include scams, overcharging and dual pricing. In a survey of 616 tourists visiting Thailand, 7.79 percent reported encountering a scam, the most common of which was the <!--del_lnk--> gem scam, in which tourists are tricked into buying overpriced jewellery.</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Culture">Culture</span></h2>
       <p>The culture of Bangkok reflects its position as Thailand's centre of wealth and modernization. The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. <!--del_lnk--> Conspicuous consumption serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts. Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.</p>
       <p>A distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of <!--del_lnk--> street vendors selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorized the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.</p>

Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Guards' parade.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Sanam Luang is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Ploughing Ceremony which takes place in May.

       <p>Modern Bangkok has developed a strong spectator sport culture. While <!--del_lnk--> muay Thai kickboxing matches at <!--del_lnk--> Rajadamnern and <!--del_lnk--> Lumpini Stadiums are regularly broadcast on television, the sport has mostly been overtaken in popularity by <a href="../../wp/a/Association_football.htm" title="Association football">association football</a>. Several foreign leagues and competitions, especially England's <a href="../../wp/p/Premier_League.htm" title="Premier League">Premier League</a>, have large followings in Bangkok as well as other Thai urban centres. In recent years, the <!--del_lnk--> Thai Premier League has been gaining popularity. <!--del_lnk--> Muangthong United and <!--del_lnk--> BEC&ndash;Tero Sasana are leading clubs based in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region.</p>
       <p>While <!--del_lnk--> sepak takraw can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, especially by the working class, football and other modern sports are now more of the norm. Western sports were introduced during the reign of King Chulalongkorn, and were originally only available to the privileged. Such status is still associated with certain sports. Golf is popular among the upwardly mobile, and while Thailand's more famous clubs are in the countryside, there are several courses in Bangkok itself. Horse riding and racing take place in a couple of exclusive clubs in the city.</p>
       <p>There are many public <!--del_lnk--> sporting facilities located throughout Bangkok. The two main centres are the <!--del_lnk--> National Stadium complex, which dates to 1938, and the newer <!--del_lnk--> Hua Mak Sports Complex, which was built for the <!--del_lnk--> 1998 Asian Games. Bangkok had also hosted the games in <!--del_lnk--> 1966, <!--del_lnk--> 1970 and <!--del_lnk--> 1978. The city was the host of the first <!--del_lnk--> SEA Games in 1959 and the <!--del_lnk--> Summer Universiade in 2007. Thailand is the host of the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 FIFA Futsal World Cup and Bangkok is one of the host cities along with <!--del_lnk--> Nakhon Ratchasima.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Although Bangkok's canals historically served as a major mode of transport, they have long since been surpassed in importance by land traffic. <!--del_lnk--> Charoen Krung Road, the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated <!--del_lnk--> expressway network helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and electric trams served the city from 1894 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first <!--del_lnk--> rapid transit system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and <!--del_lnk--> boat services which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and <i><!--del_lnk--> tuk-tuk</i> auto rickshaws.</p>
       <p>Bangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the <!--del_lnk--> national highway and <!--del_lnk--> rail networks, as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.</p>
       <p>The BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Roads">Roads</span></h3>
       <p>Road-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (<i>soi</i>) which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while the Ratchadaphisek inner ring road encircles the inner city. Several roads linking Bangkok with neighbouring and further provinces are designated as national highways, including the primary routes Phahonyothin (route 1), Sukhumvit (route 3), and <!--del_lnk--> Phetkasem (route 4). The outer ring road, Kanchanaphisek (<!--del_lnk--> motorway route 9), runs through Bangkok's suburbs, linking with Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani and Samut Prakan, while the Bangkok&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> Chonburi Motorway (route 7) runs to the <!--del_lnk--> eastern seaboard province, passing Suvarnabhumi Airport on the way.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Bangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued&mdash;in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles. These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, were expressed as severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s. The extent of the problem is such that the Thai Traffic Police has a unit of officers trained in basic midwifery in order to assist deliveries which do not reach hospital in time. While Bangkok's limited road surface area (8 percent, compared to 20&ndash;30 percent in most Western cities) is often cited as a major cause of its traffic jams, other factors, including high vehicle ownership rate relative to income level, inadequate public transport systems, and lack of <!--del_lnk--> transportation demand management, also play a role. Efforts to alleviate the problem have included the construction of intersection bypasses and an extensive system of elevated highways (including the expressway system and <!--del_lnk--> Don Mueang Tollway), as well as the creation of several new rapid transit systems. These actions, however, have yet to prove successful in improving the city's overall traffic conditions.</p>
       <p>Traffic has been the main source of air pollution in Bangkok, which reached serious levels in the 1990s. However, efforts to improve air quality by improving fuel quality and enforcing emission standards, among others, have been largely successful. <!--del_lnk--> Atmospheric particulate matter levels dropped from 81 micrograms per cubic metre in 1997 to 43 in 2007.</p>
       <p>Although the BMA has created thirty signed bicycle routes along several roads totalling 230 kilometres (140&nbsp;mi), cycling is still largely impractical, especially in the city centre. Most of these bicycle lanes share the pavement with pedestrians. Poor surface maintenance, encroachment by hawkers and street vendors, and a hostile environment for cyclists and pedestrians, make cycling and walking unpopular methods of getting around in Bangkok.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Buses"><span id="Bus_services"></span>Buses</span></h3>
       <p>Bangkok has an extensive bus network providing local transit services within the Greater Bangkok area. The <!--del_lnk--> Bangkok Mass Transit Authority (BMTA) operates a monopoly on bus services, with substantial concessions granted to private operators. 3,506 BMTA buses, together with private joint buses, minibuses, <i><!--del_lnk--> song thaeo</i> buses and vans totalling 16,321 in number, operate on 470 routes throughout the region. Although a large number of commuters still ride the buses daily, passenger numbers have been almost consistently on decline in the last two decades. The BMTA reported an average of 1,048,442 trips per day in 2010, a quarter of the 4,073,883 reported in 1992.</p>
       <p>A separate <!--del_lnk--> bus rapid transit system owned by the BMA has been in operation since 2010. Known simply as the <!--del_lnk--> BRT, the system currently consists of a single line running from the business district at Sathon to Ratchaphruek on the western side of the city. Although further lines had been planned, development on all route expansions are currently halted.</p>
       <p>Long-distance bus services to all provinces operate out of Bangkok. <!--del_lnk--> The Transport Co., Ltd. is the BMTA's long-distance counterpart. North- and northeast-bound buses leave from the Chatuchak (Mo Chit 2) Bus Terminal, while eastbound and southbound buses leave from Ekkamai and South Bangkok terminals, respectively.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Taxis are ubiquitous in Bangkok, and are a popular form of transport. As of August 2012, there are 106,050 cars, 58,276 motorcycles and 8,996 <i>tuk-tuk</i> motorized tricycles cumulatively registered for use as taxis. Meters have been required for car taxis since 1992, while <i>tuk-tuk</i>s' fares are usually bargained. <!--del_lnk--> Motorcycle taxis operate from regulated ranks, with either fixed or negotiable fares, and are usually employed for relatively short journeys.</p>
       <p>Car taxis are either privately owned, or belong to a company or cooperative. Such ownership is reflected in their bright and distinctive paints: private taxis are green/yellow, while different companies have varying colour schemes. Despite their popularity, taxis have gained a bad reputation for often refusing passengers when the requested route is not to the driver's convenience. In June 2012, the Department of Land Transport announced a campaign to overhaul taxi driver registrations, as it revealed that there had been only 66,645 legally registered cabdrivers. A campaign of stricter punishments for refusing passengers was announced in September, along with the launch of new complaint-lodging systems.</p>
       <p>Motorcycle taxis were previously unregulated, and subject to extortion by organized crime gangs. Since 2003, registration has been required for motorcycle taxi ranks, and drivers now wear distinctive numbered vests designating their district of registration and where they are allowed to accept passengers.</p>

       <p>Bangkok is the location of <!--del_lnk--> Hua Lamphong Railway Station, the main terminus of the national rail network operated by the <!--del_lnk--> State Railway of Thailand (SRT). In addition to long-distance services, the SRT also operates a few daily commuter trains running from and to the outskirts of the city during the rush hour, but passenger numbers have remained low.</p>
       <p>Bangkok is currently served by three rapid transit systems: the <!--del_lnk--> BTS Skytrain, the underground <!--del_lnk--> MRT and the elevated <!--del_lnk--> Airport Rail Link. Although proposals for the development of rapid transit in Bangkok had been made since 1975, it was only in 1999 that the BTS finally began operation.</p>
       <p>The BTS consists of two lines, <!--del_lnk--> Sukhumvit and <!--del_lnk--> Silom, with thirty stations along 30.95 kilometres (19.23&nbsp;mi). The MRT opened for use in July 2004, and currently consists of one line, the <!--del_lnk--> Blue Line. It runs for 20 kilometres (12&nbsp;mi) and has eighteen stations, three of which connect to the BTS system. The Airport Rail Link, more recently opened in August 2010, is operated by the SRT and connects the city centre to Suvarnabhumi Airport to the east. Its eight stations span a distance of 28 kilometres (17&nbsp;mi).</p>
       <p>Although initial passenger numbers were low and their service area remains limited to the inner city, these systems have become indispensable to many commuters. The BTS reported an average of 392,167 daily trips in 2010, while the MRT had 178,334 passenger trips per day. However, relatively high fare prices have kept these systems inaccessible to a portion of the population.</p>
       <p>The BTS has had two route extensions since its opening. As of 2012, construction work is being done to extend the southwest and southeast ends of the BTS, as well as double the length of the Blue MRT line. Several additional transit lines are also under construction, including the northward <!--del_lnk--> Purple Line and the <!--del_lnk--> Light Red grade-separated commuter rail line, to be run by the SRT. The entire <!--del_lnk--> Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region consists of eight main lines and four feeder lines totalling 508 kilometres (316&nbsp;mi) to be completed by 2029. In addition to rapid transit and heavy rail lines, there have been proposals for several monorail systems.</p>

       <p>Although much diminished from their past prominence, water-based transport still plays an important role in Bangkok and the immediate upstream and downstream provinces. Several <!--del_lnk--> water buses serve commuters daily. The <!--del_lnk--> Chao Phraya Express Boat carries passengers along the river, regularly serving thirty-four stops from Rat Burana to Nonthaburi and carrying an average of 35,586 passengers per day in 2010. The smaller <!--del_lnk--> Khlong Saen Saep boat service serves twenty-seven stops from Wat Si Bun Rueang to Phan Fa Lilat on <!--del_lnk--> Saen Saep Canal, and another service serves thirteen stops on Khlong Phra Khanong. They served a daily average of 57,557 and 721 passengers, respectively. <!--del_lnk--> Long-tail boats operate on fifteen regular routes on the Chao Phraya, with an average of 2,889 passengers per day. Passenger ferries at thirty-two river crossings served an average of 136,927 daily passengers in 2010.</p>
       <p>Bangkok Port, popularly known by its location as <!--del_lnk--> Khlong Toei Port, was Thailand's main international port from its opening in 1947 until it was superseded by the deep-sea <!--del_lnk--> Laem Chabang Port in 1991. It is primarily a cargo port, though its inland location limits access to ships of 12,000 deadweight tonnes or less. The port handled 11,936,855 tonnes (13,158,130 tons) of cargo in the first eight months of the 2010 fiscal year, about 22 percent the total of the country's international ports.</p>

       <p>Bangkok is one of Asia's busiest <!--del_lnk--> air transport hubs. Two commercial airports serve the city, the older <!--del_lnk--> Don Mueang International Airport and the new Bangkok International Airport, commonly known as <!--del_lnk--> Suvarnabhumi. Suvarnabhumi, which replaced Don Mueang as Bangkok's main airport at its opening in 2006, served 47,910,744 passengers in 2011, making it the world's sixteenth-busiest airport by passenger volume and the fifth-busiest in the Asia Pacific region. However, this amount of traffic is already over its designed capacity of 45 million passengers. Don Mueang has since been reopened for domestic flights in 2007, and resumed international services focusing on low-cost carriers in October 2012. Suvarnabhumi is undergoing expansion in order to increase its capacity to 60 million, which is expected to be completed by 2016.</p>

       <p>Bangkok has, from the beginning, been the centre of modern education in Thailand. The first schools in the country were established in here in the later nineteenth century. The city is home to the country's five oldest universities, <!--del_lnk--> Chulalongkorn, <!--del_lnk--> Thammasat, <!--del_lnk--> Kasetsart, <!--del_lnk--> Mahidol and <!--del_lnk--> Silpakorn, founded between 1917 and 1943. The city has since continued its dominance, especially in higher education; the majority of the country's universities, both public and private, <!--del_lnk--> are located in Bangkok or the Metropolitan Region. Chulalongkorn and Mahidol are the only Thai universities to have appeared in the top five hundred of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Times Higher Education</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> QS</i> World University Rankings.</p>
       <p>Over the past few decades the general trend of pursuing a university degree has prompted the founding of new universities to meet the needs of the Thai students. Bangkok became not only a place where immigrants and provincial Thais go for job opportunities, but also for a chance to receive a university degree. <!--del_lnk--> Ramkhamhaeng University emerged in 1971 as Thailand's first open university; it now has the highest enrolment in the country. The demand for higher education has led to the founding of many other universities and colleges, both public and private. While many universities have been established in major provinces, the Greater Bangkok region remains home to the greater majority of institutions, and the city's tertiary education scene remains over-populated with non-Bangkokians. The situation is not limited to higher education, either. In the 1960s, 60 to 70 percent of ten-to-nineteen-year-olds who were in school had migrated to Bangkok for secondary education. This was due to both a lack of secondary schools in the provinces and perceived higher standards of education in the capital. Although this discrepancy has since largely abated, tens of thousands of students still compete for places in Bangkok's leading schools. Education has long been a prime factor in the centralization of Bangkok and will play a vital role in the government's efforts to decentralize the country.</p>

       <p>Much of Thailand's medical resources are disproportionately concentrated in the capital. In 2000, Bangkok had 39.6 percent of the country's doctors and a physician-to-population ratio of 1:794, compared to a median of 1:5,667 among all provinces. The city is <!--del_lnk--> home to 42 public hospitals, 5 of which are university hospitals, as well as 98 private hospitals and 4,063 registered clinics. The BMA operates nine public hospitals through its Medical Service Department, and its Health Department provides primary care through sixty-eight community health centres. Thailand's universal <!--del_lnk--> healthcare system is implemented through public hospitals and health centres as well as participating private providers.</p>
       <p>Research-oriented medical school affiliates such as <!--del_lnk--> Siriraj, <!--del_lnk--> King Chulalongkorn Memorial and <!--del_lnk--> Ramathibodi Hospitals are among the largest in the country, and act as <!--del_lnk--> tertiary care centres, receiving referrals from distant parts of the country. Lately, especially in the private sector, there has been much growth in <!--del_lnk--> medical tourism, with hospitals such as <!--del_lnk--> Bumrungrad and <!--del_lnk--> Bangkok Hospital, among others, providing services specifically catering to foreigners. An estimated 200,000 medical tourists visited Thailand in 2011, making Bangkok the most popular global destination for medical tourism.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Crime_and_safety">Crime and safety</span></h2>
       <p>Bangkok has a relatively moderate crime rate when compared to urban counterparts around the world. Traffic accidents are a major hazard, while natural disasters are rare. Intermittent episodes of political unrest have resulted in losses of life.</p>
       <p>Although the crime threat in Bangkok is relatively low, non-confrontational crimes of opportunity such as pick-pocketing, purse-snatching, and credit card fraud occur with frequency. Bangkok's growth since the 1960s has been followed by increasing crime rates partly driven by urbanization, migration, unemployment and poverty. By the late 1980s, Bangkok's crime rates were about four times that of the rest of the country. The police have long been preoccupied with street crimes ranging from housebreaking to assault and murder. The 1990s saw the emergence of vehicle theft and organized crime, particularly by foreign gangs. Drug trafficking, especially that of <i><!--del_lnk--> ya ba</i> methamphetamine pills, is also chronic.</p>
       <p>According to police statistics, the most common complaint received by the Metropolitan Police Bureau in 2010 was housebreaking, with 12,347 cases. This was followed by 5,504 cases of motorcycle thefts, 3,694 cases of assault, and 2,836 cases of embezzlement. Serious offences included 183 murders, 81 gang robberies, 265 robberies, 1 kidnapping and 9 arson cases. Offences against the state were by far more common, and included 54,068 drug-related cases, 17,239 cases involving prostitution and 8,634 related to gambling. The Thailand Crime Victim Survey conducted by the Office of Justice Affairs of the Ministry of Justice found that 2.7 percent of surveyed households reported a member being victim of a crime in 2007. Of these, 96.1 percent were crimes against property, 2.6 percent were crimes against life and body, and 1.4 percent were information-related crimes.</p>
       <p>Political demonstrations and protests are common in Bangkok. While most events since 1992 had been peaceful, the series of protests alternately staged by the Yellow Shirts and Red Shirts since 2006 have often turned violent. Red Shirt demonstrations during March&ndash;May 2010 ended in a <!--del_lnk--> crackdown in which 92 were killed, including armed and unarmed protesters, security forces, civilians and journalists. Terrorist incidents have also occurred in Bangkok, most notably a <!--del_lnk--> series of bombings on the 2006&ndash;07 New Year's Eve.</p>
       <p>Traffic accidents are a major hazard in Bangkok. There were 37,985 accidents in the city in 2010, resulting in 16,602 injuries and 456 deaths as well as 426.42 million baht in damages. However, the rate of fatal accidents is much lower than in the rest of Thailand. While accidents in Bangkok amounted to 50.9 percent of the entire country, only 6.2 percent of fatalities occurred in the city. Another serious public health hazard comes from <!--del_lnk--> Bangkok's stray dogs. Up to 300,000 strays are estimated to roam the city's streets, and dog bites are among the most common injuries treated in the emergency departments of the city's hospitals. Rabies is prevalent among the dog population, and treatment for bites pose a heavy public burden. Natural disasters, on the other hand, are rare. While the severe floods of 2011 adversely affected Bangkok, no deaths were reported in city itself.
