       <p><b>Blood</b> is a specialized <!--del_lnk--> bodily fluid (technically a <!--del_lnk--> tissue).</p>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/v/Vertebrate.htm" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a> it is composed of <!--del_lnk--> blood cells suspended in a liquid called <!--del_lnk--> blood plasma. Plasma, which comprises 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (90% by volume), and contains dissolved proteins, <a href="../../wp/g/Glucose.htm" title="Glucose">glucose</a>, mineral ions, <a href="../../wp/h/Hormone.htm" title="Hormone">hormones</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), <!--del_lnk--> platelets and blood cells themselves. The blood cells present in blood are mainly <!--del_lnk--> red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes) and <!--del_lnk--> white blood cells, including leukocytes and <!--del_lnk--> platelets (also called thrombocytes).</p>
       <p>The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain <!--del_lnk--> hemoglobin, an <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>-containing protein, which facilitates transportation of <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> by reversibly binding to this <!--del_lnk--> respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly dissolved in plasma as <!--del_lnk--> bicarbonate ion.</p>
       <p>Vertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated. Some animals, such as <a href="../../wp/c/Crustacean.htm" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a> and <!--del_lnk--> mollusks, use <!--del_lnk--> hemocyanin to carry oxygen, instead of hemoglobin. <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">Insects</a> and some molluscs use a fluid called <!--del_lnk--> hemolymph instead of blood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed <!--del_lnk--> circulatory system. In most insects, this "blood" does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough that their <!--del_lnk--> tracheal system suffices for supplying oxygen.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Jawed vertebrates have an <!--del_lnk--> adaptive immune system, based largely on <!--del_lnk--> white blood cells. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. <!--del_lnk--> Platelets are important in the <!--del_lnk--> clotting of blood. <a href="../../wp/a/Arthropod.htm" title="Arthropod">Arthropods</a>, using hemolymph, have <!--del_lnk--> hemocytes as part of their <a href="../../wp/i/Immune_system.htm" title="Immune system">immune system</a>.</p>
       <p>Blood is circulated around the body through <!--del_lnk--> blood vessels by the pumping action of the <a href="../../wp/h/Heart.htm" title="Heart">heart</a>. In animals having <!--del_lnk--> lungs, <!--del_lnk--> arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and <!--del_lnk--> venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of <!--del_lnk--> metabolism produced by <a href="../../wp/c/Cell_%2528biology%2529.htm" title="Cell (biology)">cells</a>, from the tissues to the <!--del_lnk--> lungs to be exhaled.</p>
       <p>Medical terms related to blood often begin with <i><b>hemo-</b></i> or <i><b>hemato-</b></i> (<!--del_lnk--> BrE: <i>haemo-</i> and <i>haemato-</i>) from the <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a> word "<i>&alpha;&#x1F37;&mu;&alpha;</i>" for "blood." <a href="../../wp/a/Anatomy.htm" title="Anatomy">Anatomically</a> and <!--del_lnk--> histologically, blood is considered a specialized form of <!--del_lnk--> connective tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of <!--del_lnk--> fibrinogen.</p>

       <p>Blood accounts for 7% of the human body weight, with an average density of approximately 1060 kg/m&sup3;, very close to pure water's density of 1000&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The average adult has a blood volume of roughly 5 <!--del_lnk--> litres, composed of plasma and several kinds of cells (occasionally called <i>corpuscles</i>); these formed elements of the blood are erythrocytes (<!--del_lnk--> red blood cells), leukocytes (<!--del_lnk--> white blood cells) and thrombocytes (<!--del_lnk--> platelets). By volume the red blood cells constitute about 45% of whole blood, the plasma constitutes about 55%, and white cells constitute a minute volume.</p>
       <p>Whole blood (plasma and cells) exhibits <!--del_lnk--> non-Newtonian fluid dynamics; its flow properties are adapted to flow effectively through tiny capillary blood vessels with less resistance than plasma by itself. In addition, if all human hemoglobin was free in the plasma rather than being contained in RBCs, the circulatory fluid would be too viscous for the cardiovascular system to function effectively.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cells">Cells</span></h3>
       <p>One microliter of blood contains:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b>4.7 to 6.1 million (male), 4.2 to 5.4 million (female) erythrocytes:</b> In mammals, mature red blood cells lack a <!--del_lnk--> nucleus and <!--del_lnk--> organelles. They contain the blood's <!--del_lnk--> hemoglobin and distribute oxygen. The red blood cells (together with <!--del_lnk--> endothelial vessel cells and other cells) are also marked by <!--del_lnk--> glycoproteins that define the different <!--del_lnk--> blood types. The proportion of blood occupied by red blood cells is referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> hematocrit, and is normally about 45%. The combined surface area of all the red cells in the human body would be roughly 2,000 times as great as the body's exterior surface.</li>
        <li><b>4,000-11,000 leukocytes:</b> White blood cells are part of the <a href="../../wp/i/Immune_system.htm" title="Immune system">immune system</a>; they destroy and remove old or aberrant cells and cellular debris, as well as attack infectious agents (<!--del_lnk--> pathogens) and foreign substances. The cancer of leukocytes is called leukemia.</li>
        <li><b>200,000-500,000 thrombocytes:</b> Platelets are responsible for blood clotting (<!--del_lnk--> coagulation). They change <!--del_lnk--> fibrinogen into <!--del_lnk--> fibrin. This fibrin creates a mesh onto which red blood cells collect and clot, which then stops more blood from leaving the body and also helps to prevent bacteria from entering the body.</li>

       <p>About 55% of whole blood is <!--del_lnk--> blood plasma, a fluid that is the blood's liquid medium, which by itself is straw-yellow in colour. The <!--del_lnk--> blood plasma volume totals of 2.7-3.0 litres in an average human. It is essentially an <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">aqueous</a> solution containing 92% water, 8% blood plasma <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">proteins</a>, and trace amounts of other materials.

       <p>Other important <!--del_lnk--> components include:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Serum albumin</li>

        <li>Various <!--del_lnk--> electrolytes (mainly <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium.htm" title="Sodium">sodium</a> and <!--del_lnk--> chloride)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The term <i>serum</i> refers to plasma from which the clotting proteins have been removed. Most of the proteins remaining are albumin and <a href="../../wp/a/Antibody.htm" title="Antibody">immunoglobulins</a>.</p>
       <p>The normal <!--del_lnk--> pH of human arterial blood is approximately 7.40 (normal range is 7.36-7.44), a weak alkaline solution. Blood that has a pH below 7.35 is too <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Acid.htm" title="Acidic">acidic</a>, while blood pH above 7.45 is too <!--del_lnk--> alkaline. Blood pH, <!--del_lnk--> partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>), partial pressure of carbon dioxide(PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and <!--del_lnk--> HCO<sub>3</sub> are carefully regulated by a number of <!--del_lnk--> homeostatic mechanisms, which principally exert their influence through influence the <!--del_lnk--> respiratory system and the <!--del_lnk--> urinary system in the control the <!--del_lnk--> acid-base balance and respiration.

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Blood is circulated around the body through <!--del_lnk--> blood vessels by the pumping action of the <a href="../../wp/h/Heart.htm" title="Heart">heart</a>. In humans, blood is pumped from the strong left ventricle of the heart through <!--del_lnk--> arteries to peripheral <!--del_lnk--> tissues and returns to the right <!--del_lnk--> atrium of the heart through <!--del_lnk--> veins. It then enters the right <!--del_lnk--> ventricle and is pumped through the <!--del_lnk--> pulmonary artery to the <!--del_lnk--> lungs and returns to the left atrium through the <!--del_lnk--> pulmonary veins. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of <!--del_lnk--> metabolism by <a href="../../wp/c/Cell_%2528biology%2529.htm" title="Cell (biology)">cells</a>, to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries which contains the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.</p>
       <p>Additional return flow may be generated by the movement of skeletal muscles which can compress veins and push blood through the valves in veins towards the right atrium.</p>
       <p>The blood circulation was famously described by <a href="../../wp/w/William_Harvey.htm" title="William Harvey">William Harvey</a> in 1628.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Production_and_degradation_of_blood_cells">Production and degradation of blood cells</span></h3>
       <p>In vertebrates, the various cells of blood are made in the <!--del_lnk--> bone marrow in a process called <!--del_lnk--> hematopoiesis, which includes <!--del_lnk--> erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells; and myelopoiesis, the production of white blood cells and platelets. During childhood, almost every human bone produces red blood cells; as adults, red blood cell production is limited to the larger bones: the bodies of the vertebrae, the breastbone (sternum), the ribcage, the pelvic bones, and the bones of the upper arms and legs. In addition, during childhood, the <!--del_lnk--> thymus gland, found in the <!--del_lnk--> mediastinum, is an important source of <!--del_lnk--> lymphocytes. The proteinaceous component of blood (including clotting proteins) is produced predominantly by the <!--del_lnk--> liver, while hormones are produced by the <!--del_lnk--> endocrine glands and the watery fraction is regulated by the <!--del_lnk--> hypothalamus and maintained by the <a href="../../wp/k/Kidney.htm" title="Kidney">kidney</a>.</p>
       <p>Healthy erythrocytes have a plasma life of about 120 days before they are degraded by the <!--del_lnk--> spleen, and the <!--del_lnk--> Kupffer cells in the liver. The liver also clears some proteins, lipids and <a href="../../wp/a/Amino_acid.htm" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>. The kidney actively secretes waste products into the <!--del_lnk--> urine.</p>

       <p>About 98.5% of the <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human breathing air at sea-level pressure is chemically combined with the Hgb. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to Hgb. The <!--del_lnk--> hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammals">mammals</a> and many other species (for exceptions, see below).</p>
       <p>With the exception of <!--del_lnk--> pulmonary and <!--del_lnk--> umbilical arteries and their corresponding veins, <!--del_lnk--> arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the <a href="../../wp/h/Heart.htm" title="Heart">heart</a> and deliver it to the body via <!--del_lnk--> arterioles and <!--del_lnk--> capillaries, where the oxygen is consumed; afterwards, <!--del_lnk--> venules and <!--del_lnk--> veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.</p>
       <p>Under normal conditions in humans at rest, hemoglobin in blood leaving the lungs is about 98-99% saturated with oxygen. In a healthy adult at rest, <i>deoxygenated</i> blood returning to the lungs is still approximately 75% saturated. Increased oxygen consumption during sustained exercise reduces the oxygen saturation of venous blood, which can reach less than 15% in a trained athlete; although breathing rate and blood flow increase to compensate, oxygen saturation in arterial blood can drop to 95% or less under these conditions. Oxygen saturation this low is considered dangerous in an individual at rest (for instance, during surgery under anesthesia. Sustained hypoxia,(oxygenation of less than 90%) is dangerous to health, and severe hypoxia (saturations of less than 30%) may be rapidly fatal.</p>
       <p>A <!--del_lnk--> fetus, receiving oxygen via the <!--del_lnk--> placenta, is exposed to much lower oxygen pressures (about 21% of the level found in an adult's lungs) and so fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity for oxygen (hemoglobin F) in order to function under these conditions.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Carbon_dioxide_transport">Carbon dioxide transport</span></h3>
       <p>When blood flows through capillaries, carbon dioxide diffuses from the tissues into the blood. Some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood. Some carbon dioxide reacts with hemoglobin and other proteins to form <!--del_lnk--> carbamino compounds. The remaining carbon dioxide is converted to <!--del_lnk--> bicarbonate and <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen ions through the action of RBC <!--del_lnk--> carbonic anhydrase. Most carbon dioxide is transported through the blood in the form of bicarbonate ions.</p>
       <p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), the main cellular waste product is carried in blood mainly dissolved in <!--del_lnk--> plasma, in equilibrium with <!--del_lnk--> bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and <!--del_lnk--> carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). 86%-90% of CO<sub>2</sub> in the body is converted into <!--del_lnk--> carbonic acid, which can quickly turn into bicarbonate, the chemical equilibrium being important in the pH <!--del_lnk--> buffering of plasma. Blood <!--del_lnk--> pH is kept in a narrow range (pH between 7.35-7.45).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_of_hydrogen_ions">Transport of hydrogen ions</span></h3>
       <p>Some oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin binds most of the hydrogen ions as it has a much greater affinity for more hydrogen than does oxyhemoglobin.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lymphatic_system">Lymphatic system</span></h3>
       <p>In mammals, blood is in equilibrium with <!--del_lnk--> lymph, which is continuously formed in tissues from blood by capillary ultrafiltration. Lymph is collected by a system of small lymphatic vessels and directed to the <!--del_lnk--> thoracic duct, which drains into the left <!--del_lnk--> subclavian vein where lymph rejoins the systemic blood circulation.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Thermoregulation">Thermoregulation</span></h3>
       <p>Blood circulation transports <a href="../../wp/h/Heat.htm" title="Heat">heat</a> throughout the body, and adjustments to this flow are an important part of <!--del_lnk--> thermoregulation. Increasing blood flow to the surface (e.g. during warm weather or strenuous exercise) causes warmer skin, resulting in faster heat loss, while decreasing surface blood flow conserves heat.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydraulic_functions">Hydraulic functions</span></h3>
       <p>The restriction of blood flow can also be used in specialized tissues to cause engorgement resulting in an <!--del_lnk--> erection of that tissue; examples are the erectile tissue in the <!--del_lnk--> penis, <!--del_lnk--> nipples or <!--del_lnk--> clitoris.</p>
       <p>Another example of a hydraulic function is the <!--del_lnk--> jumping spider, in which blood forced into the legs under pressure causes them to straighten for a powerful jump, without the need for bulky muscular legs.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Invertebrates">Invertebrates</span></h3>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a>, the blood (more properly called <!--del_lnk--> hemolymph) is not involved in the transport of oxygen. (Openings called <!--del_lnk--> tracheae allow oxygen from the air to diffuse directly to the tissues). Insect blood moves nutrients to the tissues and removes waste products in an open system.</p>
       <p>Other invertebrates use respiratory proteins to increase the oxygen carrying capacity. Hemoglobin is the most common respiratory protein found in nature. <!--del_lnk--> Hemocyanin (<!--del_lnk--> blue) contains <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> and is found in <a href="../../wp/c/Crustacean.htm" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a> and <!--del_lnk--> mollusks. It is thought that <!--del_lnk--> tunicates (sea squirts) might use <!--del_lnk--> vanabins (<a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">proteins</a> containing <a href="../../wp/v/Vanadium.htm" title="Vanadium">vanadium</a>) for respiratory pigment (bright green, blue, or orange).</p>
       <p>In many invertebrates, these oxygen-carrying proteins are freely soluble in the blood; in vertebrates they are contained in specialized <!--del_lnk--> red blood cells, allowing for a higher concentration of respiratory pigments without increasing <!--del_lnk--> viscosity or damaging blood filtering organs like the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/k/Kidney.htm" title="Kidneys">kidneys</a>.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Giant tube worms have unusual hemoglobins that allow them to live in extraordinary environments. These hemoglobins also carry sulfides normally fatal in other animals.</p>

       <p>Hemoglobin is the principal determinant of the color of blood in vertebrates. Each molecule has four heme groups, and their interaction with various molecules alters the exact colour. In <a href="../../wp/v/Vertebrate.htm" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a> and other hemoglobin-using creatures, arterial blood and capillary blood are bright red as oxygen imparts a strong red colour to the heme group. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red; this is present in veins, and can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. Blood in <!--del_lnk--> carbon monoxide poisoning is bright red, because <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_monoxide.htm" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> causes the formation of <!--del_lnk--> carboxyhemoglobin. In <!--del_lnk--> cyanide poisoning, the body cannot utilize oxygen, so the venous blood remains oxygenated, increasing the redness. While hemoglobin containing blood is never blue, there are several conditions and diseases where the colour of the heme groups make the skin appear blue. If the heme is oxidized, <!--del_lnk--> methemoglobin, which is more brownish and cannot transport oxygen, is formed. In the rare condition <!--del_lnk--> sulfhemoglobinemia, arterial hemoglobin is partially oxygenated, and appears dark-red with a bluish hue (<!--del_lnk--> cyanosis).</p>
       <p>Veins in the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons only weakly dependent on the color of the blood. Light scattering in the skin, and the visual processing of colour play roles as well.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Skinks in the genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Prasinohaema</i> have green blood due to a buildup of the waste product <!--del_lnk--> biliverdin.</p>

Hemocyanin is colourless when deoxygenated and dark blue when oxygenated. The blood in the circulation of these creatures, which generally live in cold environments with low oxygen tensions, is grey-white to pale yellow, and it turns dark blue when exposed to the oxygen in the air, as seen when they bleed. This is due to change in colour of <!--del_lnk--> hemocyanin when is it oxidized. Hemocyanin carries oxygen in extracellular fluid, which is in contrast to the intracellular oxygen transport in mammals by hemoglobin in RBCs.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vacuum">Vacuum</span></h3>
       <p>If human blood was exposed to vacuum, it would lose all oxygen (bound to the hemoglobin molecules in its red cells) as it does in part when it supplies oxygen to various organs as it passes through the body. This state of deoxyhemoglobin has a purplish colour.</p>

       <p>Due to its importance to life, blood is associated with a large number of beliefs. One of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol for family relationships; to be "related by blood" is to be related by ancestry or descendance, rather than marriage. This bears closely to <!--del_lnk--> bloodlines, and sayings such as "<!--del_lnk--> blood is thicker than water" and "<!--del_lnk--> bad blood", as well as "<!--del_lnk--> Blood brother". Blood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions because <!--del_lnk--> Leviticus 17:11 says "the life of a creature is in the blood." This phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood, due to its practice in idol worship by surrounding societies.</p>
       <p>Mythic references to blood can sometimes be connected to the living-giving nature of blood, seen in such events as <!--del_lnk--> childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death.</p>

       <blockquote>
        <p>In many Aboriginal rituals and ceremonies, red ochre is rubbed all over the naked bodies of the dancers. In secret, sacred male ceremonies, blood extracted from the veins of the participant's arms is exchanged and rubbed on their bodies. Red ochre is used in similar ways in less secret ceremonies.
