       <p><b>Buddhism</b> is a <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> indigenous to the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and practices largely based on teachings attributed to <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Siddhartha Gautama</a>, who is commonly known as the <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhahood.htm" title="Buddhahood">Buddha</a> (meaning "the awakened one" in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> and <!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li). The Buddha lived and taught in the eastern part of the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE. He is recognized by Buddhists as an <!--del_lnk--> awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help <!--del_lnk--> sentient beings end suffering (<!--del_lnk--> dukkha) through eliminating ignorance (<!--del_lnk--> avidy&#x101;) by way of understanding and seeing dependent origination (<!--del_lnk--> prat&#x12B;tyasamutp&#x101;da) and eliminating craving (<!--del_lnk--> ta&#x1E47;h&#x101;), and thus attain the highest happiness, <!--del_lnk--> nirv&#x101;&#x146;a.</p>
       <p>Two major branches of Buddhism are generally recognized: <!--del_lnk--> Theravada ("The School of the Elders") and <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana ("The Great Vehicle"). Theravada has a widespread following in <!--del_lnk--> Sri Lanka and <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar etc.). Mahayana is found throughout <!--del_lnk--> East Asia (China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan etc.) and includes the traditions of <!--del_lnk--> Pure Land, <!--del_lnk--> Zen, <!--del_lnk--> Nichiren Buddhism, <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism, <!--del_lnk--> Shingon, and <!--del_lnk--> Tiantai (<!--del_lnk--> Tendai). In some classifications, <!--del_lnk--> Vajrayana&mdash;practiced mainly in <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, and adjacent parts of <!--del_lnk--> China and <!--del_lnk--> Russia&mdash;is recognized as a third branch, while others classify it as a part of Mahayana.</p>
       <p>While Buddhism remains most popular within Asia, both branches are now found throughout the world. Estimates of Buddhists worldwide vary significantly depending on the way Buddhist adherence is defined. Conservative estimates are between 350 and 750 million. Higher estimates are between 1.2 and 1.7 billion. It is also recognized as one of the fastest growing religions in the world.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to <!--del_lnk--> liberation, the importance and <!--del_lnk--> canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the <!--del_lnk--> Three Jewels: the Buddha, the <!--del_lnk--> Dharma (the teachings), and the <!--del_lnk--> Sangha (the community). Taking "<!--del_lnk--> refuge in the triple gem" has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices may include following <!--del_lnk--> ethical precepts; <!--del_lnk--> support of the monastic community; <!--del_lnk--> renouncing conventional living and becoming a <!--del_lnk--> monastic; the development of <!--del_lnk--> mindfulness and practice of <!--del_lnk--> meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; <!--del_lnk--> devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and <!--del_lnk--> bodhisattvas.</p>

       <p>This narrative draws on the <i><!--del_lnk--> Nid&#x101;nakath&#x101;</i> biography of the <!--del_lnk--> Therav&#x101;da sect in Sri Lanka, which is ascribed to <!--del_lnk--> Buddhagho&#x1E63;a in the 5th century CE. Earlier biographies such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Buddhacarita</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> Lokottarav&#x101;din <i><!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;vastu</i>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na / <!--del_lnk--> Sarv&#x101;stiv&#x101;da <i><!--del_lnk--> Lalitavistara S&#x16B;tra</i>, give different accounts. Scholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life. Most accept that he lived, taught and founded a monastic order, but do not consistently accept all of the details contained in his biographies.</p>

       <p>According to author Michael Carrithers, while there are good reasons to doubt the traditional account, "the outline of the life must be true: birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death." In writing her biography of the Buddha, <!--del_lnk--> Karen Armstrong noted, "It is obviously difficult, therefore, to write a biography of the Buddha that meets modern criteria, because we have very little information that can be considered historically sound... [but] we can be reasonably confident Siddhatta Gotama did indeed exist and that his disciples preserved the memory of his life and teachings as well as they could."</p>
       <p>The evidence of the early texts suggests that <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Siddh&#x101;rtha Gautama</a> was born in a community that was on the periphery, both geographically and culturally, of the northeastern Indian subcontinent in the 5th century BCE. It was either a small <!--del_lnk--> republic, in which case his father was an elected chieftain, or an <a href="../../wp/o/Oligarchy.htm" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a>, in which case his father was an oligarch.</p>

       <p>According to the Theravada <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tripi%25E1%25B9%25ADaka.htm" title="Tripitaka">Tripitaka</a> <!--del_lnk--> scriptures (from Pali, meaning "three baskets"), Gautama was born in <!--del_lnk--> Lumbini in modern-day <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>, around the year 563 BCE, and raised in <!--del_lnk--> Kapilavastu.</p>
       <p>According to this narrative, shortly after the birth of young prince Gautama, an <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrologer</a> visited the young prince's father&mdash;King <!--del_lnk--> &#x15A;uddhodana&mdash;and prophesied that Siddhartha would either become a great king or renounce the material world to become a holy man, depending on whether he saw what life was like outside the palace walls.</p>
       <p>&#x15A;uddhodana was determined to see his son become a king, so he prevented him from leaving the palace grounds. But at age 29, despite his father's efforts, Gautama ventured beyond the palace several times. In a series of encounters&mdash;known in Buddhist literature as the <!--del_lnk--> four sights&mdash;he learned of the suffering of ordinary people, encountering an old man, a sick man, a corpse and, finally, an <!--del_lnk--> ascetic <!--del_lnk--> holy man, apparently content and at peace with the world. These experiences prompted Gautama to abandon royal life and take up a spiritual quest.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day, and mastered the meditative attainments they taught. But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering, so he continued his quest. He next attempted an extreme asceticism, which was a religious pursuit common among the <!--del_lnk--> Shramanas, a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one. Gautama underwent prolonged fasting, breath-holding, and exposure to pain. He almost starved himself to death in the process. He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit, and had not put an end to suffering. So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach. He devoted himself to <!--del_lnk--> anapanasati meditation, through which he discovered what Buddhists call the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Way (Skt. <i>madhyam&#x101;-pratipad</i>): a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.</p>

       <p>Gautama was now determined to complete his spiritual quest. At the age of 35, he famously sat in <!--del_lnk--> meditation under a <!--del_lnk--> sacred fig tree &mdash; known as the <!--del_lnk--> Bodhi tree &mdash; in the town of <!--del_lnk--> Bodh Gaya, India, and vowed not to rise before achieving <!--del_lnk--> enlightenment. After many days, he finally destroyed the <!--del_lnk--> fetters of his mind, thereby <!--del_lnk--> liberating himself from the <!--del_lnk--> cycle of suffering and rebirth, and arose as a <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhahood.htm#Samyaksambuddha" title="Buddhahood">fully enlightened being</a> (Skt. <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">samyaksa&#x1E43;buddha</span></i>). Soon thereafter, he attracted a band of followers and instituted a <!--del_lnk--> monastic order. Now, as the Buddha, he spent the rest of his life teaching the <!--del_lnk--> path of awakening he had discovered, traveling throughout the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent, and died at the age of 80 (483 BCE) in <!--del_lnk--> Kushinagar, India. The south branch of the original fig tree available only in <!--del_lnk--> Anuradhapura <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> is known as <!--del_lnk--> Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi.</p>

       <p>Samsara is "the cycle of birth and death". Sentient beings crave pleasure and are averse to pain from birth to death. In being controlled by these attitudes, they perpetuate the cycle of conditioned existence and suffering (sa&#x1E43;s&#x101;ra), and produce the causes and conditions of the next rebirth after death. Each rebirth repeats this process in an involuntary cycle, which Buddhists strive to end by eradicating these causes and conditions, applying the methods laid out by the Buddha and subsequent Buddhists.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Karma">Karma</span></h4>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Karma (from <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>: "action, work") <!--del_lnk--> in Buddhism is the force that drives <!--del_lnk--> sa&#x1E43;s&#x101;ra&mdash;the cycle of suffering and rebirth for each being. Good, skillful deeds (<!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li: "kusala") and bad, unskillful (P&#x101;li: "akusala") actions produce "seeds" in the mind that <!--del_lnk--> come to fruition either in this life or in a subsequent <!--del_lnk--> rebirth. The avoidance of unwholesome actions and the cultivation of positive actions is called <!--del_lnk--> &#x15B;&#x12B;la (from Sanskrit: "ethical conduct").</p>
       <p>In Buddhism, karma specifically refers to those actions (of body, speech, and mind) that spring from mental intent ("<!--del_lnk--> cetana"), and bring about a consequence or fruit, (<i><!--del_lnk--> phala</i>) or result (<i><!--del_lnk--> vip&#x101;ka</i>).</p>
       <p>In Theravada Buddhism there can be no divine salvation or forgiveness for one's karma, since it is a purely impersonal process that is a part of the makeup of the universe. In Mahayana Buddhism, the texts of certain <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana sutras (such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Lotus Sutra</i>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Angulimaliya Sutra</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Nirvana Sutra</i>) claim that reciting or merely hearing their texts can expunge great swathes of negative karma. Some forms of Buddhism (for example, <!--del_lnk--> Vajrayana) regard the recitation of <!--del_lnk--> mantras as a means for cutting off previous negative karma. The Japanese <!--del_lnk--> Pure Land teacher <!--del_lnk--> Genshin taught that <!--del_lnk--> Amida Buddha has the power to destroy the karma that would otherwise bind one in sa&#x1E43;s&#x101;ra.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of <!--del_lnk--> sentient life, each running from conception to death. Buddhism rejects the concepts of a permanent <!--del_lnk--> self or an unchanging, eternal <!--del_lnk--> soul, as it is called in <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. According to Buddhism there ultimately is no such thing as a self independent from the rest of the universe (the doctrine of <!--del_lnk--> anatta). Rebirth in subsequent existences must be understood as the continuation of a dynamic, ever-changing process of "dependent arising" ("<!--del_lnk--> prat&#x12B;tyasamutp&#x101;da") determined by the laws of cause and effect (karma) rather than that of one being, <!--del_lnk--> transmigrating or <!--del_lnk--> incarnating from one existence to the next.</p>
       <p>Each rebirth takes place within one of five realms according to Theravadins, or <!--del_lnk--> six according to other schools. These are further subdivided into 31 planes of existence:</p>
       <ol>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Naraka beings: those who live in one of many Narakas (Hells);</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Preta: sometimes sharing some space with humans, but invisible to most people; an important variety is the <!--del_lnk--> hungry ghost;</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Animals: sharing space with humans, but considered another type of life;</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Human beings: one of the realms of rebirth in which attaining Nirvana is possible;</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Asuras: variously translated as lowly deities, demons, titans, antigods; not recognized by Therav&#x101;da (Mahavihara) tradition as a separate realm;</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Devas including <!--del_lnk--> Brahmas: variously translated as gods, deities, spirits, angels, or left untranslated.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>Rebirths in some of the higher heavens, known as the <!--del_lnk--> &#x15A;uddh&#x101;v&#x101;sa Worlds (Pure Abodes), can be attained by only skilled Buddhist practitioners known as <!--del_lnk--> an&#x101;g&#x101;mis (non-returners). Rebirths in the <!--del_lnk--> arupa-dhatu (formless realms) can be attained by only those who can meditate on the <!--del_lnk--> ar&#x16B;pajh&#x101;nas, the highest object of meditation.</p>
       <p>According to East Asian and <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism, there is an <!--del_lnk--> intermediate state (<!--del_lnk--> Tibetan "Bardo") between one life and the next. The orthodox Theravada position rejects this; however there are passages in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Samyutta Nikaya</i> of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/P%25C4%2581li_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a> (the collection of texts on which the Theravada tradition is based), that seem to lend support to the idea that the Buddha taught of an intermediate stage between one life and the next.</p>

       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Four_Noble_Truths">The Four Noble Truths</span></h4>
       <p>The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism, and are said to provide a conceptual framework for Buddhist thought. These four truths explain the nature of <i><!--del_lnk--> dukkha</i> (suffering, anxiety, dissatisfaction), its causes, and how it can be overcome. The four truths are:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>The truth of <i>dukkha</i> (suffering, anxiety, dissatisfaction)</li>
        <li>The truth of the origin of <i>dukkha</i></li>
        <li>The truth of the cessation of <i>dukkha</i></li>
        <li>The truth of the path leading to the cessation of <i>dukkha</i></li>
       </ol>
       <p>The first truth explains the nature of <i><!--del_lnk--> dukkha</i>. <i>Dukkha</i> is commonly translated as &ldquo;suffering&rdquo;, &ldquo;anxiety&rdquo;, &ldquo;dissatisfaction&rdquo;, &ldquo;unease&rdquo;, etc., and it is said to have the following three aspects:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>the obvious suffering of physical and mental illness, growing old, and dying;</li>
        <li>the anxiety or stress of trying to hold onto things that are constantly changing; and</li>
        <li>a subtle dissatisfaction pervading all forms of life, due to the fact that all forms of life are impermanent and constantly changing.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The second truth is that the <i><!--del_lnk--> origin</i> of <i>dukkha</i> can be known. Within the context of the four noble truths, the origin of <i>dukkha</i> is commonly explained as craving (Pali: <i><!--del_lnk--> tanha</i>) conditioned by ignorance (Pali: <i><!--del_lnk--> avijja</i>). On a deeper level, the root cause of <i>dukkha</i> is identified as ignorance (Pali: <i><!--del_lnk--> avijja</i>) of the true nature of things. The third noble truth is that the complete <i><!--del_lnk--> cessation</i> of <i>dukkha</i> is possible, and the fourth noble truth identifies a <i><!--del_lnk--> path</i> to this cessation.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Noble Eightfold Path&mdash;the fourth of the Buddha's <!--del_lnk--> Noble Truths&mdash;consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions, that when developed together, lead to the cessation of <!--del_lnk--> dukkha. These eight factors are: Right View (or Right Understanding), Right Intention (or Right Thought), Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Ajahn Sucitto describes the path as "a mandala of interconnected factors that support and moderate each other." The eight factors of the path are <i>not</i> to be understood as stages, in which each stage is completed before moving on to the next. Rather, they are understood as eight significant dimensions of one's behaviour&mdash;mental, spoken, and bodily&mdash;that operate in dependence on one another; taken together, they define a complete <i>path</i>, or way of living.</p>
       <p>The eight factors of the path are commonly presented within three divisions (or higher trainings) as shown below:</p>

       <p>While he searched for enlightenment, Gautama combined the <!--del_lnk--> yoga practice of his teacher Kalama with what later became known as "the immeasurables". Gautama thus invented a new kind of human, one without <!--del_lnk--> egotism. What <!--del_lnk--> Thich Nhat Hanh calls the "Four Immeasurable Minds" of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity are also known as <!--del_lnk--> brahmaviharas, divine abodes, or simply as four immeasurables. <!--del_lnk--> Pema Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n calls them the "four limitless ones". Of the four, <!--del_lnk--> mett&#x101; or loving-kindness meditation is perhaps the best known. The Four Immeasurables are taught as a form of meditation that cultivates "wholesome attitudes towards all sentient beings." The practitioner prays:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>May all sentient beings have happiness and its causes,</li>
        <li>May all sentient beings be free of suffering and its causes,</li>
        <li>May all sentient beings never be separated from bliss without suffering,</li>
        <li>May all sentient beings be in equanimity, free of bias, attachment and anger.</li>

       <p>An important guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Way (or Middle Path), which is said to have been discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment. The Middle Way has several definitions:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>The practice of non-extremism: a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification;</li>
        <li>The middle ground between certain <!--del_lnk--> metaphysical <!--del_lnk--> views (for example, that things ultimately either do or do not exist);</li>
        <li>An explanation of <!--del_lnk--> Nirvana (perfect enlightenment), a state wherein it becomes clear that all dualities apparent in the world are delusory (see <!--del_lnk--> Seongcheol);</li>
        <li>Another term for <!--del_lnk--> emptiness, the ultimate nature of all phenomena (in the <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana branch), a lack of inherent existence, which avoids the extremes of permanence and nihilism or inherent existence and nothingness.</li>

       <p>Buddhist scholars have produced a remarkable quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and world view concepts (see, for example, <!--del_lnk--> Abhidharma, <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist philosophy and <!--del_lnk--> Reality in Buddhism). Some schools of Buddhism discourage doctrinal study, and some regard it as essential practice.</p>
       <p>The concept of liberation (<!--del_lnk--> nirv&#x101;&#x1E47;a)&mdash;the goal of the Buddhist path&mdash;is closely related to overcoming ignorance (<!--del_lnk--> avidy&#x101;), a fundamental misunderstanding or mis-perception of the nature of reality. In awakening to the true nature of the self and all phenomena one develops dispassion for the objects of <!--del_lnk--> clinging, and is liberated from suffering (<!--del_lnk--> dukkha) and the cycle of incessant rebirths (<!--del_lnk--> sa&#x1E43;s&#x101;ra). To this end, the Buddha recommended viewing things as characterized by the <!--del_lnk--> three marks of existence.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Three_Marks_of_Existence">Three Marks of Existence</span></h4>
       <p>The Three Marks of Existence are impermanence, suffering, and not-self.</p>
       <p>Impermanence (P&#x101;li: <i><!--del_lnk--> anicca</i>) expresses the Buddhist notion that all <!--del_lnk--> compounded or conditioned phenomena (all things and experiences) are inconstant, unsteady, and impermanent. Everything we can experience through our senses is made up of parts, and its existence is dependent on external conditions. Everything is in constant flux, and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing. Things are constantly coming into being, and ceasing to be. Since nothing lasts, there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience. According to the doctrine of impermanence, life embodies this flux in the aging process, the cycle of rebirth (sa&#x1E43;s&#x101;ra), and in any experience of loss. The doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent, attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering (dukkha).</p>
       <p>Suffering (P&#x101;li: &#x926;&#x941;&#x915;&#x94D;&#x916; <i>dukkha</i>; Sanskrit &#x926;&#x941;&#x903;&#x916; <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">du&#x1E25;kha</span></i>) is also a central concept in Buddhism. The word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in English including <!--del_lnk--> suffering, <!--del_lnk--> pain, unsatisfactoriness, sorrow, affliction, <!--del_lnk--> anxiety, dissatisfaction, discomfort, <!--del_lnk--> anguish, <!--del_lnk--> stress, misery, and <!--del_lnk--> frustration. Although the term is often translated as "suffering", its philosophical meaning is more analogous to "disquietude" as in the condition of being disturbed. As such, "suffering" is too narrow a translation with "negative emotional connotations" that can give the impression that the Buddhist view is <!--del_lnk--> pessimistic, but Buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but realistic. In English-language Buddhist literature translated from P&#x101;li, "dukkha" is often left untranslated, so as to encompass its full range of meaning.</p>
       <p>Not-self (P&#x101;li: <i><!--del_lnk--> anatta</i>; Sanskrit: <i>an&#x101;tman</i>) is the third mark of existence. Upon careful examination, one finds that no phenomenon is really "I" or "mine"; these concepts are in fact constructed by the mind. In the <i><!--del_lnk--> Nikayas</i> anatta is not meant as a metaphysical assertion, but as an approach for gaining release from suffering. In fact, the Buddha rejected both of the metaphysical assertions "I have a <!--del_lnk--> Self" and "I have no Self" as <!--del_lnk--> ontological <!--del_lnk--> views that bind one to suffering. When asked if the self was identical with the body, the Buddha <!--del_lnk--> refused to answer. By analyzing the constantly changing physical and mental constituents (<!--del_lnk--> skandhas) of a person or object, the practitioner comes to the conclusion that neither the respective parts nor the person as a whole comprise a self.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Dependent_arising">Dependent arising</span></h4>
       <p>The doctrine of prat&#x12B;tyasamutp&#x101;da (Sanskrit; Pali: paticcasamupp&#x101;da; Tibetan: rten.cing.'brel.bar.'byung.ba; Chinese: &#x7DE3;&#x8D77;) is an important part of Buddhist metaphysics. It states that phenomena arise together in a mutually interdependent web of cause and effect. It is variously rendered into English as "dependent origination", "conditioned genesis", "dependent co-arising", "interdependent arising", or "contingency".</p>
       <p>The best-known application of the concept of prat&#x12B;tyasamutp&#x101;da is the scheme of <!--del_lnk--> Twelve Nid&#x101;nas (from P&#x101;li "nid&#x101;na" meaning "cause, foundation, source or origin"), which explain the continuation of the cycle of suffering and rebirth (sa&#x1E43;s&#x101;ra) in detail.</p>
       <p>The Twelve Nid&#x101;nas describe a causal connection between the subsequent characteristics or conditions of cyclic existence, each one giving rise to the next:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Avidy&#x101;: ignorance, specifically spiritual ignorance of the nature of reality;</li>
        <li>Sa&#x1E43;sk&#x101;ras: literally formations, explained as referring to <!--del_lnk--> karma;</li>
        <li>Vij&ntilde;&#x101;na: <!--del_lnk--> consciousness, specifically discriminative;</li>
        <li>N&#x101;mar&#x16B;pa: literally name and form, referring to mind and body;</li>
        <li>&#x1E62;a&#x1E0D;&#x101;yatana: the six sense bases: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind-organ;</li>
        <li>Spar&#x15B;a: variously translated contact, impression, stimulation (by a sense object);</li>
        <li>Vedan&#x101;: usually translated feeling: this is the "hedonic tone", i.e. whether something is pleasant, unpleasant or neutral;</li>
        <li>T&#x1E5B;&#x1E63;&#x1E47;&#x101;: literally thirst, but in Buddhism nearly always used to mean craving;</li>
        <li>Up&#x101;d&#x101;na: clinging or grasping; the word also means fuel, which feeds the continuing cycle of rebirth;</li>
        <li>Bhava: literally being (existence) or becoming. (The Theravada explains this as having two meanings: karma, which produces a new existence, and the existence itself.);</li>
        <li>J&#x101;ti: literally birth, but life is understood as starting at conception;</li>
        <li>Jar&#x101;mara&#x1E47;a: (old age and death) and also &#x15B;okaparidevadu&#x1E25;khadaurmanasyop&#x101;y&#x101;sa (sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and misery).</li>
       </ol>
       <p>Sentient beings always suffer throughout sa&#x1E43;s&#x101;ra, until they free themselves from this suffering by attaining <!--del_lnk--> Nirvana. Then the absence of the first Nid&#x101;na&mdash;ignorance&mdash;leads to the absence of the others.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Emptiness">Emptiness</span></h4>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from <!--del_lnk--> Nagarjuna (perhaps c. 150&ndash;250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahayana tradition. Nagarjuna's primary contribution to <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist philosophy was the systematic exposition of the concept of <!--del_lnk--> &#x15B;&#x16B;nyat&#x101;, or "emptiness", widely attested in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Praj&ntilde;&#x101;p&#x101;ramit&#x101;</i> sutras that emerged in his era. The concept of emptiness brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anatta and prat&#x12B;tyasamutp&#x101;da (dependent origination), to refute the metaphysics of <!--del_lnk--> Sarvastivada and <!--del_lnk--> Sautrantika (extinct non-Mahayana schools). For Nagarjuna, it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of <!--del_lnk--> &#x101;tman; all phenomena (<!--del_lnk--> dharmas) are without any <!--del_lnk--> svabhava (literally "own-nature" or "self-nature"), and thus without any underlying essence; they are "empty" of being independent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. Nagarjuna's school of thought is known as the <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;dhyamaka. Some of the writings attributed to Nagarjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the <!--del_lnk--> agamas. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent <!--del_lnk--> exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the Canon. In the eyes of Nagarjuna the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the M&#x101;dhyamaka system.</p>
       <p>Sarvastivada teachings&mdash;which were criticized by N&#x101;g&#x101;rjuna&mdash;were reformulated by scholars such as <!--del_lnk--> Vasubandhu and <!--del_lnk--> Asanga and were adapted into the <!--del_lnk--> Yogacara (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the M&#x101;dhyamaka school held that asserting the existence or non-existence of any ultimately real thing was inappropriate, some exponents of Yogacara asserted that the mind and only the mind is ultimately real (a doctrine known as <!--del_lnk--> cittamatra). Not all Yogacarins asserted that mind was truly existent; Vasubandhu and Asanga in particular did not. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahayana metaphysics in the Indo-Tibetan tradition.</p>
       <p>Besides emptiness, Mahayana schools often place emphasis on the notions of perfected spiritual insight (<!--del_lnk--> praj&ntilde;&#x101;p&#x101;ramit&#x101;) and Buddha-nature (<!--del_lnk--> tath&#x101;gatagarbha). There are conflicting interpretations of the <i>tath&#x101;gatagarbha</i> in Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na thought. The idea may be traced to <i><!--del_lnk--> Abhidharma</i>, and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the <i>Nik&#x101;yas</i>. In <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism, according to the <!--del_lnk--> Sakya school, tath&#x101;gatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. In <!--del_lnk--> Nyingma, tath&#x101;gatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Gelug school, it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty (i.e. dependently originated). According to the <!--del_lnk--> Jonang school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc. when adventitious obscurations are removed. The "<!--del_lnk--> Tath&#x101;gatagarbha Sutras" are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature. Even though this collection was generally ignored in India, East Asian Buddhism provides some significance to these texts.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Nirvana (Sanskrit; Pali: "Nibbana") means "cessation", "extinction" (of <!--del_lnk--> craving and <!--del_lnk--> ignorance and therefore <!--del_lnk--> suffering and the cycle of involuntary rebirths (<!--del_lnk--> sa&#x1E43;s&#x101;ra)), "extinguished", "quieted", "calmed"; it is also known as "Awakening" or "Enlightenment" in the West. The term for anybody who has achieved <i>nirvana</i>, including the Buddha, is <i><!--del_lnk--> arahant</i>.</p>
       <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Bodhi</i> (P&#x101;li and Sanskrit, in <!--del_lnk--> devanagari: &#x92C;&#x94A;&#x927;&#x93F;) is a term applied to the experience of Awakening of arahants. <i>Bodhi</i> literally means "awakening", but it is more commonly translated into English as "enlightenment". In <!--del_lnk--> Early Buddhism, <i>bodhi</i> carried a meaning synonymous to <i>nirvana</i>, using only some different metaphors to describe the experience, which implies the extinction of <i>raga</i> (greed, craving), <i>dosa</i> (hate, aversion) and <i>moha</i> (delusion). In the later school of <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhism, the status of <i>nirvana</i> was downgraded in some scriptures, coming to refer only to the extinction of greed and hate, implying that delusion was still present in one who attained <i>nirvana</i>, and that one needed to attain <i>bodhi</i> to eradicate delusion:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">An important development in the Mahayana [was] that it came to separate nirvana from bodhi ('awakening' to the truth, Enlightenment), and to put a lower value on the former (Gombrich, 1992d). Originally nirvana and bodhi refer to the same thing; they merely use different metaphors for the experience. But the Mahayana tradition separated them and considered that nirvana referred only to the extinction of craving (passion and hatred), with the resultant escape from the cycle of rebirth. This interpretation ignores the third fire, delusion: the extinction of delusion is of course in the early texts identical with what can be positively expressed as <!--del_lnk--> gnosis, Enlightenment.</div>
        <div class="templatequotecite">&mdash;Richard F. Gombrich,&nbsp;<cite><i>How Buddhism Began</i></cite></div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Therefore, according to Mahayana Buddhism, the <i><!--del_lnk--> arahant</i> has attained only <i>nirvana</i>, thus still being subject to delusion, while the <i><!--del_lnk--> bodhisattva</i> not only achieves <i>nirvana</i> but full liberation from delusion as well. He thus attains <i>bodhi</i> and becomes a <i>buddha.</i> In Theravada Buddhism, <i>bodhi</i> and <i>nirvana</i> carry the same meaning as in the early texts, that of being freed from greed, hate and delusion.</p>
       <p>The term <i><!--del_lnk--> parinirvana</i> is also encountered in Buddhism, and this generally refers to the complete <i>nirvana</i> attained by the <i>arahant</i> at the moment of death, when the physical body expires.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Buddhas">Buddhas</span></h4>
       <p>According to Buddhist traditions a Buddha is a fully awakened being who has completely purified his mind of the <!--del_lnk--> three poisons of <!--del_lnk--> desire, aversion and <!--del_lnk--> ignorance. A Buddha is no longer bound by <!--del_lnk--> Samsara, and has ended the <!--del_lnk--> suffering which unawakened people experience in life.</p>
       <p>Buddhists do not consider <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Siddhartha Gautama">Siddhartha Gautama</a> to have been the only Buddha.

       <p>In Theravada doctrine, a person may awaken from the "sleep of ignorance" by directly realizing the true nature of <!--del_lnk--> reality; such people are called <i><!--del_lnk--> arahants</i> and occasionally <i>buddhas.</i> After numerous lifetimes of spiritual striving, they have reached the end of the cycle of rebirth, no longer reincarnating as human, animal, ghost, or other being.

       <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana, the Buddha tends not to be viewed as merely human, but as the earthly projection of a beginningless and endless, omnipresent being (see <i><!--del_lnk--> Dharmakaya</i>) beyond the range and reach of thought. Moreover, in certain Mahayana sutras, the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are viewed essentially as One: all three are seen as the <!--del_lnk--> eternal Buddha himself.</p>
       <p>The Buddha's death is seen as an illusion, he is living on in other planes of existence, and monks are therefore permitted to offer "new truths" based on his input. Mahayana also differs from Theravada in its concept of <!--del_lnk--> &#x15B;&#x16B;nyat&#x101; (that ultimately nothing has existence), and in its belief in <!--del_lnk--> bodhisattvas (enlightened people who vow to continue being reborn until all beings can be enlightened).</p>
       <p>Celestial Buddhas are individuals who no longer exist on the material plane of existence, but who still aid in the enlightenment of all beings.</p>
       <p>Nirvana came to refer only to the extinction of greed and hate, implying that delusion was still present in one who attained Nirvana. Bodhi became a higher attainment that eradicates delusion entirely. Thus, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Arahant</i> attains Nirvana but not Bodhi, thus still being subject to delusion, while the <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhahood.htm" title="Buddhahood">Buddha</a> attains Bodhi.</p>
       <p>The method of self-exertion or "self-power"&mdash;without reliance on an external force or being&mdash;stands in contrast to another major form of Buddhism, <!--del_lnk--> Pure Land, which is characterised by utmost trust in the salvific "other-power" of <!--del_lnk--> Amitabha Buddha. Pure Land Buddhism is a very widespread and perhaps the most faith-orientated manifestation of Buddhism and centres upon the conviction that faith in Amitabha Buddha and the chanting of homage to his name liberates one at death into the Blissful (&#x5B89;&#x6A02;), Pure Land (&#x6DE8;&#x571F;) of Amitabha Buddha. This Buddhic realm is variously construed as a foretaste of Nirvana, or as essentially Nirvana itself. The great vow of Amitabha Buddha to rescue all beings from <!--del_lnk--> samsaric suffering is viewed within Pure Land Buddhism as universally efficacious, if only one has faith in the power of that vow or chants his name.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Buddha_eras">Buddha eras</span></h4>
       <p>Buddhists believe <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> was the first to achieve enlightenment in this Buddha era and is therefore credited with the establishment of Buddhism. A Buddha era is the stretch of history during which people remember and practice the teachings of the earliest <i>known</i> Buddha. This Buddha era will end when all the knowledge, evidence and teachings of Gautama Buddha have vanished. This belief therefore maintains that many Buddha eras have started and ended throughout the course of human existence. The Gautama Buddha, then, is <i>the Buddha of this era</i>, who taught directly or indirectly to all other Buddhas in it (see types of Buddhas).</p>
       <p>In addition, Mahayana Buddhists believe there are innumerable other Buddhas in other universes. A Theravada commentary says that Buddhas arise one at a time in this world element, and not at all in others. The understandings of this matter reflect widely differing interpretations of basic terms, such as "world realm", between the various schools of Buddhism.</p>
       <p>The idea of the decline and gradual disappearance of the teaching has been influential in East Asian Buddhism. Pure Land Buddhism holds that it has declined to the point where few are capable of following the path, so it may be best to rely on the power of the Amitabha Buddha.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Bodhisattvas">Bodhisattvas</span></h4>
       <p><i>Bodhisattva</i> means "enlightenment being", and generally refers to one who is on the path to buddhahood. Traditionally, a bodhisattva is anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated <i><!--del_lnk--> bodhicitta</i>, which is a spontaneous wish to attain <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhahood.htm" title="Buddhahood">Buddhahood</a> for the benefit of all <!--del_lnk--> sentient beings. Theravada Buddhism primarily uses the term in relation to Gautama Buddha's previous existences, but has traditionally acknowledged and respected the bodhisattva path as well.</p>
       <p>According to Jan Nattier, the term <i>Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na</i> ("Great Vehicle") was originally even an honorary synonym for <i>Bodhisattvay&#x101;na</i>, or the "Bodhisattva Vehicle." The <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">A&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;as&#x101;hasrik&#x101; Praj&ntilde;&#x101;p&#x101;ramit&#x101; S&#x16B;tra</span></i>, an early and important Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na text, contains a simple and brief definition for the term <i>bodhisattva</i>, and this definition is the following:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">Because he has enlightenment as his aim, a bodhisattva-mah&#x101;sattva is so called.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas and to take the <!--del_lnk--> bodhisattva vows. With these vows, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all beings by practicing six perfections (Skt. <i><!--del_lnk--> p&#x101;ramit&#x101;</i>). According to the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na teachings, these perfections are: <!--del_lnk--> giving, <!--del_lnk--> discipline, <!--del_lnk--> forbearance, <!--del_lnk--> effort, <!--del_lnk--> meditation, and <!--del_lnk--> transcendent wisdom.</p>
       <p>A famous saying by the 8th-century Indian Buddhist scholar-saint <!--del_lnk--> Shantideva, which the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_Dalai_Lama.htm" title="14th Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a> often cites as his favourite verse, summarizes the Bodhisattva's intention (<!--del_lnk--> Bodhicitta) as follows:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">

       <p>Buddhism traditionally incorporates states of meditative absorption (Pali: <i><!--del_lnk--> jh&#x101;na</i>; Skt: <i><!--del_lnk--> dhy&#x101;na</i>). The most ancient sustained expression of yogic ideas is found in the early sermons of the Buddha. One key innovative teaching of the Buddha was that meditative absorption must be combined with liberating cognition. The difference between the Buddha's teaching and the yoga presented in early Brahminic texts is striking. Meditative states alone are not an end, for according to the Buddha, even the highest meditative state is not liberating. Instead of attaining a complete cessation of thought, some sort of mental activity must take place: a liberating cognition, based on the practice of mindful awareness.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Meditation was an aspect of the practice of the <!--del_lnk--> yogis in the centuries preceding the Buddha. The Buddha built upon the yogis' concern with introspection and developed their meditative techniques, but rejected their theories of liberation. In Buddhism, <!--del_lnk--> mindfulness and <!--del_lnk--> clear awareness are to be developed at all times; in pre-Buddhist yogic practices there is no such injunction. A yogi in the Brahmanical tradition is not to practice while defecating, for example, while a Buddhist monastic should do so.</p>
       <p>Religious knowledge or "vision" was indicated as a result of practice both within and outside of the Buddhist fold. According to the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sama&ntilde;&ntilde;aphala Sutta</i>, this sort of vision arose for the Buddhist adept as a result of the perfection of "meditation" coupled with the perfection of "discipline" (Pali <i><!--del_lnk--> s&#x12B;la</i>; Skt. <i><!--del_lnk--> &#x15B;&#x12B;la</i>). Some of the Buddha's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day, but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of "transcendent wisdom" (Pali <i><!--del_lnk--> pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#x101;</i>; Skt. <i><!--del_lnk--> praj&ntilde;&#x101;</i>) was original.</p>
       <p>The Buddhist texts are probably the earliest describing meditation techniques. They describe meditative practices and states that existed before the Buddha as well as those first developed within Buddhism. Two Upanishads written after the rise of Buddhism do contain full-fledged descriptions of <!--del_lnk--> yoga as a means to liberation.</p>
       <p>While there is no convincing evidence for meditation in pre-Buddhist early Brahminic texts, Wynne argues that formless meditation originated in the Brahminic or Shramanic tradition, based on strong parallels between Upanishadic cosmological statements and the meditative goals of the two teachers of the Buddha as recorded in the early Buddhist texts. He mentions less likely possibilities as well. Having argued that the cosmological statements in the Upanishads also reflect a contemplative tradition, he argues that the <!--del_lnk--> Nasadiya Sukta contains evidence for a contemplative tradition, even as early as the late Rig Vedic period.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Traditionally, the first step in most Buddhist schools requires taking refuge in the Three Jewels (<a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>: <i>tri-ratna</i>, <!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li: <i>ti-ratana</i>) as the foundation of one's religious practice. The practice of taking refuge on behalf of young or even unborn children is mentioned in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Majjhima Nikaya</i>, recognized by most scholars as an early text (cf. <!--del_lnk--> Infant baptism). Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the <i><!--del_lnk--> lama</i>. In Mahayana, the person who chooses the <i><!--del_lnk--> bodhisattva</i> path makes a vow or pledge, considered the ultimate expression of compassion. In Mahayana, too, the Three Jewels are perceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging essence and as having an irreversible effect: "The Three Jewels have the quality of excellence. Just as real jewels never change their faculty and goodness, whether praised or reviled, so are the Three Jewels (Refuges), because they have an eternal and immutable essence. These Three Jewels bring a fruition that is changeless, for once one has reached Buddhahood, there is no possibility of falling back to suffering."</p>
       <p>The Three Jewels are:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>. This is a title for those who have attained Nirvana. See also the <!--del_lnk--> Tath&#x101;gata and <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>. The Buddha could also be represented as a concept instead of a specific person: the perfect wisdom that understands <i>Dharma</i> and sees reality in its true form. In Mahayana Buddhism, the Buddha can be viewed as the supreme Refuge: "Buddha is the Unique Absolute Refuge. Buddha is the Imperishable, Eternal, Indestructible and Absolute Refuge."</li>
        <li>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Dharma</i>. The teachings or law of nature as expounded by the Gautama Buddha. It can also, especially in Mahayana, connote the ultimate and sustaining Reality that is inseparable from the Buddha. Further, from some Mahayana perspectives, the Dharma embodied in the form of a great sutra (Buddhic scripture) can replace the need for a personal teacher and can be a direct and spontaneous gateway into Truth (Dharma). This is especially said to be the case with the <!--del_lnk--> Lotus Sutra. Dr. Hiroshi Kanno writes of this view of the <i>Lotus Sutra</i>: "it is a Dharma-gate of sudden enlightenment proper to the Great Vehicle; it is a Dharma-gate whereby one awakens spontaneously, without resorting to a teacher".</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Sangha</i>. Those who have attained to any of the <!--del_lnk--> Four stages of enlightenment, or simply the congregation of <!--del_lnk--> monastic practitioners.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>According to the scriptures, Gautama Buddha presented himself as a model. The Dharma offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of Nirvana. The Sangha is considered to provide a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable.</p>

       </div>
       <p><i><!--del_lnk--> &#x15A;&#x12B;la</i> (Sanskrit) or <i>s&#x12B;la</i> (P&#x101;li) is usually translated into English as "virtuous behaviour", "morality", "ethics" or "precept". It is an action committed through the body, speech, or mind, and involves an intentional effort. It is one of the <i>three practices</i> (<i>sila</i>, <i>samadhi</i>, and <i>panya</i>) and the second <i><!--del_lnk--> p&#x101;ramit&#x101;</i>. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of <i>&#x15B;&#x12B;la</i> are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment.</p>
       <p><i>&#x15A;&#x12B;la</i> is the foundation of <i>Samadhi/Bh&#x101;vana</i> (Meditative cultivation) or mind cultivation. Keeping the precepts promotes not only the peace of mind of the cultivator, which is internal, but also peace in the community, which is external. According to the Law of Karma, keeping the precepts are meritorious and it acts as causes that would bring about peaceful and happy effects. Keeping these precepts keeps the cultivator from rebirth in the four woeful realms of existence.</p>
       <p><i>&#x15A;&#x12B;la</i> refers to overall principles of ethical behaviour. There are several levels of <i>sila</i>, which correspond to "basic morality" (<!--del_lnk--> five precepts), "basic morality with asceticism" (<!--del_lnk--> eight precepts), "novice monkhood" (<!--del_lnk--> ten precepts) and "monkhood" (<i><a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">Vinaya</a></i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> Patimokkha</i>). Lay people generally undertake to live by the five precepts, which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the <!--del_lnk--> eight precepts, which add basic asceticism.</p>
       <p>The five precepts are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>To refrain from taking life (<!--del_lnk--> non-violence towards <!--del_lnk--> sentient life forms), or <i>ahims&#x101;</i>;</li>
        <li>To refrain from taking that which is not given (not committing <!--del_lnk--> theft);</li>
        <li>To refrain from sensual (including sexual) misconduct;</li>
        <li>To refrain from lying (speaking truth always);</li>
        <li>To refrain from intoxicants which lead to loss of <!--del_lnk--> mindfulness (specifically, drugs and alcohol).</li>
       </ol>
       <p>The precepts are not formulated as imperatives, but as training rules that laypeople undertake voluntarily to facilitate practice. In Buddhist thought, the cultivation of <!--del_lnk--> dana and ethical conduct themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower heavens is likely, even if there is no further Buddhist practice. There is nothing improper or un-Buddhist about limiting one's aims to this level of attainment.</p>
       <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of <!--del_lnk--> celibacy. The three additional precepts are:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (eat only from sunrise to noon);</dd>
        <dd>7. To refrain from dancing and playing music, wearing jewelry and cosmetics, attending shows and other performances;</dd>
        <dd>8. To refrain from using high or luxurious seats and bedding.</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>The complete list of ten precepts may be observed by laypeople for short periods. For the complete list, the seventh precept is partitioned into two, and a tenth added:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>6. To refrain from taking food at an unseasonable time, that is after the mid-day meal;</dd>
        <dd>7. To refrain from dancing, music, singing and unseemly shows;</dd>
        <dd>8. To refrain from the use of garlands, perfumes, ointments, and from things that tend to beautify and adorn (the person);</dd>
        <dd>9. To refrain from (using) high and luxurious seats (and beds);</dd>
        <dd>10. To refrain from accepting gold and silver;</dd>

       <p><a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">Vinaya</a> is the specific moral code for monks and nuns. It includes the <!--del_lnk--> Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules for monks in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the <!--del_lnk--> vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differs slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. <!--del_lnk--> Novice-monks use the <!--del_lnk--> ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.</p>
       <p>Regarding the monastic rules, the Buddha constantly reminds his hearers that it is the spirit that counts. On the other hand, the rules themselves are designed to assure a satisfying life, and provide a perfect springboard for the higher attainments. Monastics are instructed by the Buddha to live as "islands unto themselves". In this sense, living life as the vinaya prescribes it is, as one scholar puts it: "more than merely a means to an end: it is very nearly the end in itself."</p>
       <p>In Eastern Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana <!--del_lnk--> Brahmajala Sutra (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for <!--del_lnk--> Bodhisattvas, where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and <!--del_lnk--> vegetarianism is actively encouraged (see <i><!--del_lnk--> vegetarianism in Buddhism</i>). In Japan, this has almost completely displaced the monastic vinaya, and allows clergy to marry.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Buddhist meditation is fundamentally concerned with two themes: transforming the mind and using it to explore itself and other phenomena. According to Theravada Buddhism the Buddha taught two types of meditation, <!--del_lnk--> <i>samatha</i> meditation (Sanskrit: <i>&#x15B;amatha</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> <i>vipassan&#x101;</i> meditation (Sanskrit: <i>vipa&#x15B;yan&#x101;</i>). In Chinese Buddhism, these exist (translated <i>chih kuan</i>), but <!--del_lnk--> Ch&aacute;n (Zen) meditation is more popular. According to Peter Harvey, whenever Buddhism has been healthy, not only monks, nuns, and married lamas, but also more committed lay people have practiced meditation. According to Routledge's Encyclopedia of Buddhism, in contrast, throughout most of Buddhist history before modern times, serious meditation by lay people has been unusual. The evidence of the early texts suggests that at the time of the Buddha, many male and female lay practitioners did practice meditation, some even to the point of proficiency in all eight <!--del_lnk--> jh&#x101;nas (see the next section regarding these).</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sam.C4.81dhi_.28meditative_cultivation.29:_samatha_meditation">Sam&#x101;dhi (meditative cultivation): samatha meditation</span></h4>
       <p>In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, <i>samyaksam&#x101;dhi</i> is "right concentration". The primary means of cultivating <i>sam&#x101;dhi</i> is meditation. Upon development of <i>sam&#x101;dhi</i>, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous.</p>
       <p>Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (<i><!--del_lnk--> jh&#x101;na</i>, Sanskrit &#x927;&#x94D;&#x92F;&#x93E;&#x928; <i>dhy&#x101;na</i>), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (<!--del_lnk--> vipassan&#x101;) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of <!--del_lnk--> mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Samatha meditation starts from being mindful of an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (<i>jh&#x101;na</i>) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath (<!--del_lnk--> anapanasati), because this practice can lead to both <i>samatha</i> and <i>vipassana'.</i></p>
       <p>In Buddhist practice, it is said that while <i>samatha</i> meditation can calm the mind, only <i>vipassan&#x101;</i> meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to knowledge (<i><!--del_lnk--> j&ntilde;&#x101;na</i>; P&#x101;li <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">&ntilde;&#x101;&#x1E47;a</span></i>) and understanding (<i><!--del_lnk--> praj&ntilde;&#x101;</i> P&#x101;li <i>pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#x101;</i>), and thus can lead to <i>nirv&#x101;&#x1E47;a</i> (P&#x101;li <i>nibb&#x101;na</i>). When one is in jhana, all defilements are suppressed temporarily. Only understanding (<i>praj&ntilde;&#x101;</i> or <i>vipassana</i>) eradicates the defilements completely. Jhanas are also states that <i><!--del_lnk--> Arahants</i> abide in order to rest.</p>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="In_Therav.C4.81da">In Therav&#x101;da</span></h5>
       <p>In Therav&#x101;da Buddhism, the cause of human existence and suffering is identified as craving, which carries with it the various defilements. These various defilements are traditionally summed up as greed, hatred and delusion. These are believed deeply rooted afflictions of the mind that create suffering and stress. To be free from suffering and stress, these defilements must be permanently uprooted through internal investigation, analyzing, experiencing, and understanding of the true nature of those defilements by using <i>jh&#x101;na</i>, a technique of the Noble Eightfold Path. It then leads the meditator to realize the Four Noble Truths, Enlightenment and <i><!--del_lnk--> Nibbana</i>. Nibbana is the ultimate goal of Theravadins.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Praj.C3.B1.C4.81_.28Wisdom.29:_vipassana_meditation">Praj&ntilde;&#x101; (Wisdom): vipassana meditation</span></h4>
       <p><i>Praj&ntilde;&#x101;</i> (Sanskrit) or <i>pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#x101;</i> (P&#x101;li) means wisdom that is based on a realization of <!--del_lnk--> dependent origination, The Four Noble Truths and the <!--del_lnk--> three marks of existence. <i>Praj&ntilde;&#x101;</i> is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about <i>bodhi</i>. It is spoken of as the principal means of attaining <i><span class="Unicode">nirv&#x101;&#x1E47;a</span></i>, through its revelation of the true nature of all things as <i><!--del_lnk--> dukkha</i> (unsatisfactoriness), <i><!--del_lnk--> anicca</i> (impermanence) and <i><!--del_lnk--> anatta</i> (not-self). <i>Praj&ntilde;&#x101;</i> is also listed as the sixth of the six <i><!--del_lnk--> p&#x101;ramit&#x101;s</i> of the Mahayana.</p>
       <p>Initially, <i>praj&ntilde;&#x101;</i> is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading, studying, and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Notably, one could in theory attain Nirvana at any point of practice, whether deep in meditation, listening to a sermon, conducting the business of one's daily life, or any other activity.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Zen">Zen</span></h4>
       <p>Zen Buddhism (&#x7985;), pronounced <!--del_lnk--> <i>Ch&aacute;n</i> in Chinese, <i>seon</i> in Korean or <i>zen</i> in Japanese (derived from the Sanskrit term <i>dhy&#x101;na</i>, meaning "meditation") is a form of Buddhism that became popular in China, Korea and Japan and that lays special emphasis on meditation. Zen places less emphasis on scriptures than some other forms of Buddhism and prefers to focus on direct spiritual breakthroughs to truth.</p>
       <p>Zen Buddhism is divided into two main schools: <!--del_lnk--> Rinzai (&#x81E8;&#x6E08;&#x5B97;) and <!--del_lnk--> S&#x14D;t&#x14D; (&#x66F9;&#x6D1E;&#x5B97;), the former greatly favouring the use in meditation on the <!--del_lnk--> koan (&#x516C;&#x6848;, a meditative riddle or puzzle) as a device for spiritual break-through, and the latter (while certainly employing koans) focusing more on <i><!--del_lnk--> shikantaza</i> or "just sitting".</p>
       <p>Zen Buddhist teaching is often full of paradox, in order to loosen the grip of the ego and to facilitate the penetration into the realm of the True Self or Formless Self, which is equated with the Buddha himself. According to Zen master Kosho Uchiyama, when thoughts and fixation on the little "I" are transcended, an Awakening to a universal, non-dual Self occurs: "When we let go of thoughts and wake up to the reality of life that is working beyond them, we discover the Self that is living universal non-dual life (before the separation into two) that pervades all living creatures and all existence." Thinking and thought must therefore not be allowed to confine and bind one.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vajrayana_and_Tantra">Vajrayana and Tantra</span></h4>
       <p>Though based upon Mahayana, Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhism is one of the schools that practice <i><!--del_lnk--> Vajrayana</i> or "Diamond Vehicle" (also referred to as Mantray&#x101;na, Tantray&#x101;na, <!--del_lnk--> Tantric Buddhism, or <!--del_lnk--> esoteric Buddhism). It accepts all the basic concepts of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na, but also includes a vast array of spiritual and physical techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Tantric Buddhism is largely concerned with ritual and meditative practices. One component of the Vajray&#x101;na is harnessing psycho-physical energy through ritual, visualization, physical exercises, and meditation as a means of developing the mind. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In the Tibetan tradition, these practices can include <!--del_lnk--> sexual yoga, though only for some very advanced practitioners.</p>

       <p>Historically, the roots of Buddhism lie in the religious thought of <!--del_lnk--> ancient India during the second half of the first millennium BCE. That was a period of social and religious turmoil, as there was significant discontent with the sacrifices and rituals of <!--del_lnk--> Vedic Brahmanism. It was challenged by numerous new <!--del_lnk--> ascetic religious and philosophical groups and teachings that broke with the Brahmanic tradition and rejected the authority of the <!--del_lnk--> Vedas and the <!--del_lnk--> Brahmans. These groups, whose members were known as <!--del_lnk--> shramanas, were a continuation of a non-Vedic strand of Indian thought distinct from Indo-Aryan Brahmanism. Scholars have reasons to believe that ideas such as samsara, karma (in the sense of the influence of morality on rebirth), and <!--del_lnk--> moksha originated in the shramanas, and were later adopted by <!--del_lnk--> Brahmin orthodoxy.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>This view is supported by a study of the region where these notions originated. Buddhism arose in Greater <!--del_lnk--> Magadha, which stretched from <!--del_lnk--> Sravasti, the capital of Kosala in the north-west, to <!--del_lnk--> Rajagrha in the south east. This land, to the east of <!--del_lnk--> aryavarta, the land of the Aryas, was recognised as non-Vedic. Other Vedic texts reveal a dislike of the people of Magadha, in all probability because the Magadhas at this time were not Brahmanised. It was not until the 2nd or 3rd centuries BCE that the eastward spread of Brahmanism into Greater Magadha became significant. Ideas that developed in Greater Magadha prior to this were not subject to Vedic influence. These include rebirth and karmic retribution that appear in a number of movements in Greater Magadha, including Buddhism. These movements inherited notions of rebirth and karmic retribution from an earlier culture.</p>

       <p>At the same time, these movements were influenced by, and in some respects continued, philosophical thought within the Vedic tradition as reflected e.g. in the <!--del_lnk--> Upanishads. These movements included, besides Buddhism, various <!--del_lnk--> skeptics (such as <!--del_lnk--> Sanjaya Belatthiputta), <!--del_lnk--> atomists (such as <!--del_lnk--> Pakudha Kaccayana), <!--del_lnk--> materialists (such as <!--del_lnk--> Ajita Kesakambali), <!--del_lnk--> antinomians (such as <!--del_lnk--> Purana Kassapa); the most important ones in the 5th century BCE were the <!--del_lnk--> Ajivikas, who emphasized the rule of fate, the <!--del_lnk--> Lokayata (<!--del_lnk--> materialists), the <!--del_lnk--> Ajnanas (<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Agnosticism.htm" title="Agnostics">agnostics</a>) and the <!--del_lnk--> Jains, who stressed that the soul must be freed from matter.</p>
       <p>Many of these new movements shared the same conceptual vocabulary - <!--del_lnk--> atman ("Self"), <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">buddha</a> ("awakened one"), <!--del_lnk--> dhamma ("rule" or "law"), <!--del_lnk--> karma ("action"), <!--del_lnk--> nirvana ("extinguishing"), <!--del_lnk--> samsara ("eternal recurrence") and <!--del_lnk--> yoga ("spiritual practice"). The shramanas rejected the Veda, and the authority of the brahmans, who claimed they possessed revealed truths not knowable by any ordinary human means. Moreover, they declared that the entire Brahmanical system was fraudulent: a conspiracy of the brahmans to enrich themselves by charging exorbitant fees to perform bogus rites and give useless advice.</p>
       <p>A particular criticism of the Buddha was Vedic animal sacrifice. The Buddha declared that priests reciting the Vedas were like the blind leading the blind. According to him, those priests who had memorized the Vedas really knew nothing. He also mocked the Vedic "<!--del_lnk--> hymn of the cosmic man". However, the Buddha was not anti-Vedic, and declared that the Veda in its true form was declared by "Kashyapa" to certain rishis, who by severe penances had acquired the power to see by divine eyes. He names the Vedic rishis, and declared that the original Veda of the rishis was altered by a few Brahmins who introduced animal sacrifices. The Buddha says that it was on this alteration of the true Veda that he refused to pay respect to the Vedas of his time. He declared that the primary goal of Upanishadic thought, the <!--del_lnk--> Atman, was in fact non-existent, and, having explained that Brahminical attempts to achieve liberation at death were futile, proposed his new idea of liberation in life. However, he did not denounce the union with Brahman, or the idea of the self uniting with the Self. At the same time, the traditional Brahminical religion itself gradually underwent profound changes, transforming it into what is recognized as early <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>. In particular, the brahmans thus developed "philosophical systems of their own, meeting the new ideas with adaptations of their doctrines".</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Indian_Buddhism">Indian Buddhism</span></h3>
       <p>The history of Indian Buddhism may be divided into five periods: Early Buddhism (occasionally called <!--del_lnk--> Pre-sectarian Buddhism), <!--del_lnk--> Nikaya Buddhism or Sectarian Buddhism: The period of the <!--del_lnk--> Early Buddhist schools, Early <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhism, Later Mahayana Buddhism, and Esoteric Buddhism (also called <!--del_lnk--> Vajrayana Buddhism).</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pre-sectarian_Buddhism">Pre-sectarian Buddhism</span></h4>
       <p>Pre-sectarian Buddhism is the earliest phase of Buddhism, recognized by nearly all scholars. Its main scriptures are the <!--del_lnk--> Vinaya Pitaka and the four principal <!--del_lnk--> Nikayas or <!--del_lnk--> Agamas. Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, so most scholars conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the <!--del_lnk--> Three marks of existence, the <!--del_lnk--> Five Aggregates, <!--del_lnk--> Dependent origination, <!--del_lnk--> Karma and <!--del_lnk--> Rebirth, the <!--del_lnk--> Four Noble Truths, the <!--del_lnk--> Noble Eightfold Path, and <!--del_lnk--> Nirvana. Some scholars disagree, and have proposed many other theories.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>According to the scriptures, soon after the <!--del_lnk--> <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">parinirv&#x101;&#x1E47;a</span> (from Sanskrit: "highest extinguishment") of Gautama Buddha, the <!--del_lnk--> first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission. In the first council, <!--del_lnk--> &#x100;nanda, a cousin of the Buddha and his personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses (<i>s&#x16B;tras</i>, P&#x101;li <i>sutta</i>s) of the Buddha, and, according to some sources, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Abhidhamma_Pitaka.htm" title="Abhidhamma">abhidhamma</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Up&#x101;li, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (<i><a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">vinaya</a></i>). Scholars regard the traditional accounts of the council as greatly exaggerated if not entirely fictitious.</p>
       <p>According to most scholars, at some period after the Second Council the <i>Sangha</i> began to break into separate factions. The various accounts differ as to when the actual schisms occurred. According to the <i><!--del_lnk--> Dipavamsa</i> of the P&#x101;li tradition, they started immediately after the Second Council, the Puggalavada tradition places it in 137 AN, the <!--del_lnk--> Sarvastivada tradition of <!--del_lnk--> Vasumitra says it was in the time of Asoka and the <!--del_lnk--> Mahasanghika tradition places it much later, nearly 100 BCE.</p>
       <p>The root schism was between the <!--del_lnk--> Sthaviras and the <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;s&#x101;&#x1E45;ghikas. The fortunate survival of accounts from both sides of the dispute reveals disparate traditions. The Sthavira group offers two quite distinct reasons for the schism. The Dipavamsa of the Therav&#x101;da says that the losing party in the Second Council dispute broke away in protest and formed the Mahasanghika. This contradicts the Mahasanghikas' own <i>vinaya</i>, which shows them as on the same, winning side. The Mah&#x101;s&#x101;&#x1E45;ghikas argued that the Sthaviras were trying to expand the <i>vinaya</i> and may also have challenged what they perceived were excessive claims or inhumanly high criteria for <!--del_lnk--> arhatship. Both parties, therefore, appealed to tradition.</p>
       <p>The Sthaviras gave rise to several schools, one of which was the <!--del_lnk--> Therav&#x101;da school. Originally, these schisms were caused by disputes over vinaya, and monks following different schools of thought seem to have lived happily together in the same monasteries, but eventually, by about 100 CE if not earlier, schisms were being caused by doctrinal disagreements too.</p>
       <p>Following (or leading up to) the schisms, each Sa&#x1E45;gha started to accumulate an <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Abhidhamma_Pitaka.htm" title="Abhidhamma">Abhidharma</a>, a detailed scholastic reworking of doctrinal material appearing in the <!--del_lnk--> Suttas, according to schematic classifications. These Abhidharma texts do not contain systematic philosophical treatises, but summaries or numerical lists. Scholars generally date these texts to around the 3rd century BCE, 100 to 200 years after the death of the Buddha. Therefore the seven Abhidharma works are generally claimed not to represent the words of the Buddha himself, but those of disciples and great scholars. Every school had its own version of the Adhidharma, with different theories and different texts. The different Adhidharmas of the various schools did not agree with each other. Scholars disagree on whether the Mahasanghika school had an Abhidhamma Pitaka or not.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The origins of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na, which formed between 100 BCE and 100 AD, are still not completely understood. The earliest views of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhism in the West assumed that it existed as a separate school in competition with the so-called "<!--del_lnk--> H&#x12B;nay&#x101;na" schools. The split was on the order of the European <!--del_lnk--> Protestant Reformation, which divided Christians into <a href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Catholic Church">Catholic</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Protestant. Due to the veneration of buddhas and bodhisattvas, Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na was often interpreted as a more devotional, lay-inspired form of Buddhism, with supposed origins in <!--del_lnk--> st&#x16B;pa veneration. The old views of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na as a lay-inspired sect are now largely considered misguided and wrong.</p>
       <p>There is no evidence that Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as <i>Bodhisattvay&#x101;na</i> (the "Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na never had nor ever attempted to have a separate <a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">Vinaya</a> or ordination lineage from the <!--del_lnk--> early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhik&#x1E63;u or bhik&#x1E63;u&#x1E47;&#x12B; adhering to the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the <!--del_lnk--> Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the <!--del_lnk--> M&#x16B;lasarv&#x101;stiv&#x101;da ordination lineage in <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na and non-Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.</p>

       <p>The Chinese monk <!--del_lnk--> Yijing who visited India in the 7th century CE, distinguishes Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na from H&#x12B;nay&#x101;na as follows:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">Both adopt one and the same Vinaya, and they have in common the prohibitions of the five offences, and also the practice of the <!--del_lnk--> Four Noble Truths. Those who venerate the bodhisattvas and read the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na s&#x16B;tras are called the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;nists, while those who do not perform these are called the H&#x12B;nay&#x101;nists.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na comes from early Chinese translations of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na texts. These Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na teachings were first propagated into <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Lokak&#x1E63;ema, the first translator of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na s&#x16B;tras into <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> during the 2nd century CE. Some scholars have traditionally considered the earliest Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na s&#x16B;tras to include the very first versions of the <!--del_lnk--> Praj&ntilde;&#x101;p&#x101;ramit&#x101; series, along with texts concerning <!--del_lnk--> Ak&#x1E63;obhya Buddha, which were probably composed in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Late_Mahayana_Buddhism">Late Mahayana Buddhism</span></h4>
       <p>During the period of Late Mahayana Buddhism, four major types of thought developed: <!--del_lnk--> Madhyamaka, <!--del_lnk--> Yogacara, <!--del_lnk--> Tathagatagarbha, and <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist Logic as the last and most recent. In India, the two main philosophical schools of the Mahayana were the Madhyamaka and the later Yogacara. According to Dan Lusthaus, Madhyamaka and Yogacara have a great deal in common, and the commonality stems from early Buddhism. There were no great Indian teachers associated with tathagatagarbha thought.</p>

       <p>Buddhism may have spread only slowly in India until the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan emperor <!--del_lnk--> Ashoka, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of A&#x15B;oka and his descendants led to the construction of more <!--del_lnk--> st&#x16B;pas (Buddhist religious memorials) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands&mdash;particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Therav&#x101;da Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia.</p>
       <p>This period marks the first known spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the <!--del_lnk--> edicts of A&#x15B;oka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India to spread Buddhism (Dharma), particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Seleucid Empire, and even farther to <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. It is a matter of disagreement among scholars whether or not these emissaries were accompanied by Buddhist missionaries.</p>
       <p>The gradual spread of Buddhism into adjacent areas meant that it came into contact with new ethnical groups. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, to changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions&mdash;themselves influenced by Buddhism. Striking examples of this syncretistic development can be seen in the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Greek Kingdom, and in the development of the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Buddhist art of <!--del_lnk--> Gandh&#x101;ra. A Greek king, <!--del_lnk--> Menander, has even been immortalized in the Buddhist canon.</p>
       <p>The Theravada school spread south from India in the 3rd century BCE, to Sri Lanka and <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Burma.htm" title="Burma">Burma</a> and later also <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. The Dharmagupta school spread (also in 3rd century BCE) north to <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>, Gandhara and Bactria (Afghanistan).</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road transmission of Buddhism to <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> is most commonly thought to have started in the late 2nd or the 1st century CE, though the literary sources are all open to question. The first documented translation efforts by foreign <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist monks in China were in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the <!--del_lnk--> Kushan Empire into the Chinese territory of the <!--del_lnk--> Tarim Basin.</p>
       <p>In the 2nd century CE, Mahayana Sutras spread to China, and then to Korea and Japan, and were translated into Chinese. During the Indian period of Esoteric Buddhism (from the 8th century onwards), Buddhism spread from India to Tibet and <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>.</p>

       <p>By the late Middle Ages, Buddhism had become virtually extinct in India, and although it continued to exist in surrounding countries, its influence was no longer expanding. It is now again gaining strength worldwide. Estimates of the number of Buddhist followers by scholars range from 550 million to 1.691 billion. Most scholars classify similar numbers of people under a category they call "Chinese folk" or "traditional" religion, an amalgam of various traditions that includes Buddhism.</p>
       <p>Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The <!--del_lnk--> Three Jewels: the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a></i>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Dharma</i> (the teachings of the Buddha), and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sangha</i> (the Buddhist community).</p>
       <p>Estimates are uncertain for several reasons:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>difficulties in defining who counts as a Buddhist;</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> syncretism among the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern religions. Buddhism is practiced by adherents alongside many other religious traditions- including <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Shinto.htm" title="Shinto">Shinto</a>, <!--del_lnk--> traditional religions, <!--del_lnk--> shamanism, and <!--del_lnk--> animism- throughout East and Southeast Asia.</li>
        <li>difficulties in estimating the number of Buddhists who do not have congregational memberships and often do not participate in public ceremonies;</li>
        <li>official policies on religion in several historically Buddhist countries that make accurate assessments of religious adherence more difficult; most notably <!--del_lnk--> China, <!--del_lnk--> Vietnam and <!--del_lnk--> North Korea. In many current and former Communist governments in Asia, government policies may discourage adherents from reporting their religious identity, or may encourage official counts to underestimate religious adherence.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>China and India are now starting to fund Buddhist shrines in various Asian countries as they compete for influence in the region.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Late_20th_Century_Buddhist_Movements">Late 20th Century Buddhist Movements</span></h3>
       <p>A number of modern movements or tendencies in Buddhism emerged during the second half of the 20th Century, including the <!--del_lnk--> Dalit Buddhist movement (also sometimes called 'neo-Buddhism'), <!--del_lnk--> Engaged Buddhism, and the further development of various <!--del_lnk--> Western Buddhist traditions.</p>

       <p>Buddhists generally classify themselves as either <!--del_lnk--> Theravada or <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana. This classification is also used by some scholars and is the one ordinarily used in the English language. An alternative scheme used by some scholars divides Buddhism into the following three traditions or geographical or cultural areas: <!--del_lnk--> Theravada, <!--del_lnk--> East Asian Buddhism and <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
       <p>Some scholars use other schemes. Buddhists themselves have a variety of other schemes. <!--del_lnk--> Hinayana (literally "lesser vehicle") is used by Mahayana followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary Theravada emerged, but as this term is rooted in the Mahayana viewpoint and can be considered derogatory, a variety of other terms are increasingly used instead, including <!--del_lnk--> &#x15A;r&#x101;vakay&#x101;na, Nikaya Buddhism, early Buddhist schools, sectarian Buddhism, conservative Buddhism, mainstream Buddhism and non-Mahayana Buddhism.</p>
       <p>Not all traditions of Buddhism share the same philosophical outlook, or treat the same concepts as central. Each tradition, however, does have its own core concepts, and some comparisons can be drawn between them. For example, according to one Buddhist ecumenical organization, several <!--del_lnk--> concepts common to both major Buddhist branches:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Both accept <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">the Buddha</a> as their teacher.</li>
        <li>Both accept the <!--del_lnk--> Middle way, <!--del_lnk--> Dependent origination, the <!--del_lnk--> Four Noble Truths, the <!--del_lnk--> Noble Eightfold Path and the <!--del_lnk--> Three marks of existence.</li>
        <li>Both accept that members of the laity and of the <!--del_lnk--> sangha can pursue the path toward enlightenment (<!--del_lnk--> bodhi).</li>
        <li>Both consider buddhahood the highest attainment.</li>
       </ul>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Theravada_school">Theravada school</span></h3>
       <p>Theravada ("Doctrine of the Elders", or "Ancient Doctrine") is the oldest surviving Buddhist school. It is relatively conservative, and <i>generally</i> closest to early Buddhism. This school is derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Vibhajjav&#x101;da grouping that emerged amongst the older <!--del_lnk--> Sthavira group at the time of the Third Buddhist Council (c. 250 BCE). This school gradually declined on the Indian subcontinent, but its branch in Sri Lanka and South East Asia continues to survive.</p>
       <p>The Theravada school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/P%25C4%2581li_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">P&#x101;li Canon</a> and its commentaries. After being orally transmitted for a few centuries, its scriptures, the Pali Canon, were finally committed to writing in the 1st century BCE, in Sri Lanka, at what the Theravada usually reckon as the fourth council. It is also one of the first Buddhist schools to commit the complete set of its canon into writing. The <!--del_lnk--> Sutta collections and <a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">Vinaya</a> texts of the P&#x101;li Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tripi%25E1%25B9%25ADaka.htm" title="Tripitaka">Tripitaka</a>), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.</p>
       <p>Therav&#x101;da is primarily practiced today in <!--del_lnk--> Sri Lanka, <!--del_lnk--> Burma, <!--del_lnk--> Laos, <!--del_lnk--> Thailand, <!--del_lnk--> Cambodia as well as small portions of China, <!--del_lnk--> Vietnam, <!--del_lnk--> Malaysia and <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.</p>
       <p>Theravadin Buddhists think that personal effort is required to realize rebirth. Meditation is done by forest monks for the most part, while village monks teach and serve their lay communities. Laypersons can perform good actions, producing merit that can be traded to the gods who may reward it with material benefits.</p>

       <p>Mahayana Buddhism flourished in India from the 5th century CE onwards, during the dynasty of the <!--del_lnk--> Guptas. Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na centres of learning were established, the most important one being the <!--del_lnk--> N&#x101;land&#x101; University in north-eastern India.</p>
       <p>Mahayana schools recognize all or part of the <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Sutras. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself, and faith in and veneration of those texts are stated in some sutras (e.g. the <!--del_lnk--> Lotus Sutra and the <!--del_lnk--> Mahaparinirvana Sutra) to lay the foundations for the later attainment of Buddhahood itself.</p>

The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahayana in origin, but is discussed below under the heading of Vajrayana (also commonly referred to as "Northern Buddhism". There are a variety of strands in Eastern Buddhism, of which "the Pure Land school of Mahayana is the most widely practised today.". In most of this area however, they are fused into a single unified form of Buddhism. <!--del_lnk--> In Japan in particular, they form separate denominations with the five major ones being: <!--del_lnk--> Nichiren, peculiar to Japan; <!--del_lnk--> Pure Land; <!--del_lnk--> Shingon, a form of Vajrayana; <!--del_lnk--> Tendai, and <!--del_lnk--> Zen.

       <p>The Vajrayana tradition of Buddhism spread to China, Mongolia, and Tibet. In Tibet, Vajrayana has always been a main component of Tibetan Buddhism, while in China it formed a separate sect. However, Vajrayana Buddhism became extinct in China but survived in elements of Japan's Shingon and Tendai sects.</p>
       <p>There are differing views as to just when Vajray&#x101;na and its <!--del_lnk--> tantric practice started. In the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical &#x15A;&#x101;kyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were passed on orally first and only written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. <!--del_lnk--> N&#x101;land&#x101; University became a centre for the development of Vajray&#x101;na theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajray&#x101;na practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theories were transmitted to China, <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism (Vajray&#x101;na) stems from the late (9th&ndash;12th century) N&#x101;land&#x101; tradition.</p>
       <p>In one of the first major contemporary academic treatises on the subject, <!--del_lnk--> Fairfield University professor Ronald M. Davidson argues that the rise of Vajrayana was in part a reaction to the changing political climate in India at the time. With the fall of the <!--del_lnk--> Gupta dynasty, in an increasingly fractious political environment, institutional Buddhism had difficulty attracting patronage, and the folk movement led by <!--del_lnk--> siddhas became more prominent. After perhaps two hundred years, it had begun to get integrated into the monastic establishment.</p>
       <p>Vajrayana combined and developed a variety of elements, a number of which had already existed for centuries. In addition to the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na scriptures, Vajray&#x101;na Buddhists recognise a large body of <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist Tantras, some of which are also included in Chinese and Japanese collections of Buddhist literature, and versions of a few even in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/P%25C4%2581li_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a>.</p>

       <p>Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on learning the various texts. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. Buddhist scriptures are mainly written in <!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li, <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan, <!--del_lnk--> Mongolian, and <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>. Some texts still exist in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit.</p>
       <p>Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. However, some scholars have referred to the <!--del_lnk--> Vinaya Pitaka and the first four Nikayas of the <!--del_lnk--> Sutta Pitaka as the common core of all Buddhist traditions. This could be considered misleading, as Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na considers these merely a preliminary, and not a core, teaching. The Tibetan Buddhists have not even translated most of the &#x101;gamas (though theoretically they recognize them) and they play no part in the religious life of either clergy or laity in China and Japan. Other scholars say there is no universally accepted common core. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer <!--del_lnk--> Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy.</p>
       <p>The followers of Therav&#x101;da Buddhism take the scriptures known as the P&#x101;li Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na s&#x16B;tras and their own <i>vinaya</i>. The P&#x101;li sutras, along with other, closely related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the <i><!--del_lnk--> &#x101;gamas</i>.</p>
       <p>Over the years, various attempts have been made to synthesize a single Buddhist text that can encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture.</p>
       <p>Dwight Goddard collected a sample of Buddhist scriptures, with the emphasis on Zen, along with other classics of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern philosophy, such as the <a href="../../wp/t/Tao_Te_Ching.htm" title="Tao Te Ching">Tao Te Ching</a>, into his 'Buddhist Bible' in the 1920s. More recently, Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles in <!--del_lnk--> "The Buddha and His Dhamma". Other such efforts have persisted to present day, but currently there is no single text that represents all Buddhist traditions.</p>

       <p>The P&#x101;li Tipitaka, which means "three baskets", refers to the <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>, the <i>Sutta Pitaka</i>, and the <i>Abhidhamma Pitaka</i>. The <i><a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">Vinaya Pitaka</a></i> contains disciplinary rules for the Buddhist <a href="../../wp/m/Monk.htm" title="Monk">monks</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Nun.htm" title="Nun">nuns</a>, as well as explanations of why and how these rules were instituted, supporting material, and doctrinal clarification. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Sutta Pitaka</i> contains discourses ascribed to <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>. The <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Abhidhamma_Pitaka.htm" title="Abhidhamma">Abhidhamma Pitaka</a></i> contains material often described as systematic expositions of the Gautama Buddha's teachings.</p>
       <p>The P&#x101;li Tipitaka is the only early Tipitaka (Sanskrit: <i>Tripi&#x1E6D;aka</i>) to survive intact in its original language, but a number of early schools had their own recensions of the Tipitaka featuring much of the same material. We have portions of the Tipitakas of the S&#x101;rv&#x101;stiv&#x101;da, Dharmaguptaka, Sammitya, Mah&#x101;sa&#x1E45;ghika, K&#x101;&#x15B;yap&#x12B;ya, and Mah&#x12B;&#x15B;&#x101;saka schools, most of which survive in Chinese translation only. According to some sources, some early schools of Buddhism had five or seven pitakas.</p>
       <p>According to the scriptures, soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;k&#x101;&#x15B;yapa (P&#x101;li: Mah&#x101;kassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's teachings. <!--del_lnk--> Up&#x101;li recited the <i>vinaya</i>. <!--del_lnk--> &#x100;nanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the dhamma. These became the basis of the Tripitaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in the last century BCE. Both the s&#x16B;tras and the <i>vinaya</i> of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Gautama Buddha's previous lives, and various other subjects.</p>
       <p>Much of the material in the Canon is not specifically "Theravadin", but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey, it contains material at odds with later Theravadin orthodoxy. He states: "The Theravadins, then, may have <i>added</i> texts to the Canon for some time, but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period."</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana sutras are a very broad genre of Buddhist scriptures that the <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">the Buddha</a>. Some adherents of Mahayana accept both the early teachings (including in this the Sarvastivada Abhidharma, which was criticized by Nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early Buddhist thought) and the Mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of Gautama Buddha, and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding.</p>
       <p>The Mahayana sutras often claim to articulate the Buddha's deeper, more advanced doctrines, reserved for those who follow the <!--del_lnk--> bodhisattva path. That path is explained as being built upon the motivation to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name <i>Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na</i> (lit., <i>the Great Vehicle</i>).</p>
       <p>According to Mahayana tradition, the Mahayana sutras were transmitted in secret, came from other Buddhas or <!--del_lnk--> Bodhisattvas, or were preserved in non-human worlds because human beings at the time could not understand them:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">Some of our sources maintain the authenticity of certain other texts not found in the canons of these schools (the early schools). These texts are those held genuine by the later school, not one of the eighteen, which arrogated to itself the title of Mahayana, 'Great Vehicle'. According to the Mahayana historians these texts were admittedly unknown to the early schools of Buddhists. However, they had all been promulgated by the Buddha. [The Buddha's] followers on earth, the sravakas ('pupils'), had not been sufficiently advanced to understand them, and hence were not given them to remember, but they were taught to various supernatural beings and then preserved in such places as the Dragon World.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Approximately six hundred Mahayana sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan translations. In addition, East Asian Buddhism recognizes some sutras regarded by scholars as of Chinese rather than Indian origin.</p>
       <p>Generally, scholars conclude that the Mahayana scriptures were composed from the 1st century CE onwards: "Large numbers of Mahayana sutras were being composed in the period between the beginning of the common era and the fifth century", five centuries after the historical <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>. Some of these had their roots in other scriptures composed in the 1st century BCE. It was not until after the 5th century CE that the Mahayana sutras started to influence the behavior of mainstream Buddhists in India: "But outside of texts, at least in India, at exactly the same period, very different&mdash;in fact seemingly older&mdash;ideas and aspirations appear to be motivating actual behaviour, and old and established Hinnayana groups appear to be the only ones that are patronized and supported." These texts were apparently not universally accepted among Indian Buddhists when they appeared; the pejorative label <i><!--del_lnk--> hinayana</i> was applied by Mahayana supporters to those who rejected the Mahayana sutras.</p>
       <p>Only the Theravada school does not include the Mahayana scriptures in its canon. As the modern Theravada school is descended from a branch of Buddhism that diverged and established itself in Sri Lanka prior to the emergence of the Mahayana texts, debate exists as to whether the Theravada were historically included in the <i>hinayana</i> designation; in the modern era, this label is seen as derogatory, and is generally avoided.</p>
       <p>Scholar Isabelle Onians asserts that although "the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na ... very occasionally referred contemptuously to earlier Buddhism as the Hinay&#x101;na, the Inferior Way," "the preponderance of this name in the secondary literature is far out of proportion to occurrences in the Indian texts." She notes that the term <!--del_lnk--> &#x15A;r&#x101;vakay&#x101;na was "the more politically correct and much more usual" term used by Mah&#x101;y&#x101;nists. Jonathan Silk has argued that the term "Hinayana" was used to refer to whomever one wanted to criticize on any given occasion, and did not refer to any definite grouping of Buddhists.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparative_studies">Comparative studies</span></h2>
       <p>Buddhism provides many opportunities for comparative study with a diverse range of subjects. For example, Buddhism's emphasis on the <!--del_lnk--> Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various differing beliefs, customs and institutions in countries where it has resided throughout its history. Also, its moral and spiritual parallels with other systems of thought&mdash;for example, with various tenets of Christianity&mdash;have been subjects of close study. In addition, the Buddhist concept of <!--del_lnk--> dependent origination has been compared to modern scientific thought, as well as Western metaphysics.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Is_Buddhism_a_religion.3F">Is Buddhism a religion?</span></h3>
       <p>There are differences of opinion on the question of whether or not Buddhism should be considered a religion. Many sources commonly refer to Buddhism as a religion. For example:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Peter Harvey states: "The English term 'Buddhism' correctly indicates that the religion is characterized by devotion to 'the Buddha', 'Buddhas', or 'buddhahood'."</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Joseph Goldstein states: "Although there are many difference among the various religions of the world, and among the various schools of Buddhism itself, there is also a great deal in common..."</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Other sources note that the answer to this question depends upon how religion is defined. For example:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Surya Das states: "For Buddhism is less a theology or religion than a promise that certain meditative practices and mind trainings can effectively show us how to awaken our Buddha-nature and liberate us from suffering and confusion."</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> B. Alan Wallace states: "When we in the West first engage with Buddhism, it is almost inevitable that we bring out one of our familiar stereotypes and apply it to Buddhism, calling it simply a 'religion.'... But Buddhism has never been simply a religion as we define it in the West. From the very beginning it has also had philosophical elements, as well as empirical and rational elements that may invite the term 'science.'"</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Rupert Gethin states: "I am not concerned here to pronounce on a question that is sometimes asked of Buddhism: is it a religion? Obviously it depends on how one defines &lsquo;a religion&rsquo;. What is certain, however, is that Buddhism does not involve belief in a creator God who has control over human destiny, nor does it seek to define itself by reference to a creed; as Edward Conze has pointed out, it took over 2,000 years and a couple of Western converts to Buddhism to provide it with a creed. On the other hand, Buddhism views activities that would be generally understood as religious&mdash;such as devotional practices and rituals&mdash;as a legitimate, useful, and even essential part of the practice and training that leads to the cessation of suffering. Gethin points out that some key differences between Buddhism and conventionally considered Western religions are that Buddhism does not assert a belief in a creator god, nor does it define itself by a particular creed. On the other hand, Gethin notes, Buddhist practice often includes devotional practices and ritual, which are typically associated with religious belief.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Damien Keown states: "Problems [...] confront us as soon as we try to define what Buddhism is. Is it a religion? A philosophy? A way of life? A code of ethics? It is not easy to classify Buddhism as any of these things, and it challenges us to rethink some of these categories. What, for example, do we mean by &lsquo;religion&rsquo;? Most people would say that religion has something to do with belief in God. [...] If belief in God in this sense is the essence of religion, then Buddhism cannot be a religion. [...] Some have suggested that a new category &ndash; that of the &lsquo;non-theistic&rsquo; religion &ndash; is needed to encompass Buddhism. Another possibility is that our original definition is simply too narrow.</li>
        <li>The <a href="../../wp/d/Dalai_Lama.htm" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a> states: "From one viewpoint, Buddhism is a religion, from another viewpoint Buddhism is a science of mind and not a religion. Buddhism can be a bridge between these two sides. Therefore, with this conviction I try to have closer ties with scientists, mainly in the fields of cosmology, psychology, neurobiology and physics. In these fields there are insights to share, and to a certain extent we can work together."</li>
        <li>Ilkka_Pyysi&auml;inen states: "There are thus great difficulties involved in conceptualizing religion as belief in god(s), superhuman agents, etc., although we intuitively think that some such beings, nevertheless, are essential in religion. As is well-known, Buddhism is the favorite example of scholars who have argued that we should find some other way of defining religion than the one based on the idea of belief in gods or superhuman beings." and "Buddhism does not have to be the problematic touchstone for a global concept of religion."</li>
        <li>Martin Southwold states: "It is argued that Buddhism, though non-theistic, resembles other religions in depending on mystical notions; it is shown how this contributes to understanding the social functions of religions."</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Walpola Rahula states: "The question has often been asked: Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy? It does not matter what you call it. Buddhism remains what it is whatever label you may put on it. The label is immaterial. Even the label 'Buddhism' which we give to the teaching of the Buddha is of little importance. The name one gives it is inessential. <i>What's in a name? That which we call a rose, By any other name would smell as sweet.</i> In the same way Truth needs no label: it is neither Buddhist, Christian, Hindu nor Moslem. It is not the monopoly of anybody. Sectarian labels are a hindrance to the independent understanding of Truth, and they produce harmful prejudices in men's minds."</li>
