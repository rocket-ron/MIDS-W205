       <p>The Bay of Bengal appears as <i>Sinus Gangeticus</i> or <i>Gangeticus Sinus</i>, meaning "Gulf of the Ganges", in ancient maps. In the 10th century the explosion of <!--del_lnk--> Indianized kingdoms, led by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Chola_dynasty.htm" title="Chola Empire">Chola Empire</a>, resulted in the Bay of Bengal being known as <i>the Chola Lake</i>.

       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Rivers">Rivers</span></h2>
       <p>Many major rivers of the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent flow west to east before draining into Bay of Bengal. The <a href="../../wp/g/Ganges.htm" title="Ganges">Ganges</a> is the northernmost of them. Its main channel enters and flows through Bangladesh, where it is called <!--del_lnk--> Padma River, before joining <!--del_lnk--> Meghna River. However, <a href="../../wp/b/Brahmaputra_River.htm" title="Brahmaputra River">Brahmaputra River</a> flows from east to west in <!--del_lnk--> Assam before turning south and entering Bangladesh where it is called <!--del_lnk--> Jamuna River. Jamuna joins Padma and then Padma joins <!--del_lnk--> Meghna River that finally drains into Bay of Bengal. The <!--del_lnk--> Sundarbans mangrove forest is formed at the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers and lies partly in West Bengal and partly in Bangladesh. Brahmaputra at 2,948&nbsp;km (1,832&nbsp;mi) is the 28th <a href="../../wp/l/List_of_rivers_by_length.htm" title="List of rivers by length">longest River</a> in the world. It originates in <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Hooghly River, another channel of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Ganges.htm" title="Ganga">Ganga</a> that flows through <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/k/Kolkata.htm" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> drains into Bay of Bengal in India itself.</p>
       <p>Further south of Bengal, <!--del_lnk--> Mahanadi River, <!--del_lnk--> Godavari River, <!--del_lnk--> Krishna River and <!--del_lnk--> Kaveri River (earlier spelt as Cauvery) are the major rivers that flow from west to east in <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent and drain into Bay of Bengal. Many small rivers also drain directly into Bay of Bengal; the shortest of them is <!--del_lnk--> Cooum River at 64&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi).</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Irrawaddy River also spelt as Ayeyarwady of <a href="../../wp/b/Burma.htm" title="Burma">Burma</a> flows into <!--del_lnk--> Andaman Sea of Bay of Bengal and once had thick <!--del_lnk--> mangrove forest of its own.</p>

       <p>The islands in the bay are very numerous, including the <!--del_lnk--> Andaman Islands, <!--del_lnk--> Nicobar and <!--del_lnk--> Mergui groups of India. The group of islands, Cheduba and others, in the north-east, off the Burmese coast, are remarkable for a chain of mud volcanoes, which are occasionally active. <!--del_lnk--> Great Andaman is the main archipelago or island group of the <!--del_lnk--> Andaman Islands, whereas <!--del_lnk--> Ritchie's Archipelago consists of smaller islands.

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Fisheries production in the Bay of Bengal is six million tonnes per year, more than seven percent of the world's catch. The major transboundary issues relating to shared fisheries are: a decline in the overall availability of fish resources; changes in species composition of catches; the high proportion of juvenile fish in the catch; and changes in <!--del_lnk--> marine biodiversity, especially through loss of vulnerable and <!--del_lnk--> endangered species. The transboundary nature of these issues are: that many <!--del_lnk--> fish stocks are shared between BOBLME countries through the transboundary migration of <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> larvae. <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">Fishing</a> overlaps national jurisdictions, both legally and illegally &ndash; overcapacity and <!--del_lnk--> overfishing in one location forces a migration of fishers and vessels to other locations. All countries (to a greater or lesser degree) are experiencing difficulties in implementing <!--del_lnk--> fisheries management, especially the <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem approach to fisheries. Bay of Bengal countries contribute significantly to the global problem of loss of <!--del_lnk--> vulnerable and <!--del_lnk--> endangered species. The main causes of the issues are: open access to fishing grounds; Government emphasis on increasing fish catches; inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers; increasing fishing effort, especially from <!--del_lnk--> trawlers and <!--del_lnk--> purse seiners; high consumer demand for fish, including for seed and <!--del_lnk--> fishmeal for <!--del_lnk--> aquaculture; ineffective fisheries management; and illegal and destructive fishing.</p>

The transboundary nature of these major issues are: that all three critical habitats occur in all BOBLME countries. <!--del_lnk--> Coastal development for several varying uses of the land and sea are common in all BOBLME countries. Trade in products from all the habitats is transboundary in nature. <a href="../../wp/c/Climate_change.htm" title="Climate change">Climate change</a> impacts are shared by all BOBLME countries. The main causes of the issues are: <!--del_lnk--> food security needs of the coastal poor; lack of <!--del_lnk--> coastal development plans; increasing trade in products from coastal habitats; coastal development and industrialization; ineffective <!--del_lnk--> marine protected areas and lack of enforcement; upstream development that affects water-flow; <!--del_lnk--> intensive upstream agricultural practices; and increasing tourism</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Pollution_and_water_quality">Pollution and water quality</span></h3>
       <p>The major transboundary issues relating to <!--del_lnk--> pollution and <!--del_lnk--> water quality are: sewage-borne pathogens and organic load; solid waste/marine litter; increasing nutrient inputs; oil pollution; persistent organic pollutants (<!--del_lnk--> POPs) and persistent toxic substances (PTSs); sedimentation; and heavy metals. The transboundary nature of these issues are: discharge of untreated/partially treated <!--del_lnk--> sewage being a common problem. Sewage and organic discharges from the <a href="../../wp/g/Ganges.htm" title="Ganges">Ganges</a>-<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Brahmaputra_River.htm" title="Brahmaputra">Brahmaputra</a>-<!--del_lnk--> Meghna River are likely to be transboundary. Plastics and derelict fishing gear can be transported long distances across national boundaries. High nutrient discharges from rivers could intensify largescale hypoxia. Atmospheric transport of nutrients is inherently transboundary. Differences between countries with regard to regulation and enforcement of shipping discharges may drive discharges across boundaries. <!--del_lnk--> Tar balls are transported long distances. POPs/PTSs and <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528element%2529.htm" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, including organo-mercury, undergo long-range transport. <!--del_lnk--> Sedimentation and most heavy metal contamination tend to be localized and lack a strong transboundary dimension. The main causes of the issues are: increasing coastal population density and urbanization; higher consumption, resulting in more waste generated per person; insufficient funds allocated to waste management; migration of industry into BOBLME countries; and proliferation of small industries.</p>

A specialized branch, <!--del_lnk--> Archaeology of shipwrecks studies the salvaged artifacts of ancient ships. Stone anchors, amphorae shards, elephant tusks, hippopotamus teeth, ceramic pottery, a rare wood mast and lead ingots are examples which may survive the test of time for archaeologists to study and place the salvaged findings into a time line of history. Coral reefs, tsunamis, cyclones, mangrove swamps, battles and a criss cross of sea routes in a high trading area combined with pirating have all contributed to shipwrecks in the Bay of Bengal.</p>
