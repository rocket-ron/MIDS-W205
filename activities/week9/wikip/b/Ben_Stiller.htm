       <p>After beginning his acting career with a play, Stiller wrote several mockumentaries, and was offered two of his own shows, both entitled <i>The Ben Stiller Show</i>. He began acting in films, and had his directorial debut with <i><!--del_lnk--> Reality Bites</i>. Throughout his career he has since written, starred in, directed, and/or produced over 50 films including <i><!--del_lnk--> Heavyweights</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> There's Something About Mary</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Meet the Parents</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Zoolander</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Dodgeball</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Tropic Thunder</i>. In addition he has had multiple <!--del_lnk--> cameos in music videos, television shows, and films.</p>

His films have grossed more than $2.1 billion domestically (United States and Canada), with an average of $73 million per film. Throughout his career, he has received several awards and honours including an <!--del_lnk--> Emmy Award, several <!--del_lnk--> MTV Movie Awards, and a <!--del_lnk--> Teen Choice Award.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
       <p>Stiller was born in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>. His father, <!--del_lnk--> Jerry Stiller, is <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/Jews.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a>; his mother <!--del_lnk--> Anne Meara, who is of <!--del_lnk--> Irish Catholic background. Meara converted to <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> after marrying Jerry Stiller(though the family celebrated both <a href="../../wp/h/Hanukkah.htm" title="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Christmas.htm" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>). Stiller's parents frequently took him on the sets of their appearances, including an appearance on <i><!--del_lnk--> The Mike Douglas Show</i> when he was six. He admitted in an interview that he considered his childhood unusual: "In some ways, it was a show-business upbringing&mdash;a lot of traveling, a lot of late nights&mdash;not what you'd call traditional." His sister, actress <!--del_lnk--> Amy Stiller, has made appearances in many of his productions, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Reality Bites</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Zoolander</i>.</p>
       <p>He displayed an early interest in film making and made <!--del_lnk--> Super 8 movies with his sister and friends. At 10 years old, he made his acting debut as a guest on his mother's television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Kate McShane</i>. In the late 1970s he performed with the New York City troupe NYC's First All Children's Theatre, performing in several roles, including the title role in <i>Clever Jack and the Magic Beanstalk.</i> After being inspired by the television show <i><!--del_lnk--> Second City Television</i> while in high school, Stiller realized that he wanted to get involved with sketch comedy.</p>
       <p>Stiller attended the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral School in and graduated from the <!--del_lnk--> Calhoun School in New York in 1983. He started performing on the cabaret circuit as opening act to the cabaret siren <!--del_lnk--> Jadin Wong. Stiller then enrolled as a film student at the <!--del_lnk--> University of California, Los Angeles. After nine months, Stiller left school to move back to New York City. He made his way through acting classes, auditioning, and trying to find an agent.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Acting_career">Acting career</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Beginning_career">Beginning career</span></h3>
       <p>Stiller landed a role in the <!--del_lnk--> Broadway revival of <!--del_lnk--> John Guare's <i><!--del_lnk--> The House of Blue Leaves</i>, alongside <!--del_lnk--> John Mahoney; the production would garner four <!--del_lnk--> Tony Awards. During its run, Stiller produced a satirical <!--del_lnk--> mockumentary whose principal was fellow actor Mahoney. His comedic work was so well received by the cast and crew of the play that he followed up with a 10 minute short called <i>The Hustler of Money</i>, a parody of the <!--del_lnk--> Martin Scorsese film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Colour of Money</i>. The film featured him in a send-up of <!--del_lnk--> Tom Cruise's character and Mahoney in the <!--del_lnk--> Paul Newman role, only this time as a <!--del_lnk--> bowling hustler instead of a <!--del_lnk--> pool shark. The short got the attention of <i><!--del_lnk--> Saturday Night Live</i>, which aired it in 1987, and two years later offered him a spot as a writer. In the meantime, he also had a bit part in <a href="../../wp/s/Steven_Spielberg.htm" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s <i><!--del_lnk--> Empire of the Sun</i>.</p>
       <p>In 1989, Stiller wrote and appeared on a season of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> as a featured performer. However, since the show did not want him to make more short films for the show, he left after five shows. He then put together <i>Elvis Stories</i>, a short film about a fictitious tabloid focused on recent sightings of <a href="../../wp/e/Elvis_Presley.htm" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. The film starred friends and co-stars <!--del_lnk--> John Cusack, <!--del_lnk--> Jeremy Piven, <!--del_lnk--> Mike Myers, <!--del_lnk--> Andy Dick, and Jeff Kahn. The film was considered a success, and led him to develop another film entitled <i>Back to Brooklyn</i> for MTV.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Ben_Stiller_Show"><i>The Ben Stiller Show</i></span></h3>
       <p>MTV was so impressed with <i>Back to Brooklyn</i> that they offered Stiller a 13-episode show in the experimental "vid-com" format. Entitled <i>The Ben Stiller Show</i>, this series mixed comedy sketches with music videos and parodied various television shows, music stars, and films. It starred Stiller, along with main writer Jeff Khan and Harry O'Reilly with occasional appearances by his parents <!--del_lnk--> Jerry Stiller and <!--del_lnk--> Anne Meara, and sister <!--del_lnk--> Amy Stiller.</p>
       <p>Although the show was canceled after its first season, it led to another show entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> The Ben Stiller Show</i> on the <!--del_lnk--> Fox Network in 1992. <i>The Ben Stiller Show</i> aired 12 episodes on Fox, with a 13th unaired episode broadcast by <!--del_lnk--> Comedy Central in a later revival. Among the principal writers on <i>The Ben Stiller Show</i> were Stiller and <!--del_lnk--> Judd Apatow, with the show featuring the ensemble cast of Stiller, <!--del_lnk--> Janeane Garofalo, <!--del_lnk--> Andy Dick, and <!--del_lnk--> Bob Odenkirk. Both <!--del_lnk--> Denise Richards and <!--del_lnk--> Jeanne Tripplehorn appeared as extras in various episodes. Throughout its short run, <i>The Ben Stiller Show</i> frequently appeared at the bottom of the ratings, even as it garnered critical acclaim and eventually won the <!--del_lnk--> Emmy for "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing in a Variety or Music Program" after it was canceled.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Directorial_debut">Directorial debut</span></h3>
       <p>After a few minor film roles in the early 1990s, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Stella</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Highway to Hell</i>, and a cameo in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Nutt House</i>, Stiller devoted his time to writing, fund raising, recruiting cast members, starring in, and directing <i><!--del_lnk--> Reality Bites</i>. The film was produced by <!--del_lnk--> Danny DeVito (who later directed Stiller's 2003 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Duplex</i> and produced the 2004 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Along Came Polly</i>). <i>Reality Bites</i> debuted as the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend and received mixed reviews.</p>
       <p>He joined his parents in the family film <i><!--del_lnk--> Heavyweights</i>, in which he played two roles, and then had a brief uncredited role in <a href="../../wp/a/Adam_Sandler.htm" title="Adam Sandler">Adam Sandler</a>'s <i><!--del_lnk--> Happy Gilmore</i>. Next, he had lead roles in <i><!--del_lnk--> If Lucy Fell</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Flirting with Disaster</i>, before tackling his next directorial effort with <i><!--del_lnk--> The Cable Guy</i> which starred <!--del_lnk--> Jim Carrey. Stiller once again was featured in his own film as twins. The film received mixed reviews, but was noted for paying the highest salary for an actor up to that point. <!--del_lnk--> Jim Carrey received $20 million for his work in the film. The film also connected Stiller with future <!--del_lnk--> Frat Pack members <a href="../../wp/j/Jack_Black.htm" title="Jack Black">Jack Black</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Owen Wilson.</p>
       <p>Also in 1996, MTV invited Stiller to host the VH1 Fashion Awards. Along with <!--del_lnk--> SNL writer Drake Sather, Stiller developed a short film for the awards about a male model known as Derek Zoolander. It was so well received that Stiller developed another short film about the character for the 1997 VH1 Fashion Awards and finally remade the skit into a film.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Comedy_career">Comedy career</span></h3>
       <p>In 1998, Stiller put aside his directing ambitions to star in <i><!--del_lnk--> There's Something About Mary</i> alongside <a href="../../wp/c/Cameron_Diaz.htm" title="Cameron Diaz">Cameron Diaz</a>, which accelerated Stiller's acting career. That year he also starred in several dramas including <i><!--del_lnk--> Zero Effect</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Your Friends &amp; Neighbors</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Permanent Midnight</i>. Stiller was invited to take part in hosting the Music Video awards, for which he developed a parody of the <!--del_lnk--> Backstreet Boys and performed a sketch with his father, commenting on his current career.</p>
       <p>In 1999, he starred in three films, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Mystery Men</i>, where he played a superhero wannabe called Mr. Furious. He returned to directing with a new spoof television series for Fox entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Heat Vision and Jack</i>, starring Jack Black, however, the show was not picked up by Fox after its pilot episode and the series was cancelled.</p>
       <p>2000 would be a better year for Stiller as he starred in three more films including one of his most recognizable roles, as a male nurse named Greg Focker in <i><!--del_lnk--> Meet the Parents</i> opposite <!--del_lnk--> Robert De Niro. The film was well-received by critics, grossed over $330 million worldwide, and spawned two sequels. Also in 2000, MTV again invited Stiller to make another short film and he developed <i>Mission: Improbable</i>, a spoof of <!--del_lnk--> Tom Cruise's role in <i><!--del_lnk--> Mission: Impossible II</i> and other films.</p>

       <p>In 2001, Stiller would direct his third feature film, <i><!--del_lnk--> Zoolander</i>, which focused on the character Derek Zoolander (played by Stiller) that he developed for the VH1 Fashion Awards. The film featured multiple cameos from a variety of celebrities including <!--del_lnk--> Donald Trump, <!--del_lnk--> Paris Hilton, <!--del_lnk--> Lenny Kravitz, <!--del_lnk--> Heidi Klum, and <!--del_lnk--> David Bowie among others. The film was banned in <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> (as the plot centered on an assassination attempt of a Malaysian prime minister) while shots of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Trade_Center.htm" title="World Trade Center">World Trade Centre</a> were digitally removed and hidden for the film's release after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/September_11_attacks.htm" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11 terrorist attacks</a>.</p>
       <p>After Stiller worked with <!--del_lnk--> Owen Wilson in <i>Zoolander</i>, they joined together again for <i><!--del_lnk--> The Royal Tenenbaums</i>. Over the next two years, Stiller continued with the lackluster box office film <i><!--del_lnk--> Duplex</i> and several cameos in <i><!--del_lnk--> Orange County</i> and <i>Nobody Knows Anything!</i>. He also guest-starred on several television shows, including an appearance in an episode of the television series <i><!--del_lnk--> King Of Queens</i> in a flashback as the father of the character Arthur (played by Jerry Stiller). He also made a guest appearance on <!--del_lnk--> World Wrestling Entertainment's <!--del_lnk--> WWE Raw.</p>
       <p>In 2004, Stiller appeared in six different films, all of which were comedies, and include some of his highest grossing films. They include <i><!--del_lnk--> Starsky &amp; Hutch</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Envy</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</i>, an uncredited cameo in <i><!--del_lnk--> Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Along Came Polly</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Meet the Fockers</i>. While <i>Envy</i> only grossed $14.5 million worldwide, his most successful film of the year was <i>Meet the Fockers</i>, which grossed over $516.6 million worldwide. In 2005, Stiller would begin his first attempt at a computer-animated film with <i><!--del_lnk--> Madagascar</i>, which performed so well at the box office that it resulted in a <!--del_lnk--> sequel released in 2008.</p>
