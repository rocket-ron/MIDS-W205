       <p><b>Bears</b> (<!--del_lnk--> family <i>Ursidae</i>) are <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> order <!--del_lnk--> Carnivora. Bears are classified as <!--del_lnk--> caniforms, or doglike carnivorans, with the <!--del_lnk--> pinnipeds being their closest living relatives. Although there are only eight living <a href="../../wp/s/Species.htm" title="Species">species</a> of bear, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of <!--del_lnk--> habitats throughout the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Hemisphere and partially in the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Hemisphere. That which pertains to bears is called <b>ursine</b>. Bears are found in the <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continents</a> of <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>.</p>
       <p>Common characteristics of modern bears include a large body with stocky legs, a long snout, shaggy hair, <!--del_lnk--> plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and a short tail. While the <a href="../../wp/p/Polar_bear.htm" title="Polar bear">polar bear</a> is mostly carnivorous and the <a href="../../wp/g/Giant_panda.htm" title="Giant panda">giant panda</a> feeds almost entirely on <!--del_lnk--> bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous, with largely varied diets including both plants and animals.</p>
       <p>With the exceptions of <!--del_lnk--> courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They are sometimes <!--del_lnk--> diurnal, but are usually active during the night (<!--del_lnk--> nocturnal) or twilight (<!--del_lnk--> crepuscular). Bears are aided by an excellent <!--del_lnk--> sense of smell, and despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they can run quickly and are adept climbers and swimmers. Bears use shelters such as caves and burrows as their dens, which are occupied by most species during the winter for a long period of sleep similar to <!--del_lnk--> hibernation.</p>
       <p>Bears have been hunted since <!--del_lnk--> prehistoric times for their meat and fur. To this day, they play a prominent role in the <!--del_lnk--> arts, <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythology</a>, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, the bear's existence has been pressured through the encroachment of their habitats and the illegal trade of bears and bear parts, including the <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asian</a> <!--del_lnk--> bile bear market. The <!--del_lnk--> IUCN lists six bear species as <!--del_lnk--> vulnerable or <!--del_lnk--> endangered, and even "<!--del_lnk--> least concern" species such as the <!--del_lnk--> brown bear are at risk of <!--del_lnk--> extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations is prohibited, but still ongoing.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
       <p>The bear's courtship period is very brief. Bears in northern climates reproduce seasonally, usually after a period of inactivity similar to hibernation, although tropical species breed all year round. Cubs are born toothless, blind, and bald. The cubs of brown bears, usually born in litters of 1&ndash;3, will typically stay with the mother for two full seasons. They feed on their mother's milk through the duration of their relationship with their mother, although as the cubs continue to grow, nursing becomes less frequent and learn to begin hunting with the mother. They will remain with the mother for approximately three years, until she enters the next cycle of estrus and drives the cubs off. Bears will reach sexual maturity in five to seven years.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dentition">Dentition</span></h3>
       <p>Unlike most other members of the <!--del_lnk--> Carnivora, bears have relatively undeveloped <!--del_lnk--> carnassial teeth, and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter. The <!--del_lnk--> canine teeth are large, and the <!--del_lnk--> molar teeth flat and crushing. There is considerable variation in <!--del_lnk--> dental formula even within a given species. It has been suggested that this indicates bears are still in the process of evolving from a carnivorous to a predominantly herbivorous diet. Polar bears appear to have secondarily re-evolved fully functional carnassials, as their diet has switched back towards carnivory. The dental formula for living bears is:</p>

       <p>Many bears of northern regions are assumed to <!--del_lnk--> hibernate in the winter. While many bear species do go into a physiological state called hibernation or winter sleep, it is not true hibernation. In true hibernators, body temperatures drop to near ambient and heart rate slows drastically, but the animals periodically rouse themselves to urinate or defecate and to eat from stored food. The body temperature of bears, on the other hand, drops only a few degrees from normal and heart rate slows only slightly. They normally do not wake during this "hibernation", and therefore do not eat, drink, urinate or defecate the entire period. Higher body heat and being easily roused may be adaptations, because females give birth to their cubs during this winter sleep. It can therefore be considered a more efficient form of hibernation because they need not awake through the entire period, but they are more quickly and easily awakened at the end of their hibernation. They have to stay in a den for the whole hibernation.</p>

       <p>Some species, such as the <a href="../../wp/p/Polar_bear.htm" title="Polar bear">polar bear</a>, <!--del_lnk--> American black bear, and the <!--del_lnk--> grizzly bear, are dangerous to humans, especially in areas where they have become used to people. On the west coast of <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> American black bear has become an integral part of the silviculture industries, specifically <!--del_lnk--> treeplanting. The bears are coaxed into areas of harvested forest to "flush out" the other wildlife, i.e. <!--del_lnk--> moose, which are a far greater threat to planters. For the most part, bears are shy and are easily frightened of humans. They will, however, defend their cubs ferociously if a situation calls for it.</p>
       <p>Laws have been passed in many areas of the world to protect bears from hunters or <!--del_lnk--> habitat destruction. Bears in captivity have been trained to dance, box, or ride <a href="../../wp/b/Bicycle.htm" title="Bicycle">bicycles</a>; however, this use of the animals became controversial in the late 20th century.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bears_as_food_and_medicine">Bears as food and medicine</span></h3>
       <p>Many people enjoy hunting bears and eating them. Their meat is dark and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are considered a delicacy. The peoples of China, Japan, and Korea use bears' body parts and secretions (notably their gallbladders and bile) as part of traditional <!--del_lnk--> Chinese medicine. It is believed more than 12,000 <!--del_lnk--> bile bears are kept on farms, farmed for their bile, in China, Vietnam and South Korea. Bear meat must be cooked thoroughly as it can often be infected with <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Trichinosis.htm" title="Trichinellosis">trichinellosis</a>.   </p>

       <p>The Ursidae family belongs to the order Carnivora and is one of nine families in the suborder Caniformia, or "doglike" carnivorans. Bears' closest living relatives are the <!--del_lnk--> pinnipeds, a clade of three families: <!--del_lnk--> Odobenidae (the walrus), <!--del_lnk--> Otariidae (fur seals and sea lions), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Earless_seal.htm" title="Phocidae">Phocidae</a> (true or earless seals). Bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the <a href="../../wp/g/Giant_panda.htm" title="Giant panda">giant panda</a>), Tremarctinae (monotypic with the <!--del_lnk--> Spectacled Bear), and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending upon authority).</p>
       <p>The origins of Ursidae can be traced back to the very small and graceful <i><!--del_lnk--> Parictis</i> that had a skull only 7&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;in) long. Parictis first occur in North America in the Late <a href="../../wp/e/Eocene.htm" title="Eocene">Eocene</a> (ca. 38 million years ago), but this <a href="../../wp/g/Genus.htm" title="Genus">genus</a> did not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the <a href="../../wp/m/Miocene.htm" title="Miocene">Miocene</a>. The raccoon-sized, dog-like <i><!--del_lnk--> Cephalogale</i>, however, is widely regarded as the most primitive ursid and is ideally suited as a representative basal taxon for the family. <i>Cephalogale</i> first appeared during the middle <a href="../../wp/o/Oligocene.htm" title="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> and early Miocene (approximately 20&ndash;30 million years ago) in Europe. <i>Cephalogale</i> gave rise to a lineage of early bears of the genus <i>Ursavus</i>. This genus radiated in Asia and ultimately gave rise to the first true bears (genus <i>Ursus</i>) in Europe, 5 million years ago. Even among its primitive species, such as <i>C. minor</i>, it exhibits typical ursid <!--del_lnk--> synapomorphic <!--del_lnk--> dentition such as posteriorly oriented M2 postprotocrista <!--del_lnk--> molars, elongated m2 molars, and a reduction of the premolars. Living members of the ursids are <!--del_lnk--> morphologically well defined by their hypocarnivorous (non-strictly meat-eating) dentitions, but fossil ursids include <!--del_lnk--> hypercarnivorous (strictly meat-eating) taxa, although they never achieved the extreme hypercarnivory seen in <!--del_lnk--> mustelids. Cephalogale was a mesocarnivore (intermediate meat-eater). Other extinct bear genera include <i><!--del_lnk--> Arctodus</i>, <i>Agriarctos</i>, <i>Plionarctos</i> and <i>Indarctos</i>.</p>
       <p>It is uncertain whether ursids were in Asia during the late Eocene, although there is some suggestion that a limited immigration from Asia may have produced <i>Parictis</i> in North America due to the major sea level lowstand at ca. 37 Ma, but no <i>Parictis</i> fossils have yet to be found in East Asia. Ursids did, however, become very diversified in Asia later during the Oligocene. Four genera representing two subfamilies (Amphicynodontinae and Hemicyoninae) have been discovered in the Oligocene of Asia: <i>Amphicticeps</i>, <i>Amphicynodon</i>, <i>Pachycynodon</i>, and <i>Cephalogale</i>. <i>Amphicticeps</i> is endemic from Asia and the other three genera are common to both Asia and Europe. This indicates migration of ursids between Asia and Europe during the Oligocene and migration of several taxa from Asia to North America likely occurred later during the late Oligocene or early Miocene. Although <i>Amphicticeps</i> is morphologically closely related to <i>Allocyon</i>, and also to <i>Kolponomos</i> of North America, no single genus of the Ursidae is known to be common to both Eurasia and North America. Cephalogale, however, do appear in North America in the early Miocene. It is interesting to note that rodents, such as <i>Haplomys</i> and <i>Pseudotheridomys</i> (late Oligocene) and <i>Plesiosminthus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Palaeocastor</i> (early Miocene), are common to both Asia and North America and this indicates that faunal exchange did occur between Asia and North America during the late Oligocene to early Miocene. Ursid migration from Asia to North America would therefore have also been very likely to occur during this time. Three major carnivoran migrations between Eurasia and North America are recognized in the late <!--del_lnk--> Neogene that definitely included ursids. The first around 20 Ma (probably 21&ndash;18 Ma) were waves of intermittent dispersals that included <i>Amphicynodon</i>, <i>Cephalogale</i> and <i>Ursavus</i>. The second migration occurred at about 7&ndash;8 Ma and included <i><!--del_lnk--> Agriotherium</i>. And the last wave took place in the early <a href="../../wp/p/Pliocene.htm" title="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> 4 Ma with <i>Ursus</i>.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/g/Giant_panda.htm" title="Giant panda">giant panda</a>'s taxonomy has long been debated. Its original classification by <!--del_lnk--> Armand David in 1869 was within the bear genus <!--del_lnk--> Ursus, but in 1870 it was reclassified by <!--del_lnk--> Alphonse Milne-Edwards to the <!--del_lnk--> raccoon family. In recent studies, the majority of <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> analyses suggest that the giant panda has a much closer relationship to other bears and should be considered a member of the family <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bear.htm" title="Ursidae">Ursidae</a>. The status of the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_panda.htm" title="Red panda">red panda</a> remains uncertain, but many experts, including Wilson and Reeder, classify it as a member of the bear family. Others place it with the raccoons in <!--del_lnk--> Procyonidae or in its own family, the <!--del_lnk--> Ailuridae. Multiple similarities between the two pandas, including the presence of false thumbs, are thought to represent <!--del_lnk--> convergent evolution for feeding primarily on bamboo.</p>
       <p>There is also evidence that, unlike their neighbors elsewhere, the <!--del_lnk--> brown bears of Alaska's <!--del_lnk--> ABC islands are more closely related to <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Polar_bear.htm" title="Polar bears">polar bears</a> than they are to other brown bears in the world. Researchers Gerald Shields and Sandra Talbot of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Alaska Fairbanks Institute of Arctic <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">Biology</a> studied the <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> of several samples of the species and found that their DNA is different from that of other brown bears. The researchers discovered that their DNA was unique compared to brown bears anywhere else in the world. The discovery has shown that while all other brown bears share a brown bear as their closest relative, those of Alaska's ABC Islands differ and share their closest relation with the polar bear. There is also supposed to be a very rare large bear in China called the blue bear, which presumably is a type of black bear. This animal has never been photographed.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Koalas are often referred to as bears due to their appearance; they are not bears, however, but <!--del_lnk--> marsupials.</p>

       <p>Some evidence has been brought to light on prehistoric <!--del_lnk--> bear worship, see <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Arcturus, <!--del_lnk--> Great Bear, <!--del_lnk--> Berserker, <!--del_lnk--> Kalevala. Anthropologists such as <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Campbell have regarded this as a common feature in most of the <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">fishing</a> and <!--del_lnk--> hunting-<a href="../../wp/t/Tribe.htm" title="Tribe">tribes</a>. The prehistoric <!--del_lnk--> Finns, along with most <!--del_lnk--> Finno-Ugric peoples, considered the bear as the spirit of one's forefathers. This is why the bear was a greatly respected animal, with several euphemistic names.</p>
       <p>This kind of attitude is reflected in the traditional <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> <!--del_lnk--> fairy tale "<i><!--del_lnk--> Morozko</i>", whose arrogant protagonist Ivan tries to kill a mother bear and her cubs &mdash; and is punished and humbled by having his own head turned magically into a bear's head and being subsequently shunned by human society.</p>
       <p>There has been evidence about early bear worship in China and among the <!--del_lnk--> Ainu culture as well. In the <!--del_lnk--> Korean mythology, <!--del_lnk--> Korean people identifies bear as their ancestor and symbolic animal.</p>
       <p>In addition, the <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Indo-European word for bear, <i>*hr&#x325;ktos</i> (ancestral to the Greek <i>arktos</i>, Latin <i>ursus</i>, Welsh <i>arth</i> (cf. <!--del_lnk--> Arthur), Sanskrit <i>*&#x1E5B;k&#x1E63;a</i>, Hittite <i>hartagga</i>) seems to have been subject to <!--del_lnk--> taboo deformation or replacement (as was the word for <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gray_wolf.htm" title="Wolf">wolf</a>, <i>wlk<sup>w</sup>os</i>), resulting in the use of numerous unrelated words with meanings like "brown one" (English <i>bruin</i>) and "honey-eater" (Slavic <i>medved</i>). Thus four separate Indo-European language groups do not share the same PIE root. The theory of the bear taboo is taught to almost all beginning students of Indo-European and historical linguistics; the putative original PIE word for bear is itself descriptive, because a cognate word in Sanskrit is <i>rakshas</i>, meaning "harm, injury".</p>

       <p>The physical attributes and behaviours of bears are commonly used in figures of speech in English. In the <a href="../../wp/s/Stock_market.htm" title="Stock market">stock market</a>, a <i><!--del_lnk--> bear market</i> is a period of declining prices. Pessimistic forecasting or negative activity is said to be <i>bearish</i> (due to the stereotypical posture of bears looking downwards), and one who expresses bearish sentiment is a <i>bear</i>. Its opposite is a <i>bull market</i>, and <i>bullish</i> sentiment from <i>bulls</i>. In <!--del_lnk--> gay slang, the term "<!--del_lnk--> bear" refers to male individuals who possess physical attributes much like a bear, such as a heavy build, abundant body hair, and commonly facial hair. To "try like a bear" means to try your hardest to catch the attention of a certain lady. The harder you try, the better the bear you are. A <i><!--del_lnk--> bear hug</i> is typically a tight <!--del_lnk--> hug that involves wrapping one's arms around another person, often leaving that person's arms immobile. It was used in the <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> political ad "Bear in the woods."</p>

This expression evolved as an outgrowth of the experience pioneer hunters and mountainmen had when tracking bear. Bears often lay down false tracks and are notorious for doubling back on anything tracking them.

       <p>In Scandinavia the word for bear is <i><!--del_lnk--> Bj&ouml;rn</i> (or <i>Bj&oslash;rn</i>), and is a relatively common given name for males. The use of this name is ancient and has been found mentioned in several <!--del_lnk--> runestone inscriptions. The name was also used by J.R.R. Tolkien in his book "The Hobbit", where a bear-like character is named <!--del_lnk--> Beorn.</p>
       <p>The female first name "Ursula", originally derived from a Christian <!--del_lnk--> saint's name and common in English- and German-speaking countries, means "Little she-bear" (dimunitive of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> "ursa"). In Switzerland the male first name "Urs" is especially popular.</p>
       <p>In <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian (language)">Russian</a> and other <!--del_lnk--> Slavic languages, the word for bear, "<!--del_lnk--> Medved" (&#x43C;&#x435;&#x434;&#x432;&#x435;&#x434;&#x44C;), and variants or derivatives such as <!--del_lnk--> Medvedev are common surnames.</p>
       <p>In East European Jewish communities, the name "Ber" (&#x5D1;&#x5E2;&#x5E8;) &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Yiddish cognate of "Bear" &mdash; has been attested as a common male first name, at least since the 18th century, and was among others the name of several prominent <!--del_lnk--> Rabbis. The Yiddish "Ber" is still in use among <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel, the US and other countries.</p>
       <p>With the transition from Yiddish to <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> under the influence of <a href="../../wp/z/Zionism.htm" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>, the Hebrew word for "bear", "Dov" (&#x5D3;&#x5D1;), was taken up in contemporary <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> and is at present among the commonly used male first names in that country.</p>
