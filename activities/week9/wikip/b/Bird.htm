       <p><b>Birds</b> (<!--del_lnk--> class <b>Aves</b>) are <a href="../../wp/f/Feather.htm" title="Feather">feathered</a>, <!--del_lnk--> winged, <!--del_lnk--> bipedal, <!--del_lnk--> endothermic (<!--del_lnk--> warm-blooded), <!--del_lnk--> egg-laying, <a href="../../wp/v/Vertebrate.htm" title="Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> animals. With around 10,000 living species, they are the most <!--del_lnk--> speciose class of <!--del_lnk--> tetrapod vertebrates. All present species belong to the subclass <!--del_lnk--> Neornithes, and inhabit ecosystems across the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. <!--del_lnk--> Extant birds range in size from the 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) <!--del_lnk--> Bee Hummingbird to the 2.75&nbsp;m (9&nbsp;ft) <a href="../../wp/o/Ostrich.htm" title="Ostrich">Ostrich</a>. The <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">fossil record</a> indicates that birds emerged within <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="../../wp/d/Dinosaur.htm" title="Dinosaur">dinosaurs</a> during the <a href="../../wp/j/Jurassic.htm" title="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> period, around 160 million years (Ma) ago. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontologist">Paleontologists</a> regard birds as the only <!--del_lnk--> clade of dinosaurs to have survived the <!--del_lnk--> Cretaceous&ndash;Paleogene extinction event 65.5 Ma (million years) ago.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Modern birds are <!--del_lnk--> characterised by <a href="../../wp/f/Feather.htm" title="Feather">feathers</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> beak with no <!--del_lnk--> teeth, the <!--del_lnk--> laying of <!--del_lnk--> hard-shelled eggs, a high <!--del_lnk--> metabolic rate, a four-chambered <a href="../../wp/h/Heart.htm" title="Heart">heart</a>, and a lightweight but strong <!--del_lnk--> skeleton. All living species of birds have wings; the most recent species without wings was the <!--del_lnk--> moa, which is generally considered to have become extinct in the 16th century. Wings are evolved forelimbs, and most bird species can <!--del_lnk--> fly. Flightless birds include <!--del_lnk--> ratites, <a href="../../wp/p/Penguin.htm" title="Penguin">penguins</a>, and a number of diverse <!--del_lnk--> endemic island species. Birds also have unique <!--del_lnk--> digestive and <!--del_lnk--> respiratory systems that are highly adapted for flight. Some birds, especially <!--del_lnk--> corvids and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Parrot.htm" title="Parrots">parrots</a>, are among the most intelligent animal species; a number of bird species have been observed <!--del_lnk--> manufacturing and using tools, and many social species exhibit cultural transmission of knowledge across generations.</p>
       <p>Many species undertake long distance annual <a href="../../wp/b/Bird_migration.htm" title="Bird migration">migrations</a>, and many more perform shorter irregular movements. Birds are social; they communicate using visual signals and through calls and <!--del_lnk--> songs, and participate in social behaviours, including <!--del_lnk--> cooperative breeding and hunting, <!--del_lnk--> flocking, and <!--del_lnk--> mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are <!--del_lnk--> socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have <!--del_lnk--> polygynous ("many females") or, rarely, <!--del_lnk--> polyandrous ("many males") breeding systems. Eggs are usually laid in a nest and <!--del_lnk--> incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.</p>
       <p>Many species are of economic importance, mostly as sources of food acquired through hunting or farming. Some species, particularly <!--del_lnk--> songbirds and <a href="../../wp/p/Parrot.htm" title="Parrot">parrots</a>, are popular as pets. Other uses include the harvesting of <!--del_lnk--> guano (droppings) for use as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertiliser">fertiliser</a>. Birds <!--del_lnk--> figure prominently in all aspects of human culture from religion to poetry to popular music. About 120&ndash;130 species have become <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinct</a> as a result of human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Currently about 1,200 species of birds are threatened with extinction by human activities, though efforts are underway to <!--del_lnk--> protect them.</p>

       <p>The first <a href="../../wp/b/Biological_classification.htm" title="Biological classification">classification</a> of birds was developed by <!--del_lnk--> Francis Willughby and <!--del_lnk--> John Ray in their 1676 volume <i>Ornithologiae</i>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Carl_Linnaeus.htm" title="Carolus Linnaeus">Carolus Linnaeus</a> modified that work in 1758 to devise the <!--del_lnk--> taxonomic classification system currently in use. Birds are categorised as the <!--del_lnk--> biological class Aves in <!--del_lnk--> Linnaean taxonomy. <!--del_lnk--> Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the dinosaur <!--del_lnk--> clade <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">Theropoda</a>. Aves and a sister group, the clade <!--del_lnk--> Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the <a href="../../wp/r/Reptile.htm" title="Reptile">reptile</a> clade <!--del_lnk--> Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined <!--del_lnk--> phylogenetically as all descendants of the <!--del_lnk--> most recent common ancestor of modern birds and <i><a href="../../wp/a/Archaeopteryx.htm" title="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx lithographica</a></i>. However, an earlier definition proposed by <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the <!--del_lnk--> Phylocode system. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the modern bird groups, the <!--del_lnk--> crown group. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the <!--del_lnk--> Avialae, in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.</p>
       <p>All modern birds lie within the crown group <!--del_lnk--> Neornithes, which has two subdivisions: the <!--del_lnk--> Palaeognathae, which includes the flightless <!--del_lnk--> ratites (such as the <a href="../../wp/o/Ostrich.htm" title="Ostrich">ostriches</a>) and the weak-flying <!--del_lnk--> tinamous, and the extremely diverse <!--del_lnk--> Neognathae, containing all other birds. These two subdivisions are often given the <!--del_lnk--> rank of <!--del_lnk--> superorder, although <!--del_lnk--> Livezey and Zusi assigned them "cohort" rank. Depending on the <!--del_lnk--> taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 to 10,050.</p>

       <p>Based on fossil and biological evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialized subgroup of <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">theropod</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Dinosaur.htm" title="Dinosauria">dinosaurs</a>. More specifically, they are members of <!--del_lnk--> Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes <!--del_lnk--> dromaeosaurs and <!--del_lnk--> oviraptorids, among others. As scientists have discovered more nonavian theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between nonbirds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the <!--del_lnk--> Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small <!--del_lnk--> theropod dinosaurs had feathers, contribute to this ambiguity.</p>
       <p>The consensus view in contemporary <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">paleontology</a> is that the birds, or <!--del_lnk--> avialans, are the closest relatives of the <!--del_lnk--> deinonychosaurs, which include <!--del_lnk--> dromaeosaurids, <!--del_lnk--> troodontids and possibly <!--del_lnk--> archaeopterygids. Together, these three form a group called <!--del_lnk--> Paraves. Some <!--del_lnk--> basal members of this group, such as <i><a href="../../wp/m/Microraptor.htm" title="Microraptor">Microraptor</a></i> and <i><a href="../../wp/a/Archaeopteryx.htm" title="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a></i>, have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. The most basal deinonychosaurs are very small. This evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been <!--del_lnk--> arboreal, may have been able to glide, or both. Unlike <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and the feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent studies suggest that the first birds were <a href="../../wp/h/Herbivore.htm" title="Herbivore">herbivores</a>.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Late Jurassic <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is well known as one of the first <!--del_lnk--> transitional fossils to be found, and it provided support for the theory of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a> in the late 19th century. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was the first fossil to display both clearly reptilian characteristics: teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail, as well as wings with flight feathers identical to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of modern birds, though it is possibly closely related to the real ancestor.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Alternative_scientific_theories_and_controversies">Alternative scientific theories and controversies</span></h4>
       <p>Early disagreements on the origins of birds included whether birds evolved from <a href="../../wp/d/Dinosaur.htm" title="Dinosaur">dinosaurs</a> or more primitive <!--del_lnk--> archosaurs. Within the dinosaur camp, there were disagreements as to whether <a href="../../wp/o/Ornithischia.htm" title="Ornithischia">ornithischian</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropod">theropod</a> dinosaurs were the more likely ancestors. Although ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs share the hip structure of modern birds, birds are thought to have originated from the <a href="../../wp/s/Saurischia.htm" title="Saurischia">saurischian</a> (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs, and therefore evolved their hip structure <!--del_lnk--> independently. In fact, a bird-like hip structure evolved a third time among a peculiar group of theropods known as the <!--del_lnk--> Therizinosauridae.</p>
       <p>A small minority of researchers, such as paleornithologist <!--del_lnk--> Alan Feduccia of the <!--del_lnk--> University of North Carolina, challenge the majority view, contending that birds are not dinosaurs, but evolved from early archosaurs like <i><!--del_lnk--> Longisquama</i>.</p>

       <p>Birds diversified into a wide variety of forms during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous Period">Cretaceous Period</a>. Many groups retained <!--del_lnk--> primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of bird groups, including <!--del_lnk--> modern birds (Neornithes). While the earliest forms, such as <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Jeholornis</i>, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced birds were shortened with the advent of the <!--del_lnk--> pygostyle bone in the <!--del_lnk--> clade Pygostylia. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved better olfactory senses.</p>
       <p>The first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed birds to evolve were the <!--del_lnk--> Enantiornithes, or "opposite birds", so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds. Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches, from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters.</p>
       <p>Many species of the second major bird lineage to diversify, the <!--del_lnk--> Ornithurae (including the ancestors of modern birds), specialised in eating fish, like the superficially <a href="../../wp/g/Gull.htm" title="Gull">gull</a>-like subclass <!--del_lnk--> Ichthyornithes (fish birds). One order of Mesozoic seabirds, the <!--del_lnk--> Hesperornithiformes, became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments, they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic. Despite their extreme specializations, the Hesperornithiformes represent some of the closest relatives of modern birds.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diversification_of_modern_birds">Diversification of modern birds</span></h3>
       <p>Containing all modern birds, the subclass Neornithes is, due to the discovery of <i><!--del_lnk--> Vegavis</i>, now known to have evolved into some basic lineages by the end of the Cretaceous and is split into two superorders, the <!--del_lnk--> Palaeognathae and <!--del_lnk--> Neognathae. The paleognaths include the <!--del_lnk--> tinamous of <a href="../../wp/c/Central_America.htm" title="Central America">Central</a> and South America and the <!--del_lnk--> ratites. The basal divergence from the remaining Neognathes was that of the <!--del_lnk--> Galloanserae, the superorder containing the <!--del_lnk--> Anseriformes (<!--del_lnk--> ducks, <a href="../../wp/g/Goose.htm" title="Goose">geese</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Swan.htm" title="Swan">swans</a> and <!--del_lnk--> screamers) and the <!--del_lnk--> Galliformes (the <!--del_lnk--> pheasants, <!--del_lnk--> grouse, and their allies, together with the <!--del_lnk--> mound builders and the <!--del_lnk--> guans and their allies). The dates for the splits are much debated by scientists. The Neornithes are agreed to have evolved in the Cretaceous, and the split between the Galloanseri from other Neognathes occurred before the <!--del_lnk--> Cretaceous&ndash;Paleogene extinction event, but there are different opinions about whether the <!--del_lnk--> radiation of the remaining Neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs. This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossil</a> evidence supports a <!--del_lnk--> Tertiary radiation. Attempts to reconcile the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial.</p>
       <p>The classification of birds is a contentious issue. <!--del_lnk--> Sibley and <!--del_lnk--> Ahlquist's <i>Phylogeny and Classification of Birds</i> (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.</p>

       <p>This is a list of the taxonomic orders in the subclass Neornithes, or modern birds. This list uses the traditional classification (the so-called <!--del_lnk--> Clements order), revised by the Sibley-Monroe classification. The <!--del_lnk--> list of birds gives a more detailed summary of the orders, including families.</p>
       <p><b>Subclass <!--del_lnk--> Neornithes</b><br /> The subclass Neornithes has two extant <!--del_lnk--> superorders&nbsp;&ndash;</p>
       <p>Superorder <!--del_lnk--> Palaeognathae:</p>
       <p>The name of the superorder is derived from <i>paleognath</i>, the ancient Greek for "old jaws" in reference to the skeletal anatomy of the palate, which is described as more primitive and reptilian than that in other birds. The Palaeognathae consists of two orders which comprise 49 existing species.</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Struthioniformes&mdash;<a href="../../wp/o/Ostrich.htm" title="Ostrich">ostriches</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Emu.htm" title="Emu">emus</a>, <!--del_lnk--> kiwis, and allies</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Tinamiformes&mdash;tinamous</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Superorder <!--del_lnk--> Neognathae:</p>
       <p>The superorder Neognathae comprises 27 orders which have a total of nearly ten thousand species. The Neognathae have undergone <!--del_lnk--> adaptive radiation to produce the staggering diversity of form (especially of the bill and feet), function, and behaviour that are seen today.</p>
       <p>The orders comprising the Neognathae are:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Anseriformes&mdash;waterfowl</li>

       <p>The radically different Sibley-Monroe classification (<!--del_lnk--> Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy), based on molecular data, found widespread adoption in a few aspects, as recent molecular, fossil, and anatomical evidence supported the <!--del_lnk--> Galloanserae.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents, reaching their southern extreme in the <!--del_lnk--> Snow Petrel's breeding colonies up to 440 kilometres (270&nbsp;mi) inland in <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. The highest bird <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">diversity</a> occurs in tropical regions. It was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher <!--del_lnk--> speciation rates in the tropics, however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinction</a> rates than in the tropics. Several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world's oceans and in them, with some <!--del_lnk--> seabird species coming ashore only to breed and some <a href="../../wp/p/Penguin.htm" title="Penguin">penguins</a> have been recorded diving up to 300 metres (980&nbsp;ft).</p>
       <p>Many bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been <!--del_lnk--> introduced by humans. Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Common_Pheasant.htm" title="Ring-necked Pheasant">Ring-necked Pheasant</a>, for example, has been introduced around the world as a <!--del_lnk--> game bird. Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild <!--del_lnk--> Monk Parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity. Some species, including <!--del_lnk--> Cattle Egret, <!--del_lnk--> Yellow-headed Caracara and <a href="../../wp/g/Galah.htm" title="Galah">Galah</a>, have <!--del_lnk--> spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural practices</a> created suitable new habitat.</p>

       <p>Compared with other vertebrates, birds have a <!--del_lnk--> body plan that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate <!--del_lnk--> flight.</p>
       <p>The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. They have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the <!--del_lnk--> respiratory system. The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show <!--del_lnk--> cranial sutures. The <a href="../../wp/o/Orbit_%2528anatomy%2529.htm" title="Orbit (anatomy)">orbits</a> are large and separated by a bony <!--del_lnk--> septum. The <!--del_lnk--> spine has cervical, thoracic, lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical (neck) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible, but movement is reduced in the anterior <!--del_lnk--> thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae. The last few are fused with the <!--del_lnk--> pelvis to form the <!--del_lnk--> synsacrum. The ribs are flattened and the <!--del_lnk--> sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders. The forelimbs are modified into wings.</p>
       <p>Like the <a href="../../wp/r/Reptile.htm" title="Reptile">reptiles</a>, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their <a href="../../wp/k/Kidney.htm" title="Kidney">kidneys</a> extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as <!--del_lnk--> uric acid instead of <a href="../../wp/u/Urea.htm" title="Urea">urea</a> or <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> via the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a <!--del_lnk--> urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ostrich.htm#Description" title="Ostrich">Ostrich</a>) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete <!--del_lnk--> creatine, rather than <!--del_lnk--> creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's <!--del_lnk--> cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, birds mate by <!--del_lnk--> joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate <!--del_lnk--> pellets. The <!--del_lnk--> digestive system of birds is unique, with a <!--del_lnk--> crop for storage and a <!--del_lnk--> gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.</p>
       <p>Birds have one of the most complex <!--del_lnk--> respiratory systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior <!--del_lnk--> air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the <!--del_lnk--> syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalizations and the perception of the bird's size. The bird's heart has four chambers like a mammalian heart. In birds the main arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right <!--del_lnk--> aortic arch (or pharyngeal arch), unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms this part of the <!--del_lnk--> aorta. The postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system. Unlike in mammals, the circulating <!--del_lnk--> red blood cells in birds retain their <!--del_lnk--> nucleus.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> nervous system is large relative to the bird's size. The most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the <a href="../../wp/c/Cerebellum.htm" title="Cerebellum">cerebellum</a> coordinates movement and the <!--del_lnk--> cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a poor <!--del_lnk--> sense of smell with notable exceptions including <!--del_lnk--> kiwis, <!--del_lnk--> New World vultures and <!--del_lnk--> tubenoses. The avian <!--del_lnk--> visual system is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual <!--del_lnk--> fovea. Birds are <!--del_lnk--> tetrachromatic, possessing <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> (UV) sensitive <!--del_lnk--> cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones. This allows them to perceive ultraviolet light, which is involved in courtship. Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> reflective patches on their feathers. Male <a href="../../wp/b/Blue_Tit.htm" title="Blue Tit">Blue Tits</a> have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging&mdash;<a href="../../wp/k/Kestrel.htm" title="Kestrel">kestrels</a> have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the <!--del_lnk--> nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a <a href="../../wp/c/Contact_lens.htm" title="Contact lens">contact lens</a> in many aquatic birds. The bird <a href="../../wp/r/Retina.htm" title="Retina">retina</a> has a fan shaped blood supply system called the <!--del_lnk--> pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Cormorant.htm" title="Great Cormorant">Great Cormorant</a>. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide <!--del_lnk--> visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have <!--del_lnk--> binocular vision and can estimate the <!--del_lnk--> depth of field. The avian <!--del_lnk--> ear lacks external <!--del_lnk--> pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Asio</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Bubo</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Otus</i> <a href="../../wp/o/Owl.htm" title="Owl">owls</a>, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The <!--del_lnk--> inner ear has a <!--del_lnk--> cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.</p>
       <p>A few species are able to use chemical defenses against predators; some <!--del_lnk--> Procellariiformes can eject an unpleasant <!--del_lnk--> oil against an aggressor, and some species of <!--del_lnk--> pitohuis from <!--del_lnk--> New Guinea have a powerful <!--del_lnk--> neurotoxin in their skin and feathers.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chromosomes">Chromosomes</span></h3>
       <p>Birds have two sexes: male and female. The sex of birds is determined by the <!--del_lnk--> Z and W sex chromosomes, rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals. Male birds have two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and female birds have a W chromosome and a Z chromosome (WZ).</p>
       <p>In nearly all species of birds, an individual's sex is determined at fertilization. However, one recent study demonstrated <!--del_lnk--> temperature-dependent sex determination among <!--del_lnk--> Australian Brush-turkeys, for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male <!--del_lnk--> sex ratio.</p>

       <p>Feathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in <!--del_lnk--> some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate <!--del_lnk--> flight, provide insulation that aids in <!--del_lnk--> thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signaling. There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called <!--del_lnk--> plumage, may vary within species by age, <!--del_lnk--> social status, and <!--del_lnk--> sex.</p>
       <p>Plumage is regularly <!--del_lnk--> moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the "non-breeding" plumage, or&mdash;in the <!--del_lnk--> Humphrey-Parkes terminology&mdash;"basic" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as "alternate" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, <!--del_lnk--> flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the <!--del_lnk--> Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of <!--del_lnk--> woodpeckers and <a href="../../wp/t/Treecreeper.htm" title="Treecreeper">treecreepers</a>, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in <!--del_lnk--> passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare <!--del_lnk--> brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily, spending an average of around 9% of their daily time on this. The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply <!--del_lnk--> waxy secretions from the <!--del_lnk--> uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and act as an <!--del_lnk--> antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>. This may be supplemented with the secretions of <a href="../../wp/f/Formic_acid.htm" title="Formic acid">formic acid</a> from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as <!--del_lnk--> anting, to remove feather parasites.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> scales of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs. They are found mainly on the toes and <!--del_lnk--> metatarsus, but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds. Most bird scales do not overlap significantly, except in the cases of <!--del_lnk--> kingfishers and <!--del_lnk--> woodpeckers.

       </div>
       <p>Most birds can <!--del_lnk--> fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (<!--del_lnk--> wing) that serves as an <!--del_lnk--> aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are <!--del_lnk--> flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to "fly" through the water, as do <!--del_lnk--> auks, <!--del_lnk--> shearwaters and <!--del_lnk--> dippers.</p>

       <p>Most birds are <!--del_lnk--> diurnal, but some birds, such as many species of <a href="../../wp/o/Owl.htm" title="Owl">owls</a> and <!--del_lnk--> nightjars, are <!--del_lnk--> nocturnal or <!--del_lnk--> crepuscular (active during twilight hours), and many coastal <a href="../../wp/w/Wader.htm" title="Wader">waders</a> feed when the tides are appropriate, by day or night.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Birds' diets are varied and often include <!--del_lnk--> nectar, fruit, plants, seeds, <!--del_lnk--> carrion, and various small animals, including other birds. Because birds have no teeth, their <!--del_lnk--> digestive system is adapted to process <!--del_lnk--> unmasticated food items that are swallowed whole.</p>
       <p>Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds <!--del_lnk--> glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek <!--del_lnk--> pest <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a> are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in <!--del_lnk--> biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as <!--del_lnk--> hummingbirds, <!--del_lnk--> sunbirds, <!--del_lnk--> lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit <!--del_lnk--> co-adapted flowers. <!--del_lnk--> Kiwis and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Wader.htm" title="Shorebird">shorebirds</a> with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of <!--del_lnk--> ecological niches. <!--del_lnk--> Loons, <!--del_lnk--> diving ducks, <a href="../../wp/p/Penguin.htm" title="Penguin">penguins</a> and <!--del_lnk--> auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as <!--del_lnk--> sulids, <!--del_lnk--> kingfishers and <a href="../../wp/t/Tern.htm" title="Tern">terns</a> plunge dive after their prey. <a href="../../wp/f/Flamingo.htm" title="Flamingo">Flamingos</a>, three species of <!--del_lnk--> prion, and some ducks are <!--del_lnk--> filter feeders. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Goose.htm" title="Geese">Geese</a> and <!--del_lnk--> dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.</p>
       <p>Some species, including <!--del_lnk--> frigatebirds, <a href="../../wp/g/Gull.htm" title="Gull">gulls</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> skuas, engage in <!--del_lnk--> kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of <!--del_lnk--> Great Frigatebirds stealing from <!--del_lnk--> Masked Boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%. Other birds are <!--del_lnk--> scavengers; some of these, like <a href="../../wp/v/Vulture.htm" title="Vulture">vultures</a>, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, <!--del_lnk--> corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water_and_drinking">Water and drinking</span></h3>
       <p>Water is needed by many birds although their mode of excretion and lack of <!--del_lnk--> sweat glands reduces the physiological demands. Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. They may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting. Seabirds can drink seawater and have <!--del_lnk--> salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils.</p>
       <p>Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat. Some species, especially of arid zones, belonging to the <a href="../../wp/c/Columbidae.htm" title="Columbidae">pigeon</a>, <!--del_lnk--> finch, <!--del_lnk--> mousebird, <!--del_lnk--> button-quail and <!--del_lnk--> bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and <!--del_lnk--> sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called <!--del_lnk--> crop milk that they provide to their chicks.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feather_care">Feather care</span></h3>
       <p>Feathers being critical to the survival of a bird, require maintenance. Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and <!--del_lnk--> birdlice. The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland. Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as <!--del_lnk--> anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers. Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Migration">Migration</span></h3>
       <p>Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of <a href="../../wp/s/Season.htm" title="Season">seasonal</a> temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Wader.htm" title="Shorebird">shorebirds</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the <!--del_lnk--> temperate or <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">arctic</a>/<!--del_lnk--> antarctic regions and a non-breeding season in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tropics.htm" title="Tropical">tropical</a> regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs. Migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling. Landbirds have a flight range of around 2,500&nbsp;km (1,600&nbsp;mi) and shorebirds can fly up to 4,000&nbsp;km (2,500&nbsp;mi), although the <!--del_lnk--> Bar-tailed Godwit is capable of non-stop flights of up to 10,200&nbsp;km (6,300&nbsp;mi). <!--del_lnk--> Seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of <!--del_lnk--> Sooty Shearwaters, which nest in <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a> and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, <!--del_lnk--> Alaska and <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>, an annual round trip of 64,000&nbsp;km (39,800&nbsp;mi). Other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route. Albatrosses nesting in the <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Ocean.htm" title="Southern Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. <!--del_lnk--> Irruptive species such as the boreal <!--del_lnk--> finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next. This type of migration is normally associated with food availability. Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates. Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory. Altitudinal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes elevations and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when <!--del_lnk--> the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. <!--del_lnk--> Parrots as a <!--del_lnk--> family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.</p>
       <p>The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a <!--del_lnk--> Manx Shearwater released in <a href="../../wp/b/Boston.htm" title="Boston">Boston</a> returned to its colony in <!--del_lnk--> Skomer, <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, within 13 days, a distance of 5,150&nbsp;km (3,200&nbsp;mi). Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For <!--del_lnk--> diurnal migrants, the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a> is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an <!--del_lnk--> internal clock. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the <!--del_lnk--> constellations surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Polaris. These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's <!--del_lnk--> geomagnetism through specialised <!--del_lnk--> photoreceptors.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Birds <!--del_lnk--> communicate using primarily visual and auditory signals. Signals can be interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species).</p>
       <p>Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the <!--del_lnk--> Sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off <a href="../../wp/h/Hawk.htm" title="Hawk">hawks</a> and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where "dances" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.</p>

Calls are used for a variety of purposes, including mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication.

       <p>While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large <!--del_lnk--> flocks. The principal benefits of flocking are <!--del_lnk--> safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency. Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where <!--del_lnk--> ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This has led to the development of many <!--del_lnk--> mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources. Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times. Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening "peeks", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats. <a href="../../wp/s/Swift.htm" title="Swift">Swifts</a> are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight. It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight. Some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into <!--del_lnk--> slow-wave sleep one <!--del_lnk--> hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for <!--del_lnk--> predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from <!--del_lnk--> marine mammals. Communal roosting is common because it lowers the <!--del_lnk--> loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.</p>
       <p>Many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their <!--del_lnk--> bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. <!--del_lnk--> Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Loriculus</i> roost hanging upside down. Some <!--del_lnk--> hummingbirds go into a nightly state of <!--del_lnk--> torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This <!--del_lnk--> physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including <!--del_lnk--> owlet-nightjars, <!--del_lnk--> nightjars, and <!--del_lnk--> woodswallows. One species, the <!--del_lnk--> Common Poorwill, even enters a state of <!--del_lnk--> hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like <!--del_lnk--> urohidrosis to cool themselves.</p>

       <p>Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or&mdash;in some cases&mdash;for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for <!--del_lnk--> biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other <a href="../../wp/a/Anatidae.htm" title="Anatidae">anatids</a>. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.</p>
       <p>Other mating systems, including <!--del_lnk--> polygyny, <!--del_lnk--> polyandry, <!--del_lnk--> polygamy, <!--del_lnk--> polygynandry, and <!--del_lnk--> promiscuity, also occur. Polygamous breeding systems arise when females are able to raise broods without the help of males. Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.</p>
       <p>Breeding usually involves some form of courtship display, typically performed by the male. Most displays are rather simple and involve some type of <!--del_lnk--> song. Some displays, however, are quite elaborate. Depending on the species, these may include wing or tail drumming, dancing, aerial flights, or communal <!--del_lnk--> lekking. Females are generally the ones that drive partner selection, although in the polyandrous <!--del_lnk--> phalaropes, this is reversed: plainer males choose brightly coloured females. <!--del_lnk--> Courtship feeding, <!--del_lnk--> billing and allopreening are commonly performed between partners, generally after the birds have paired and mated.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Homosexual behaviour has been observed in males or females in numerous species of birds, including copulation, pair-bonding, and joint parenting of chicks.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Territories.2C_nesting_and_incubation">Territories, nesting and incubation</span></h4>
       <p>Many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as <!--del_lnk--> seabirds and <a href="../../wp/s/Swift.htm" title="Swift">swifts</a>, often breed in <!--del_lnk--> colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.</p>
       <p>All birds lay <!--del_lnk--> amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium_carbonate.htm" title="Calcium carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay <!--del_lnk--> camouflaged eggs. There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting <!--del_lnk--> nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of <!--del_lnk--> brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.</p>

       <p>Bird eggs are usually laid in a <!--del_lnk--> nest. Most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; <a href="../../wp/a/Albatross.htm" title="Albatross">albatross</a> nests are no more than a scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds&mdash;which are more capable of defence&mdash;may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation. Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting <!--del_lnk--> Common Guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male <a href="../../wp/e/Emperor_Penguin.htm" title="Emperor Penguin">Emperor Penguins</a> keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are <!--del_lnk--> precocial.</p>

       <p>Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through <!--del_lnk--> brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9&nbsp;oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of <!--del_lnk--> megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in <!--del_lnk--> woodpeckers, <!--del_lnk--> cuckoos and <!--del_lnk--> passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and <!--del_lnk--> kiwis).</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Parental_care_and_fledging">Parental care and fledging</span></h4>
       <p>At the time of their hatching, chicks range in development from helpless to independent, depending on their species. Helpless chicks are termed <i><!--del_lnk--> altricial</i>, and tend to be born small, <a href="../../wp/b/Blindness.htm" title="Blindness">blind</a>, immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed <i><!--del_lnk--> precocial</i>. Altricial chicks need help <!--del_lnk--> thermoregulating and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. Chicks at neither of these extremes can be semi-precocial or semi-altricial.</p>

       <p>The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in <!--del_lnk--> megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Frigatebird, whose chicks take up to six months to <!--del_lnk--> fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. The <i>chick guard stage</i> describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.</p>
       <p>In some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex. In some species, <!--del_lnk--> other members of the same species&mdash;usually close relatives of the <!--del_lnk--> breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods&mdash;will help with the raising of the young. Such alloparenting is particularly common among the <!--del_lnk--> Corvida, which includes such birds as the true <!--del_lnk--> crows, <!--del_lnk--> Australian Magpie and <!--del_lnk--> Fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species as different as the <!--del_lnk--> Rifleman and <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Kite.htm" title="Red Kite">Red Kite</a>. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common&mdash;more so than in any other vertebrate class. Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a <!--del_lnk--> division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.</p>
       <p>The point at which chicks <!--del_lnk--> fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Synthliboramphus</i> murrelets, like the <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging. Chicks may also follow their parents during their first <a href="../../wp/b/Bird_migration.htm" title="Bird migration">migration</a>.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Brood parasitism, in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism. After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either <i>obligate brood parasites</i>, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or <i>non-obligate brood parasites</i>, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of <!--del_lnk--> conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including <!--del_lnk--> honeyguides, <!--del_lnk--> icterids, <!--del_lnk--> estrildid finches and <!--del_lnk--> ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the <!--del_lnk--> cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
       <p>Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the <!--del_lnk--> niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the <!--del_lnk--> forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be <!--del_lnk--> insectivores, <!--del_lnk--> frugivores, and <!--del_lnk--> nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or <!--del_lnk--> kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised <!--del_lnk--> scavengers. <!--del_lnk--> Avivores are animals that are specialized at predating birds.</p>
       <p>Some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal. Plants and pollinating birds often <!--del_lnk--> coevolve, and in some cases a flower's primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.</p>
       <p>Birds are often important to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfill ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the <!--del_lnk--> moas were important browsers, as are the <!--del_lnk--> Kereru and <!--del_lnk--> Kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa. Nesting <!--del_lnk--> seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of <!--del_lnk--> guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.</p>
       <p>A wide variety of <!--del_lnk--> Avian ecology field methods, including counts, nest monitoring, and capturing and marking, are used for researching avian ecology.</p>

Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a> incorporated <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Common_Nightingale.htm" title="Nightingale">Nightingales</a> into his <i><a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>, and <!--del_lnk--> Catullus used a <a href="../../wp/s/Sparrow.htm" title="Sparrow">sparrow</a> as an erotic symbol in his <!--del_lnk--> Catullus 2. The relationship between an <a href="../../wp/a/Albatross.htm" title="Albatross">albatross</a> and a sailor is the central theme of <a href="../../wp/s/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge.htm" title="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>'s <a href="../../wp/t/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner.htm" title="The Rime of the Ancient Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>, which led to the use of the <!--del_lnk--> term as a metaphor for a 'burden'. Other <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> metaphors derive from birds; <!--del_lnk--> vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.</p>
       <p>Perceptions of various bird species often vary across cultures. <a href="../../wp/o/Owl.htm" title="Owl">Owls</a> are associated with bad luck, <!--del_lnk--> witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. <!--del_lnk--> Hoopoes were considered sacred in <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and symbols of virtue in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Persia">Persia</a>, but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe and harbingers of war in <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia.</p>

       <p>Though human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Barn Swallow and <!--del_lnk--> European Starling, they have caused population decreases or <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinction</a> in many other species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750&ndash;1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of <!--del_lnk--> Melanesian, <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian, and <!--del_lnk--> Micronesian islands. Many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as <!--del_lnk--> threatened by <!--del_lnk--> Birdlife International and the <!--del_lnk--> IUCN in 2009.</p>
       <p>The most commonly cited human threat to birds is <!--del_lnk--> habitat loss. Other threats include overhunting, accidental mortality due to <!--del_lnk--> structural collisions or <!--del_lnk--> long-line fishing <!--del_lnk--> bycatch, pollution (including <!--del_lnk--> oil spills and pesticide use), competition and predation from nonnative <a href="../../wp/i/Invasive_species.htm" title="Invasive species">invasive species</a>, and climate change.</p>
       <p>Governments and <!--del_lnk--> conservation groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that <!--del_lnk--> preserve and <!--del_lnk--> restore bird habitat or by establishing <!--del_lnk--> captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the <!--del_lnk--> California Condor and <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk Parakeet.<br style="clear:both;" />
