       <p><b>Bo</b> is the second largest <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> in <a href="../../wp/s/Sierra_Leone.htm" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a> (after the capital, <a href="../../wp/f/Freetown.htm" title="Freetown">Freetown</a>) and the largest city in southeastern Sierra Leone. The city is located in the Southern Province and lies 155 miles (249&nbsp;km) (by road) south-east of <a href="../../wp/f/Freetown.htm" title="Freetown">Freetown</a>. The city serve as the capital and administrative centre of <!--del_lnk--> Bo District. After Freetown, Bo is the leading educational, transportational, commercial and cultural centre of Sierra Leone, with a current population of 215,474 <!--del_lnk--> .</p>
       <p>The population of the city is ethnically and culturally diverse. The city is home to a significant number of virtually all of the country's ethnic group, though the <!--del_lnk--> Mende people make up the largest ethnic group. Like in virtually all parts of Sierra Leone, the <!--del_lnk--> Krio language is the most widely spoken language in Bo and is used as the primary language of communication in the city.</p>
       <p>The city is the primary home of <!--del_lnk--> Njala University, the second largest university in Sierra Leone, after the <!--del_lnk--> Fourah Bay College in Freetown. The city is home to the <!--del_lnk--> Christ the King College, one of the most prominent colleges in Sierra Leone. Bo is also home to the <!--del_lnk--> The Bo Government Secondary School (commonly known as Bo School), which is one of the biggest and most prominent secondary schools in Sierra Leone. The school not only attract students from all parts of Sierra Leone, but also attract <!--del_lnk--> international students from other <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/West_Africa.htm" title="West African">West African</a> nations. The school has a history of producing some of Sierra Leon's most gifted students, including some of the country's senior <!--del_lnk--> politicians.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>Centrally located, Bo lies on the main <!--del_lnk--> rail line east and south of <a href="../../wp/f/Freetown.htm" title="Freetown">Freetown</a> which was closed in 1974. From 1930 until <!--del_lnk--> independence 1961, it was the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Protectorate of Sierra Leone. The city is the administrative centre of the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Province. After Freetown, Bo is the leading transportation, commercial, and educational center of Sierra Leone. Bo began its modern development with the coming of the railroad in 1889 and became an educational centre in 1906, when the Bo Government Secondary School was established.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> inhabitants of Bo are known for their resolve, resistance and <!--del_lnk--> hospitality. The town was named after its generosity. An <a href="../../wp/e/Elephant.htm" title="Elephant">elephant</a> was killed close to what is now known as Bo Parking Ground. People from the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> villages came to receive their share. Because the meat was so large, the <!--del_lnk--> hunter spent days distributing it and the words "Bo- lor" (which in <!--del_lnk--> Mende language means "this is yours," with reference to the meat) was said so much that the elders and visitors decided to name the place Bo. "Bo-lor" in Mende also <!--del_lnk--> translates to "this is Bo."</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Government">Government</span></h2>
       <p>The city of Bo is governed with a <!--del_lnk--> city council form of government, which is headed by a <!--del_lnk--> mayor, in whom <!--del_lnk--> executive authority is vested. The mayor is responsible for the general management of the city and for seeing that all laws are enforced. The mayor is elected directly by the people of Bo. The current mayor of Bo is <!--del_lnk--> Wusu Sannoh, he is a member of the opposition <!--del_lnk--> Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP). The city and the entire Bo District is a stronghold of the opposition Sierra Leone People's Party. In the second round of the 2007 Sierra Leone presidential election, the <!--del_lnk--> incumbent vice president of Sierra Leone <!--del_lnk--> Solomon Berewa and candidate of the then ruling SLPP party got 67% of the vote in Bo District, while the leader of the main <!--del_lnk--> opposition party and current president of Sierra Leone <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Bai Koroma of the <!--del_lnk--> All People's Congress (APC) got 30% of the vote in the second round in the district.</p>

       <p>In 1981 Bo District formed 'One World Link' (OWL) (see <!--del_lnk--> UKOWLA) with <!--del_lnk--> Warwick District and <!--del_lnk--> Leamington Spa in the UK. This was inspired by a desire for justice, equality, human understanding and mutual support. Over the years it has helped to strengthen both communities and their awareness of global and development issues. The many outcomes of the link include women's groups, school links, an online archive, an education programme and the opening, in 2008, of a Community Centre in Bo city. Immediate plans include collaboration on a pilot environmental programme for the collection and disposal of waste. There is also a youth wing which has 20 registered youth groups, that serve over 1000 young people.</p>
       <p>The Bo District Development Association (BODDA - UK) was formed in the United Kingdom on 7th September 2003 by a group of natives from Bo District in Sierra Leone.
