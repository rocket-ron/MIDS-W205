       <p><i><b>Ben-Hur</b></i> (or <i><b>Benhur</b></i>) is a 1959 <!--del_lnk--> epic film directed by <!--del_lnk--> William Wyler, the third film version of <!--del_lnk--> Lew Wallace's 1880 novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ</i>. It premiered at <!--del_lnk--> Loew's State Theatre in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> on November 18, 1959. The film went on to win a record of eleven <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Academy_Award.htm" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a>, including <!--del_lnk--> Best Picture, a feat equaled only by <i><a href="../../wp/t/Titanic_%25281997_film%2529.htm" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a></i> in 1998 and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</i> in 2004. It was also the last film to win the Oscar for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, until nearly 44 years later when <i><!--del_lnk--> Mystic River</i> achieved the same feat.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
       <p>The film's prologue depicts the traditional story of the <!--del_lnk--> Nativity of Jesus Christ.</p>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a> 26, Prince Judah Ben-Hur (<!--del_lnk--> Charlton Heston) is a wealthy merchant in <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. His childhood friend Messala (<!--del_lnk--> Stephen Boyd), now a <!--del_lnk--> military tribune, arrives as the new commanding officer of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman garrison. Ben-Hur and Messala are happy to reunite after years apart, but politics divide them; Messala believes in the glory of <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Rome and its imperial power</a>, while Ben-Hur is devoted to his faith and the freedom of the Jewish people. Messala asks Ben-Hur for names of Jews who criticize the Roman government; Ben-Hur counsels his countrymen against rebellion but refuses to name names, and the two part in anger.</p>
       <p>Ben-Hur, his mother Miriam (<!--del_lnk--> Martha Scott), and sister Tirzah (<!--del_lnk--> Cathy O'Donnell) welcome their loyal slave Simonides (<!--del_lnk--> Sam Jaffe) and his daughter Esther (<!--del_lnk--> Haya Harareet), who is preparing for an arranged marriage. Ben-Hur gives Esther her freedom as a wedding present, and the two realize they are attracted to each other.</p>
       <p>During the parade for new <!--del_lnk--> governor of <!--del_lnk--> Judea <!--del_lnk--> Valerius Gratus, a tile falls from the roof of Ben-Hur's house and startles the governor's horse, which throws Gratus off, nearly killing him. Although Messala knows it was an accident, he condemns Ben-Hur to the <!--del_lnk--> galleys, and imprisons his mother and sister, to intimidate the restive Jewish populace by punishing the family of a known friend and prominent citizen. Ben-Hur swears to return and take revenge. En route to the sea, he is denied water when his slave gang arrives at <!--del_lnk--> Nazareth. Ben-Hur collapses in despair, but a local carpenter named Jesus gives him water and renews his will to survive.</p>
       <p>After three years as a galley slave, Ben-Hur is assigned to the flagship of <!--del_lnk--> Consul Quintus Arrius (<!--del_lnk--> Jack Hawkins), assigned to destroy a fleet of Macedonian <!--del_lnk--> pirates. The commander notices the slave's self-discipline and resolve and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer, but Ben-Hur declines, declaring that God will aid him.</p>
       <p>As Arrius prepares for battle, he orders the rowers chained but Ben-Hur to be left free. Arrius's galley is rammed and sunk, but Ben-Hur unchains other rowers, escapes and saves Arrius's life and, since Arrius believes the battle ended in defeat, prevents him from <a href="../../wp/s/Suicide.htm#Dutiful_suicide" title="Suicide">committing suicide</a>. Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory, and in gratitude petitions <!--del_lnk--> Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus (<!--del_lnk--> George Relph) to drop all charges against Ben-Hur, <!--del_lnk--> adopting him as his son. With regained freedom and wealth, Ben-Hur learns <!--del_lnk--> Roman ways and becomes a champion <!--del_lnk--> charioteer, but longs for his family and homeland.</p>
       <p>While returning to Judea, Ben-Hur meets <!--del_lnk--> Balthasar (<!--del_lnk--> Finlay Currie) and his host, Arab sheik Ilderim (<!--del_lnk--> Hugh Griffith), who owns four magnificent white <!--del_lnk--> Arabian horses. Ilderim introduces Ben-Hur to his "children" and asks him to drive Ilderim's <!--del_lnk--> quadriga in the upcoming race before the new Judean governor, <!--del_lnk--> Pontius Pilate (<!--del_lnk--> Frank Thring). Ben-Hur declines, but hears that champion charioteer Messala will compete; as Ilderim observes, "There is no law in the arena. Many are killed."</p>
       <p>Ben-Hur learns that Esther's arranged marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands that he free his mother and sister, but the Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah contracted <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Leprosy.htm" title="Leper">leprosy</a> during their five years in prison and expel them from the city. They beg Esther to conceal their condition from Ben-Hur, so she tells him that his mother and sister have died in prison.</p>
       <p>Ben-Hur enters the race. Messala drives a "peaked chariot," with blades on the hubs, designed to tear apart competing chariots. In the violent and grueling race, Messala attempts to destroy Ben-Hur's chariot but destroys his own instead; Messala is trampled and almost killed, while Ben-Hur wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Ben-Hur that "the race is not over" and that he can find his mother and sister "...in the Valley of the Lepers, if you can recognize them."</p>
       <p>The film is subtitled "A Tale of the Christ", and it is at this point that Jesus Christ reappears. Esther is moved by the <a href="../../wp/s/Sermon_on_the_Mount.htm" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>. She tells Ben-Hur about it, but he will not be consoled; blaming Roman rule &mdash; not Messala &mdash; for his family's fate, Ben-Hur rejects his <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">patrimony</a> and <!--del_lnk--> citizenship, and plans <!--del_lnk--> violence against the Empire. Learning that Tirzah is dying, Ben-Hur and Esther take her and Miriam to see Jesus Christ, but they cannot get near him; <!--del_lnk--> his trial has begun, with Pilate washing his hands of responsibility for Jesus Christ's fate. Recognizing Jesus Christ from their earlier meeting, Ben-Hur attempts to give him water during his <!--del_lnk--> march to <!--del_lnk--> Calvary but guards pull them apart.</p>
       <p>Ben-Hur witnesses the <!--del_lnk--> Crucifixion. Miriam and Tirzah are healed by a miracle, as are Ben-Hur's heart and soul. He tells Esther that as he heard Jesus Christ talk of forgiveness while on the cross, "I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand." The film ends with the empty crosses of Calvary and a <!--del_lnk--> shepherd and his flock.</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Music">Music</span></h2>
       <p>The film score was composed and conducted by <!--del_lnk--> Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;zsa, who scored most of MGM's epics. R&oacute;zsa won his third Academy Award for his work on the film. The soundtrack is one of the most popular motion picture scores ever written, and is listed on the AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores. The entire two-and-a-half hour score has been issued on a 2-CD <!--del_lnk--> Rhino Entertainment set.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Financing">Financing</span></h3>
       <p><i>Ben-Hur</i> was an extremely expensive production, requiring 300 sets scattered over 340 acres (1.4&nbsp;km&sup2;). The $15 million production was a gamble made by <!--del_lnk--> MGM to save itself from bankruptcy; the gamble paid off when it earned a total of $90 million worldwide.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aspect_ratio">Aspect ratio</span></h3>
       <p>The movie was filmed in a process known as "<!--del_lnk--> MGM Camera 65", 65&nbsp;mm negative stock from which was made a 70&nbsp;mm <!--del_lnk--> anamorphic print with an aspect ratio of 2.76:1, one of the widest prints ever made, having a width of almost three times its height. An anamorphic lens which produced a 1.25X compression was used along with a 65&nbsp;mm negative (whose normal aspect ratio was 2.20:1) to produce this extremely wide aspect ratio. This allowed for spectacular panoramic shots in addition to six-channel audio. In practice, however, "Camera 65" prints were shown in an aspect ratio of 2.5:1 on most screens, so that theaters were not required to install new, wider screens or use less than the full height of screens already installed.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Casting_and_acting">Casting and acting</span></h3>
       <p>Many other actors were offered the role of Ben-Hur before <!--del_lnk--> Charlton Heston. <!--del_lnk--> Burt Lancaster claimed he turned down the role of Ben-Hur because he "didn't like the violent morals in the story". <!--del_lnk--> Paul Newman turned it down because he said he didn't have the legs to wear a tunic. <!--del_lnk--> Rock Hudson and <!--del_lnk--> Leslie Nielsen were also offered the role.</p>
       <p>Out of respect, and consistent with Lew Wallace's stated preference, the face of Jesus is not shown. He was played by opera singer Claude Heater, who received no credit for his only film role.</p>
       <p>In an interview for the 1995 documentary <i><!--del_lnk--> The Celluloid Closet</i>, screenwriter <!--del_lnk--> Gore Vidal asserts that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to create a veiled homoerotic subtext between Messala and Ben-Hur. Vidal says he wanted to help explain Messala's extreme reaction to Ben-Hur's refusal to name his fellow Jews to a Roman officer, and suggested to Wyler that Messala and Ben-Hur had been homosexual lovers while growing up, but that Ben-Hur was no longer interested, so that Messala's vindictiveness would be motivated by his feeling of rejection. Since the Hollywood <!--del_lnk--> production code would not permit this, the idea would have to be implied by the actors, and Vidal suggested to Wyler that he direct <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Boyd to play the role that way, but not tell Heston. Vidal claims that Wyler took his advice, and that the results can be seen in the film.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Galley_sequence">Galley sequence</span></h3>
       <p>The original design for the boat Ben-Hur is enslaved upon was so heavy that it couldn't float. The scene therefore had to be filmed in a studio, but another problem remained: the cameras didn't fit inside, so the boat was cut in half and made able to be wider or narrower on demand. The next problem was that the oars were too long, so those were cut too; however, this made it look unrealistic, because the oars were too easy to row; so weights were added to the ends.</p>
       <p>During filming, director Wyler noticed that one of the extras was missing a hand. He had the man's stump covered in false blood, with a false bone protruding from it, to add realism to the scene when the galley is rammed. Wyler made similar use of another extra who was missing a foot.</p>
       <p>The galley sequence includes the successive commands from Arrius, &ldquo;Battle speed, Hortator... Attack speed... Ramming speed!&rdquo; The word <i><!--del_lnk--> hortator</i> is no longer in use, and is notably absent from most modern dictionaries. It was a Latin word that on a ship meant &ldquo;chief of the rowers&rdquo;, or &ldquo;he who has command over the rowers&rdquo;, and likely has roots in the Latin verb <i><!--del_lnk--> hortor</i> (&ldquo;to exhort, encourage&rdquo;). The command "Ramming speed, Hortator!", which is widely remembered and parodied, never occurs.</p>
       <p>The galley sequence is purely fictional, as the <!--del_lnk--> Roman navy, in contrast to its early modern counterparts, did not employ convicts as <!--del_lnk--> galley slaves.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chariot_race">Chariot race</span></h3>
       <p>The chariot race in <i>Ben-Hur</i> was directed by <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Marton, a Hollywood director who often acted as second unit director on other people's films. Even by current standards, it is considered to be one of the most spectacular action sequences ever filmed. Filmed at <!--del_lnk--> Cinecitt&agrave; Studios outside <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> long before the advent of <!--del_lnk--> computer-generated effects, it took over three months to complete, using 15,000 extras on the largest film set ever built, some 18 acres (73,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>). Eighteen chariots were built, with half being used for practice. The race took five weeks to film. Tour buses visited the set every hour.</p>
       <p>The section in the middle of the <!--del_lnk--> circus, the <i>spina,</i> is a known feature of circuses, although its size may be exaggerated to aid filmmaking. The golden dolphin lap counter was a feature of the <!--del_lnk--> Circus Maximus in Rome.</p>

       <p>Charlton Heston spent four weeks learning how to drive a chariot. He was taught by the stunt crew, who offered to teach the entire cast, but Heston and Boyd were the only ones who took them up on the offer (Boyd had to learn in just two weeks, due to his late casting). At the beginning of the chariot race, Heston shook the reins and nothing happened; Aldebaran, Alta&iuml;r, Antares and Rigel, the four horses named after celestial stars, remained motionless. Finally someone way up on top of the set yelled, "Giddy-up!" The horses then roared into action, and Heston was flung backward off the chariot.</p>
       <p>To give the scene more impact and realism, three lifelike dummies were placed at key points in the race to give the appearance of men being run over by chariots. Most notable is the stand-in dummy for Stephen Boyd's Messala that gets tangled up under the horses, getting battered by their hooves. This resulted in one of the most grisly fatal injuries in motion picture history up until then, and shocked audiences.</p>
       <p>There are several <!--del_lnk--> urban legends surrounding the chariot sequence, one of which states that a stuntman died during filming. Stuntman <!--del_lnk--> Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, "We had a stunt man killed in the third week, and it happened right in front of me. You saw it, too, because the cameras kept turning and it's in the movie". There is no conclusive evidence to back up Powell's claim and it has been adamantly denied by director William Wyler, who states that neither man nor horse was injured in the famous scene. The movie's stunt director, <!--del_lnk--> Yakima Canutt, stated that no serious injuries or deaths occurred during filming.</p>
       <p>Another urban legend states that a red <!--del_lnk--> Ferrari can be seen during the chariot race; the book <i>Movie Mistakes</i> claims this is a myth. (Heston, in the DVD commentary track, mentions a third urban legend that is not true: That he wore a wristwatch. He points out that he was wearing leather bracers right up to the elbow.)</p>
       <p>However, one of the best-remembered moments in the race came from a near-fatal accident. When Judah's chariot jumps another chariot which has crashed in its path, the charioteer is seen to be almost thrown from his mount and only just manages to hang on and climb back in to continue the race. In reality, while the jump was planned, the character being flipped into the air was not planned, and stuntman Joe Canutt, son of stunt director <!--del_lnk--> Yakima Canutt, was considered fortunate to escape with only a minor chin injury. Nonetheless, when director Wyler intercut the long shot of Canutt's leap with a close-up of Heston clambering back into his chariot, a memorable scene resulted.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_between_novel_and_film">Differences between novel and film</span></h2>
       <p>There are several differences between the original novel and the film. The changes made serve to make the film's storyline more immediately dramatic.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>In the novel, Messala is seriously, but not fatally, injured in the chariot race. In the movie, Messala falls victim to an accident that is caused by his own attempts to sabotage Ben-Hur, and he dies from the wounds sustained from the accident. In the book, Messala plots to have Ben-Hur murdered in revenge, but his plans go awry. It is revealed at the end of the novel that Iras (who is Messala's mistress and does not appear in the 1959 film) had murdered Messala in a fit of anger about five years after the chariot race.</li>
        <li>The film has the chariot race taking place in <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, the novel however has it taking place in <!--del_lnk--> Antioch.</li>
        <li>In the novel, Ben-Hur becomes a convert to Christianity before, rather than after, the Crucifixion, and he does not display the harsh bitterness that he does in the William Wyler film. Similarly, the healing of Ben-Hur's mother and sister takes place earlier in the book, not immediately after the death of Christ.</li>
        <li>In the novel, the character of Quintus Arrius was acquainted with Ben-Hur's father, but in the movie there was no such prior association between the Arrius and Hur families. In the novel, Arrius dies and passes his property and title on to Ben-Hur prior to Ben-Hur's return home. No mention of Arrius's death is made in the 1959 film, so presumably he is still alive at film's end.</li>
        <li>The novel ends about 30 years after the chariot race, with the Ben-Hur family living in <!--del_lnk--> Misenum, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>. While in <!--del_lnk--> Antioch, Ben-Hur learns that Sheik Ilderim (who does not die in any of the film versions of the novel) had bequeathed him a large amount of money. At about the same time he learns of the persecution of Christians in Rome by <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Nero, Ben-Hur helps establish the <!--del_lnk--> Catacomb of San Calixto so that the Christian community will have a place to worship freely. The movie, however, ends almost immediately after the Crucifixion of Christ and the healing of Ben-Hur's mother and sister. This is presumably only a few years after the chariot race, not thirty years afterward. None of the characters (except Balthasar, who appears in the Nativity Scene) is shown to age in the film.</li>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="First_telecast">First telecast</span></h2>
       <p>The film's first telecast took place on Sunday, February 14, 1971. The film was shown in full-screen <!--del_lnk--> pan and scan format, as a prime time network television special on <!--del_lnk--> CBS. Because of the film's length, the entire evening's regular CBS lineup, beginning with <i><!--del_lnk--> 60 Minutes</i>, was scrapped for just that one night, one of the few times in the history of CBS that <i>60 Minutes</i> was preempted for a movie special. The commercials forced a five-hour running time on the film, which was shown between 7:00 P.M. and 12:00 A.M., E.S.T.</p>
