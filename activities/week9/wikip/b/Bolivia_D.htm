<p><strong>Description of SOS Social Centre/FSP: </strong></p>
<p>The SOS Social Centre opened in 1996 and comprises a day-care centre for up to 140 children, and a small health-care centre. Six group rooms, a treatment room, a seminar room for further education and additional rooms are available. The SOS Social Centre is also available to the public and hence makes an important contribution towards improving living conditions in the neighbourhood.
