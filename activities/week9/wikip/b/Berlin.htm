With a population of 3.5&nbsp;million people, Berlin is Germany's largest city and is the second <!--del_lnk--> most populous city proper and the ninth <!--del_lnk--> most populous urban area in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>. Located in northeastern Germany on the River <!--del_lnk--> Spree, it is the centre of the <!--del_lnk--> Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 4&frac12; million residents from over 180 nations. Due to its location in the <!--del_lnk--> European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a <!--del_lnk--> temperate seasonal climate. Around one third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.</p>
       <p>First documented in the 13th century, Berlin was the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Prussia (1701&ndash;1918), the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire (1871&ndash;1918), the <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> (1919&ndash;33) and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> (1933&ndash;45). <!--del_lnk--> Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world. After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the city became divided into <!--del_lnk--> East Berlin&mdash;the capital of <!--del_lnk--> East Germany&mdash;and <!--del_lnk--> West Berlin, a <!--del_lnk--> West German <!--del_lnk--> exclave surrounded by the <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> from 1961&ndash;89. Following <a href="../../wp/g/German_reunification.htm" title="German reunification">German reunification</a> in 1990, the city regained its status as the capital of Germany, hosting 147 foreign embassies.</p>
       <p>Berlin is a world city of culture, politics, media, and science. Its economy is primarily based on the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of <!--del_lnk--> creative industries, media corporations, and convention venues. Berlin also serves as a continental hub for air and rail transport, and is a popular tourist destination. Significant industries include IT, pharmaceuticals, biomedical engineering, biotechnology, electronics, traffic engineering, and renewable energy.</p>
       <p>Berlin is home to renowned universities, research institutes, orchestras, museums, and celebrities, as well as host of many sporting events. Its urban settings and historical legacy have made it a popular location for international <!--del_lnk--> film productions. The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts, public transportation networks and a <!--del_lnk--> high quality of living.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>The origin of the name <i>Berlin</i> is unknown, but it may have its roots in the language of <!--del_lnk--> West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and be related to the Old <!--del_lnk--> Polabian stem <i>berl-</i>/<i>birl-</i> ("swamp"). <!--del_lnk--> Folk etymology connects it to the German <i>B&auml;r</i>, a bear, and a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.</p>

       <p>The earliest evidence of settlements in the area of today's Berlin are a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192 and leftovers of wooden houseparts dated to 1174 found in a 2012 digging in Berlin Mitte. The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. <!--del_lnk--> Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;penick in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920. The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. <!--del_lnk--> C&ouml;lln on the <!--del_lnk--> Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the <!--del_lnk--> Spree in what is now called the <!--del_lnk--> Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244. The former (1237) is considered to be the founding date of the city. The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties and eventually merged in 1307 and came to be known as <i>Berlin</i>.</p>
       <p>In 1435, <!--del_lnk--> Frederick I became the <!--del_lnk--> elector of the <!--del_lnk--> Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440. His successor, <!--del_lnk--> Frederick II Irontooth, established Berlin as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the <!--del_lnk--> Hohenzollern family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as <!--del_lnk--> German emperors. In 1448, citizens rebelled in the "Berlin Indignation" against the construction of a new royal palace by Frederick II Irontooth. This protest was not successful, however, and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. In 1451 Berlin became the royal residence of the Brandenburg electors, and Berlin had to give up its status as a free <!--del_lnk--> Hanseatic city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population. <!--del_lnk--> Frederick William, known as the "Great Elector", who had succeeded his father <!--del_lnk--> George William as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance. With the <!--del_lnk--> Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French <!--del_lnk--> Huguenots. More than 15,000 Huguenots went to Brandenburg, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. By 1700, approximately 20 percent of Berlin's residents were French, and their cultural influence on the city was immense. Many other immigrants came from <!--del_lnk--> Bohemia, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Polish%25E2%2580%2593Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Poland</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Salzburg.</p>

       </div>
       <p>With the coronation of <!--del_lnk--> Frederick I in 1701 as king (in <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;nigsberg), Berlin became the new capital of the Kingdom of Prussia (instead of K&ouml;nigsberg); this was a successful attempt to centralize the capital in the very outspread Prussian Kingdom, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1740, Frederick II, known as <a href="../../wp/f/Frederick_the_Great.htm" title="Frederick the Great">Frederick the Great</a> (1740&ndash;1786), came to power. Under the rule of Frederick II Berlin became a centre of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="The Enlightenment">the Enlightenment</a>. Following <!--del_lnk--> France's victory in the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Fourth Coalition, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Napoleon.htm" title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. In 1815 the city became part of the new <!--del_lnk--> Province of Brandenburg.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main rail hub and economic centre of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, outlying suburbs including <!--del_lnk--> Wedding, <!--del_lnk--> Moabit, and several others were incorporated into Berlin. In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded German Empire. On 1 April 1881 it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.</p>

       <p>At the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> in 1918, a <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">republic</a> was proclaimed in Berlin. In 1920, the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. This new area encompassed Spandau and <!--del_lnk--> Charlottenburg in the west, as well as several other areas that are now major municipalities. After this expansion, Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin became internationally renowned as a centre of cultural transformation, at the heart of the <!--del_lnk--> Roaring Twenties.</p>
       <p>On 30 January 1933, <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Nazi Party <!--del_lnk--> came to power. Nazi rule destroyed Berlin's Jewish community, which had numbered 170,000 before 1933. After <!--del_lnk--> Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Sachsenhausen concentration camp or, in early 1943, were shipped to <!--del_lnk--> death camps, such as <!--del_lnk--> Auschwitz. During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in <!--del_lnk--> the 1943&ndash;45 air raids and during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Berlin. Among the hundreds of thousands who died during the Battle for Berlin, an estimated 125,000 were civilians. After the <!--del_lnk--> end of the war in Europe in 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the <!--del_lnk--> occupation zones into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the <!--del_lnk--> Western Allies (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed <!--del_lnk--> West Berlin, while the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet sector</a> formed <!--del_lnk--> East Berlin.</p>

       <p>All four <!--del_lnk--> Allies shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> imposed a <!--del_lnk--> blockade on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The <!--del_lnk--> Berlin airlift, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from 24 June 1948 to 11 May 1949. In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in <!--del_lnk--> West Germany and eventually included all of the American, British, and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the <!--del_lnk--> Marxist-Leninist <!--del_lnk--> German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but as a <i><!--del_lnk--> corpus separatum</i> it politically was very closely aligned with Federal Republic of Germany despite Berlin's geographic location within East Germany. West Berlin issued its own postage stamps, which were often the same as West German postage stamps but with the additional word "Berlin" added. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British, and French airlines.</p>

       <p>The founding of the two German states increased <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory and East Germany proclaimed East Berlin (described as "Berlin") as its capital, a move that was not recognized by the western powers. Although only half the size and population of West Berlin, East Berlin included most of the historic centre of the city. The West German government, meanwhile, established itself provisionally in <!--del_lnk--> Bonn.</p>
       <p>As a result of the political and economical tensions brought on by the Cold War, on 13 August 1961, East Germany began building of the <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> between East and West Berlin and similar barriers around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at <!--del_lnk--> Checkpoint Charlie on 27 October 1961. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.</p>

       <p>Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other (but only through strictly controlled checkpoints) for most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. In 1971, a <!--del_lnk--> Four-Power agreement guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes.</p>
       <p>In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November 1989 and was subsequently mostly demolished, with little of its physical structure remaining today; the <!--del_lnk--> East Side Gallery in <!--del_lnk--> Friedrichshain near the <i>Oberbaumbr&uuml;cke</i> over the <!--del_lnk--> Spree preserves a portion of the Wall.</p>
       <p>On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were <a href="../../wp/g/German_reunification.htm" title="German reunification">reunified</a> as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became the official German capital. In June 1991, the German Parliament, the <!--del_lnk--> Bundestag, voted the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><!--del_lnk--> Hauptstadtbeschluss</span></i> to move the seat of the (West) German capital back from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999.</p>

       <p>Berlin is situated in northeastern <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, approximately 60&nbsp;km (37&nbsp;mi) west of the <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Polish</a> border, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography, part of the vast <!--del_lnk--> Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> to western <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>. The Berlin&ndash;Warsaw <i>Urstromtal</i> (ice age <!--del_lnk--> glacial valley), between the low <!--del_lnk--> Barnim Plateau to the north and the Teltow Plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last <!--del_lnk--> Weichselian glaciation. The <!--del_lnk--> Spree follows this valley now. In Spandau, Berlin's westernmost borough, the Spree empties into the river <!--del_lnk--> Havel, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and <!--del_lnk--> Gro&szlig;er Wannsee. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the <!--del_lnk--> Gro&szlig;er M&uuml;ggelsee in eastern Berlin.</p>

       <p>Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs <!--del_lnk--> Reinickendorf and <!--del_lnk--> Pankow lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs <!--del_lnk--> Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, <!--del_lnk--> Steglitz-Zehlendorf, <!--del_lnk--> Tempelhof-Sch&ouml;neberg, and <!--del_lnk--> Neuk&ouml;lln lie on the Teltow Plateau.</p>
       <p>The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the <!--del_lnk--> Teufelsberg and the <!--del_lnk--> M&uuml;ggelberge in the city's outskirts, and in the centre the <!--del_lnk--> Kreuzberg. While the latter measures 66&nbsp;m (217&nbsp;ft) above sea level, the former have both an elevation of about 115&nbsp;m (377&nbsp;ft). The Teufelsberg is in fact an artificial hill composed of a <!--del_lnk--> pile of rubble from the ruins of World War II.</p>

       <p>Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of 22&ndash;25&nbsp;&deg;C (72&ndash;77&nbsp;&deg;F) and lows of 12&ndash;14&nbsp;&deg;C (54&ndash;57&nbsp;&deg;F).

       <p>Annual precipitation is 570 millimeters (22&nbsp;in) with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through March, but snow cover does not usually remain for long. The recent winter of 2009/2010 was an exception as there was a permanent snow cover from late December till early March.<br style="clear:both;" />

       <p>Berlin's history has left the city with a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin&mdash;the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany&mdash;initiated ambitious (re-) construction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture. Berlin was devastated by bombing raids during World War II, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished in the 1950s and 1960s in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads.</p>
       <p>The eastern parts of Berlin have many <i><!--del_lnk--> Plattenbauten</i>, reminders of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Bloc ambitions to create complete residential areas that had fixed ratios of shops, kindergartens and schools to the number of inhabitants.</p>

Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its 204&nbsp;m (669&nbsp;ft) high observation floor. Starting here the <!--del_lnk--> Karl-Marx-Allee heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the <!--del_lnk--> Socialist Classicism Style of the <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> era. Adjacent to this area is the <!--del_lnk--> Rotes Rathaus (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture.

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Brandenburg Gate is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany. It also appears on German euro coins (10&nbsp;cent, 20&nbsp;cent, and 50&nbsp;cent). The <!--del_lnk--> Reichstag building is the traditional seat of the German Parliament, renovated in the 1950s after severe World War II damage. The building was again remodeled by British architect <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Norman_Foster%252C_Baron_Foster_of_Thames_Bank.htm" title="Norman Foster (architect)">Norman Foster</a> in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.</p>

Also located on the island and adjacent to the <!--del_lnk--> Lustgarten and palace is <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Cathedral, emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to <!--del_lnk--> St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. The church is now owned by the Protestant umbrella <!--del_lnk--> Union of Evangelical Churches (UEK). Like many other buildings, it suffered extensive damage during the Second World War and had to be restored. Berlin's best preserved medieval <!--del_lnk--> Church of St. Mary's is the 1<sup>st</sup> preaching venue&nbsp;&ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Memorial Church being the 2<sup>nd</sup> &ndash; of the Bishop of the <!--del_lnk--> Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO), a Protestant <!--del_lnk--> regional church body. <!--del_lnk--> St. Hedwig's Cathedral is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Unter den Linden is a tree-lined east&ndash;west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of <!--del_lnk--> Humboldt University is located there. <!--del_lnk--> Friedrichstra&szlig;e was Berlin's legendary street during the <!--del_lnk--> Roaring Twenties. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Potsdamer Platz is an entire quarter built from scratch after 1995 after the <!--del_lnk--> Wall came down. To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the <!--del_lnk--> Gem&auml;ldegalerie, and is flanked by the <!--del_lnk--> Neue Nationalgalerie and the <!--del_lnk--> Berliner Philharmonie. The <!--del_lnk--> Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> memorial, is situated to the north.</p>
       <p>The area around <!--del_lnk--> Hackescher Markt is home to the fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the <!--del_lnk--> Hackesche H&ouml;fe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. <!--del_lnk--> Oranienburger Stra&szlig;e and the nearby <!--del_lnk--> New Synagogue were the centre of Jewish culture before 1933.

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Stra&szlig;e des 17. Juni, connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as central East-West-Axis. Its name commemorates the <!--del_lnk--> uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953. Approximately half-way from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro&szlig;er Stern, a circular traffic island on which the <!--del_lnk--> Siegess&auml;ule (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated 1938&ndash;39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Kurf&uuml;rstendamm is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the <!--del_lnk--> Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at its eastern end on <!--del_lnk--> Breitscheidplatz. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra&szlig;e is <!--del_lnk--> KaDeWe, claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The <!--del_lnk--> Rathaus Sch&ouml;neberg, where <a href="../../wp/j/John_F._Kennedy.htm" title="John F. Kennedy">John F.

       <p>West of the centre, <!--del_lnk--> Schloss Bellevue is the residence of the German President. <!--del_lnk--> Schloss Charlottenburg, which was burnt out in the Second World War and largely destroyed, has been rebuilt and is the largest surviving historical palace in Berlin.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Funkturm Berlin is a 150&nbsp;m (490&nbsp;ft) tall lattice radio tower at the fair area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators, and has a restaurant 55&nbsp;m (180&nbsp;ft) and an observation deck 126&nbsp;m (413&nbsp;ft) above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.</p>

       <p>The city and state parliament is the <!--del_lnk--> House of Representatives (<i>Abgeordnetenhaus</i>), which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the <!--del_lnk--> Senate of Berlin (<i>Senat von Berlin</i>). The Senate of Berlin consists of the <!--del_lnk--> Governing Mayor (<i>Regierender B&uuml;rgermeister</i>) and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the official title "Mayor" (<i>B&uuml;rgermeister</i>) as deputy to the Governing Mayor. The <!--del_lnk--> Social Democratic Party (SPD) and <!--del_lnk--> The Left (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 state election and won another term in the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 state election. After the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 state election, there is a coalition of the Social Democratic Party with the <!--del_lnk--> Christian Democratic Union, and for the first time ever, the <!--del_lnk--> Pirate Party won seats in a state parliament in Germany.</p>
       <p>The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the city (<i>Oberb&uuml;rgermeister der Stadt</i>) and Prime Minister of the Federal State (<i>Ministerpr&auml;sident des Bundeslandes</i>). The office of Berlin's Governing Mayor is in the <!--del_lnk--> Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall). Since 2001 this office has been held by <!--del_lnk--> Klaus Wowereit of the SPD.</p>
       <p>The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2007 exceeded &euro;20.5 ($28.7) billion including a budget surplus of &euro;80 ($112) million. The figures indicate the first surplus in the history of the city state. Due to increasing growth rates and tax revenues, the Senate of Berlin calculates an increasing budget surplus in 2008. The total budget includes an estimated amount of &euro;5.5 ($7.7) bn, which is directly financed by either the German government or the German Bundesl&auml;nder. Mainly due to reunification-related expenditures, Berlin as a German state has accumulated more debt than any other city in Germany, with the most current estimate being &euro;60 ($84)bn in December 2007. In 2011, the very high level of <!--del_lnk--> public sector debt prompted the Stabilit&auml;tsrat von Bund und L&auml;ndern (Council for Fiscal Stability of the Federal and Local States) to declare a possible fiscal emergency for the city.</p>
       <p>Since German reunification on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three <!--del_lnk--> city states, together with <a href="../../wp/h/Hamburg.htm" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, among the present 16 states of Germany.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Berlin is subdivided into twelve boroughs (<i>Bezirke</i>), down from 23 boroughs before <!--del_lnk--> Berlin's 2001 administrative reform. Each borough contains a number of localities (<i>Ortsteile</i>), which often have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920 and became urbanized and incorporated into the city. Many residents strongly identify with their localities or boroughs. At present Berlin consists of 96 localities, which are commonly made up of several city neighborhoods&mdash;called <i><!--del_lnk--> Kiez</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> Berlin dialect&mdash;representing small residential areas.</p>
       <p>Each borough is governed by a borough council (<i>Bezirksamt</i>) consisting of five councilors (<i>Bezirksstadtr&auml;te</i>) and a borough mayor (<i>Bezirksb&uuml;rgermeister</i>). The borough council is elected by the borough assembly (<i>Bezirksverordnetenversammlung</i>). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities, however. The power of borough governments is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the council of mayors (<i>Rat der B&uuml;rgermeister</i>), led by the city's governing mayor, which advises the senate.</p>

       <p>Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities. Town twinning between Berlin and other cities began with Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification and later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Pact and its allies.</p>
       <p>There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as <a href="../../wp/b/Belgrade.htm" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Helsinki.htm" title="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Johannesburg.htm" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Shanghai.htm" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Seoul.htm" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Sofia, <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, and <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>.

       <p>Berlin's energy is mainly supplied by the Swedish firm <!--del_lnk--> Vattenfall, which relies more heavily than other electricity producers on <!--del_lnk--> lignite as an energy source. Because burning lignite produces harmful emissions, Vattenfall has announced its commitment to transitioning to cleaner sources, such as <a href="../../wp/r/Renewable_energy.htm" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a>. In the former West Berlin, electricity was supplied chiefly by thermal power stations. To facilitate buffering during load peaks, <!--del_lnk--> accumulators were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low energy consumption and unloaded during periods of high consumption.</p>
       <p>In 1993 the power grid connections to the surrounding areas, which had been cut in 1951, were restored. In the western districts of Berlin, nearly all power lines are underground cables; only a 380&nbsp;kV and a 110&nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban <!--del_lnk--> Autobahn, use overhead lines. The <!--del_lnk--> Berlin 380-kV electric line was built when West Berlin's electrical grid was not connected to those of East or West Germany. This has now become the backbone of the city's energy grid.</p>

The urban area of Berlin stretches beyond the city limits and comprises about 3.7&nbsp;million people, while the metropolitan area of the Berlin-Brandenburg region is home to about 4.5&nbsp;million in an area of 5,370&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (2,070&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). In 2004, The <!--del_lnk--> Larger Urban Zone was home to over 4.9&nbsp;million people in an area of 17,385&nbsp;km&sup2;. The entire Berlin-Brandenburg region has a population then of 6 million.</p>
       <p>National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, following the revocation of the <!--del_lnk--> Edict of Nantes in France, the city responded with the <!--del_lnk--> Edict of Potsdam, which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The <!--del_lnk--> Greater Berlin Act in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (25&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) to 883&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (341&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and the population from 1.9&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million.<br /> Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to about 250,000 <!--del_lnk--> Turks (especially in <!--del_lnk--> Kreuzberg, <!--del_lnk--> Neuk&ouml;lln and <!--del_lnk--> Wedding, a locality in the borough of <!--del_lnk--> Mitte), making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.</p>
       <p>In the 1990s the <i>Aussiedlergesetze</i> enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Today ethnic <!--del_lnk--> Germans from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community. The current decade experiences an increasing influx from various Western countries. Especially young EU-Europeans are settling in the city. Additionally, Berlin has seen a rise of African immigrants during the last two decades.</p>
       <p>In December 2010, 457,806 residents (13.5% of the population) were of foreign nationality, originating from 190 different countries. The largest groups of foreign nationals are those from Turkey (104,556), Poland (40,988), Serbia (19,230), Italy (15,842), Russia (15,332), France (13,262), Vietnam (13,199), the United States (12,733), Bosnia and Herzegovina (10,198), the United Kingdom (10,191), Croatia (10,104), and Israel (estimated 10,000). An estimated 394,000 citizens (12.2%) are descendants of international migrants and have either become naturalized German citizens or obtained citizenship by virtue of birth in Germany. All in all, about 25%&ndash;30% of the population is of foreign origin</p>
       <p>The Berlin Senate estimates that Berlin&rsquo;s population will grow modestly to 3.75 million inhabitants in 2030. The greatest increase will be 20 percent for 6- to 18-year-olds. The average age will rise slightly though to over 44 due to longer life expectancies.</p>

       <p>Berlin's nightlife is one of the most diverse and vibrant of its kind in Europe. Throughout the 1990s, people in their twenties from many countries, particularly those in Eastern and Central Europe, made Berlin's club scene the premier nightlife destination of Europe. After the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Fall of the Berlin Wall">fall of the Berlin Wall</a> in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city centre of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and <!--del_lnk--> counterculture gatherings. Mitte and surrounding boroughs are also home to many nightclubs, including <!--del_lnk--> techno clubs <!--del_lnk--> Tresor, WMF, <!--del_lnk--> Ufo, <!--del_lnk--> E-Werk, <!--del_lnk--> KitKatClub and <!--del_lnk--> Berghain. The techno-music club, Linientreu, near the <!--del_lnk--> Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, has been in business since the late 1980s.</p>

       <p>Berlin is notable for its diverse partyscene. Clubs are not required to close at a fixed time on the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning, or all weekend. Berghain features the Panorama Bar, so named because the bar opens its shades at daybreak, allowing party-goers a panorama view of Berlin after dancing through the night.</p>
       <p>The SO36 in Kreuzberg originally focused largely on <!--del_lnk--> punk music, but today has become a popular venue for many dances and parties. SOUND, located from 1971 to 1988 in Tiergarten and today in Charlottenburg, gained notoriety in the late 1970s for its popularity with heroin users and other drug addicts as described in <!--del_lnk--> Christiane F.'s book <i>Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo</i>.</p>
       <p>The Karneval der Kulturen, a multi-ethnic street parade celebrated every <!--del_lnk--> Pentecost weekend, and the <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Street Day are both supported by the city's government. Berlin is also well known for the cultural festival, <!--del_lnk--> Berliner Festspiele, which include the jazz festival <!--del_lnk--> JazzFest Berlin.

       <p>Berlin has a long history of gay culture and influence on popular entertainment, and according to some authors, in the 1920s the city was the <i>Gay Capital of Europe</i>.

The ensemble on the <!--del_lnk--> Museum Island is a UNESCO <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a> and is situated in the northern part of the Spree Island between the Spree and the Kupfergraben. As early as 1841 it was designated a "district dedicated to art and antiquities" by a royal decree. Subsequently, the <!--del_lnk--> Altes Museum (Old Museum) was built in the Lustgarten. The <!--del_lnk--> Neues Museum (New Museum), which displays the <!--del_lnk--> bust of Queen Nefertiti, <!--del_lnk--> Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery), <!--del_lnk--> Pergamon Museum, and <!--del_lnk--> Bode Museum were built there. While these buildings once housed distinct collections, the names of the buildings no longer necessarily correspond to the names of their collections.</p>
       <p>Apart from the Museum Island, there are many additional museums in the city. The <!--del_lnk--> Gem&auml;ldegalerie (Painting Gallery) focuses on the paintings of the "old masters" from the 13th to the 18th centuries, while the <!--del_lnk--> Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery, built by <!--del_lnk--> Ludwig Mies van der Rohe) specializes in 20th-century European painting. The <!--del_lnk--> Hamburger Bahnhof, located in <!--del_lnk--> Moabit, exhibits a major collection of modern and contemporary art. In spring 2006, the expanded <!--del_lnk--> Deutsches Historisches Museum re-opened in the Zeughaus with an overview of German history through the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The <!--del_lnk--> Bauhaus Archive is an architecture museum.</p>
