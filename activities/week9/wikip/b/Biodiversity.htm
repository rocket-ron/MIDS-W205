       <p><b>Biodiversity</b> is the variation of <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a> forms within a given <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem, <a href="../../wp/b/Biome.htm" title="Biome">biome</a> or for the entire <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>. Biodiversity is often used as a measure of the health of <!--del_lnk--> biological systems.</p>
       <p>Biodiversity found on Earth today consists of many millions of distinct biological <a href="../../wp/s/Species.htm" title="Species">species</a>, which is the product of four billion years of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a>.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Evolution_and_meaning">Evolution and meaning</span></h2>
       <p>Biodiversity is a <!--del_lnk--> neologism and <!--del_lnk--> portmanteau word, from <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a> and diversity. The Science Division of <!--del_lnk--> The Nature Conservancy used the term "natural diversity" in a 1975 study, "The Preservation of Natural Diversity." The term <i>biological diversity</i> was used even before that by conservation scientists like <!--del_lnk--> Robert E. Jenkins and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Lovejoy. The word <i>biodiversity</i> itself may have been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985 while planning the <i>National Forum on Biological Diversity</i> organized by the <!--del_lnk--> National Research Council (NRC) which was to be held in 1986, and first appeared in a publication in 1988 when entomologist <!--del_lnk--> E. O. Wilson used it as the title of the <!--del_lnk--> proceedings of that forum. The word <i>biodiversity</i> was deemed more effective in terms of communication than <i>biological diversity.</i></p>
       <p>Since 1986 the terms and the concept have achieved widespread use among biologists, environmentalists, political leaders, and concerned citizens worldwide. It is generally used to equate to a concern for the natural environment and nature conservation. This use has coincided with the expansion of concern over <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinction</a> observed in the last decades of the 20th century.</p>
       <p>The term "natural heritage" pre-dates "biodiversity", though it is a less scientific term and more easily comprehended in some ways by the wider audience interested in conservation. "Natural Heritage" was used when <a href="../../wp/j/Jimmy_Carter.htm" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> set up the Georgia Heritage Trust while he was governor of Georgia; Carter's trust dealt with both natural and <!--del_lnk--> cultural heritage. It would appear that Carter picked the term up from <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Lyndon_B._Johnson.htm" title="Lyndon Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>, who used it in a 1966 Message to Congress. "Natural Heritage" was picked up by the Science Division of <!--del_lnk--> The Nature Conservancy when, under Jenkins, it launched in 1974 the network of State Natural Heritage Programs. When this network was extended outside the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="USA">USA</a>, the term "Conservation Data Centre" was suggested by Guillermo Mann and came to be preferred.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definitions">Definitions</span></h2>
       <p>The most straightforward definition is "variation of life at all levels of biological organization". A second definition holds that biodiversity is a measure of the relative diversity among organisms present in different ecosystems. "Diversity" in this definition includes diversity within a species and among species, and comparative diversity among ecosystems.</p>
       <p>A third definition that is often used by ecologists is the "totality of genes, species, and ecosystems of a region". An advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances and present a unified view of the traditional three levels at which biodiversity has been identified:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> genetic diversity - diversity of <!--del_lnk--> genes within a species. There is a genetic variability among the populations and the individuals of the same species. (See also <!--del_lnk--> population genetics.)</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> species diversity - diversity among <a href="../../wp/s/Species.htm" title="Species">species</a> in an ecosystem. "<!--del_lnk--> Biodiversity hotspots" are excellent examples of species diversity.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> ecosystem diversity - diversity at a higher level of organization, the <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem. Diversity of habitat in a given unit area. To do with the variety of ecosystems on Earth.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The 1992 <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <!--del_lnk--> Earth Summit in <a href="../../wp/r/Rio_de_Janeiro.htm" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> defined "biodiversity" as "the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia', <!--del_lnk--> terrestrial, <!--del_lnk--> marine, and other <!--del_lnk--> aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems". This is, in fact, the closest thing to a single legally accepted definition of biodiversity, since it is the definition adopted by the United Nations <!--del_lnk--> Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
       <p>If the gene is the fundamental unit of <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>, according to E. O. Wilson, the real biodiversity is genetic diversity. For <!--del_lnk--> geneticists, <i>biodiversity</i> is the diversity of genes and <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a>. They study processes such as mutations, gene exchanges, and genome dynamics that occur at the DNA level and generate evolution.</p>
       <p>For <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecologist">ecologists</a>, biodiversity is also the diversity of durable interactions among species. It not only applies to species, but also to their immediate environment (<!--del_lnk--> biotope) and their larger <!--del_lnk--> ecoregion. In each <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem, living organisms are part of a whole, interacting with not only other organisms, but also with the air, water, and <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soil</a> that surround them..</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Measurement">Measurement</span></h2>
       <p>Biodiversity is a broad concept, so a variety of objective measures have been created in order to <!--del_lnk--> empirically measure biodiversity. Each measure of biodiversity relates to a particular use of the data.</p>
       <p>For practical <!--del_lnk--> conservationists, this measure should quantify a value that is broadly shared among locally affected people. For others, a more economically defensible definition should allow the ensuring of continued possibilities for both adaptation and future use by people, assuring environmental <!--del_lnk--> sustainability.</p>
       <p>As a consequence, biologists argue that this measure is likely to be associated with the variety of genes. Since it cannot always be said which genes are more likely to prove beneficial, the best choice for <!--del_lnk--> conservation is to assure the persistence of as many genes as possible. For ecologists, this latter approach is sometimes considered too restrictive, as it prohibits <!--del_lnk--> ecological succession.</p>
       <p>Biodiversity is usually plotted as taxonomic richness of a geographic area, with some reference to a temporal scale. <!--del_lnk--> Whittaker described three common metrics used to measure species-level biodiversity, encompassing attention to <!--del_lnk--> species richness or <!--del_lnk--> species evenness:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Species richness - the least sophisticated of the indices available.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Simpson index</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Shannon index</li>
       </ul>
       <p>There are three other indices which are used by ecologists:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Alpha diversity refers to diversity within a particular area, community or ecosystem, and is measured by counting the number of taxa within the ecosystem (usually species)</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Beta diversity is species diversity between ecosystems; this involves comparing the number of taxa that are <!--del_lnk--> unique to each of the ecosystems.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Gamma diversity is a measure of the overall diversity for different ecosystems within a region.</li>
       </ul>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
       <p>Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is consistently richer in the <a href="../../wp/t/Tropics.htm" title="Tropics">tropics</a> and in other localized regions such as the <!--del_lnk--> California Floristic Province. As one approaches polar regions one generally finds fewer species. Flora and fauna diversity depends on <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a>, altitude, <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soils</a> and the presence of other species. In the year 2006 large numbers of the Earth's species were formally classified as <!--del_lnk--> rare or <!--del_lnk--> endangered or <!--del_lnk--> threatened species; moreover, many scientists have estimated that there are millions more species actually endangered which have not yet been formally recognized. About 40 percent of the 40,177 species assessed using the <!--del_lnk--> IUCN Red List criteria, are now listed as <!--del_lnk--> threatened species with extinction - a total of 16,119 species.</p>
       <p>A <!--del_lnk--> biodiversity hotspot is a region with a high level of <!--del_lnk--> endemic species. These biodiversity hotspots were first identified by Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Norman Myers in two articles in the scientific journal <i>The Environmentalist</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Dense human habitation tends to occur near hotspots. Most hotspots are located in the <a href="../../wp/t/Tropics.htm" title="Tropics">tropics</a> and most of them are forests.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Forest is considered a hotspot of biodiversity and contains roughly 20,000 plant species, 1350 vertebrates, and millions of insects, about half of which occur nowhere else in the world. The island of <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> including the unique <!--del_lnk--> Madagascar dry deciduous forests and lowland rainforests possess a very high ratio of species <!--del_lnk--> endemism and biodiversity, since the island separated from mainland <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> 65 million years ago, most of the species and ecosystems have evolved independently producing unique species different from those in other parts of Africa.</p>
       <p>Many regions of high biodiversity (as well as high <!--del_lnk--> endemism) arise from very specialized <!--del_lnk--> habitats which require unusual adaptation mechanisms. For example the peat <a href="../../wp/b/Bog.htm" title="Bog">bogs</a> of Northern <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the alvar regions such as the <!--del_lnk--> Stora Alvaret on <!--del_lnk--> Oland, <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> host a large diversity of plants and animals, many of which are not found elsewhere.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Biodiversity found on <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> today is the result of 4 billion years of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> origin of life has not been definitely established by science, however some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established a few hundred million years after the <!--del_lnk--> formation of the Earth. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life consisted of <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> and similar single-celled organisms.</p>
       <p>The history of biodiversity during the <!--del_lnk--> Phanerozoic (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cambrian_explosion.htm" title="Cambrian explosion">Cambrian explosion</a>&mdash;a period during which nearly every <!--del_lnk--> phylum of <!--del_lnk--> multicellular organisms first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, global diversity showed little overall trend, but was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as <!--del_lnk--> mass extinction events.</p>
       <p>The apparent biodiversity shown in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil record">fossil record</a> suggests that the last few million years include the period of greatest biodiversity in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/History_of_the_Earth.htm" title="History of Earth">Earth's history</a>. However, not all scientists support this view, since there is considerable uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geologic</a> sections. Some (e.g. Alroy et al. 2001) argue that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity is not much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago. Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million species, with a best estimate of somewhere near 13-14 million, the vast majority of them <a href="../../wp/a/Arthropod.htm" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a>.</p>
       <p>Most biologists agree however that the period since the emergence of humans is part of a new mass extinction, the <!--del_lnk--> Holocene extinction event, caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment. It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within 100 years.</p>
       <p>New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5-10,000 new species each year, most of them <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a>) and many, though discovered, are not yet classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all <a href="../../wp/a/Arthropod.htm" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a> are not yet classified). Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in <!--del_lnk--> tropical forests.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Benefits">Benefits</span></h2>
       <p>There are a multitude of <!--del_lnk--> anthropocentric benefits of biodiversity in the areas of agriculture, science and medicine, industrial materials, ecological services, in leisure, and in cultural, aesthetic and intellectual value. Biodiversity is also central to an <!--del_lnk--> ecocentric philosophy. It is important for contemporary audiences to understand the reasons for believing in conservation of biodiversity. One way to identify the reasons why we believe in it is to look at what we get from biological diversity and the things that we lose as a result of species extinction, which has taken place over the last 600 years. Mass extinction is the direct result of human activity and not of natural phenomena which is the perception of many modern day thinkers. There are many benefits that are obtained from natural ecosystem processes. Some ecosystem services that benefit society are air quality, climate (both global Co2 sequestration and regional and local), water purification, disease control, biological pest control, pollination and prevention of erosion. Along with those come non- material benefits that are obtained from ecosystems which are spiritual and aesthetic values, knowledge systems and the value of education that we obtain today. However, the public remains unaware of the crisis in sustaining biodiversity. Biodiversity takes a look into the importance to life and provides modern audiences with a clear understanding of the current threat to life on Earth.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Agriculture">Agriculture</span></h3>
       <p>For some foodcrops and other economic crops, wild varieties of the domesticated species can be reintroduced to form a better variety than the previous (domesticated) species. The economic impact is gigantic, for even crops as common as the potato (which was bred through only one variety, brought back from the Inca), a lot more can come from these species. Wild varieties of the potato will all suffer enormously through the effects of climate change. A report by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) describes the huge economic loss. Rice, which has been improved for thousands of years by humans, can through the same process regain some of its nutritional value that has been lost since (a project is already being carried out to do just this).</p>
       <p>Crop diversity is also necessary to help the system recover when the dominant crop type is attacked by a disease:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The Irish potato blight of 1846, which was a major factor in the deaths of a million people and migration of another million, was the result of planting only two potato varieties, both of which were vulnerable.</li>
        <li>When the <!--del_lnk--> rice grassy stunt virus struck rice fields from Indonesia to India in the 1970s, 6273 varieties were tested. Only one was luckily found to be resistant, a relatively feeble Indian variety, known to science only since 1966, with the desired trait. It was hybridised with other varieties and now widely grown.</li>
        <li>In 1970, coffee rust attacked coffee plantations in Sri Lanka, Brazil, and Central America. A resistant variety was found in Ethiopia, coffee's presumed homeland, which mitigated the rust epidemic.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Monoculture, the lack of biodiversity, was a contributing factor to several agricultural disasters in history, including the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Potato Famine, the European wine industry collapse in the late 1800s, and the <!--del_lnk--> US Southern Corn Leaf Blight epidemic of 1970. See also: <!--del_lnk--> Agricultural biodiversity</p>
       <p>Higher biodiversity also controls the spread of certain diseases as pathogens will need to adapt to infect different species.</p>
       <p>Biodiversity provides food for humans. Although about 80 percent of our food supply comes from just 20 kinds of plants, humans use at least 40,000 species of plants and animals a day. Many people around the world depend on these species for their food, shelter, and clothing. There is untapped potential for increasing the range of food products suitable for human consumption, provided that the high present extinction rate can be stopped.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Science_and_medicine">Science and medicine</span></h3>
       <p>A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources; in most cases these medicines can not presently be synthesized in a laboratory setting. About 40% of the pharmaceuticals used in the US are manufactured using natural compounds found in plants, animals, and microorganisms. Moreover, only a small proportion of the total diversity of plants has been thoroughly investigated for potential sources of new drugs. Many drugs are also derived from <!--del_lnk--> microorganisms.</p>
       <p>Through the field of <!--del_lnk--> bionics, considerable technological advancement has occurred which would not have without a rich biodiversity. ..</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Industrial_materials">Industrial materials</span></h3>
       <p>A wide range of industrial materials are derived directly from biological resources. These include building materials, fibers, dyes, resins, gums, adhesives, rubber and oil. There is enormous potential for further research into sustainably utilizing materials from a wider diversity of organisms.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_ecological_services">Other ecological services</span></h3>
       <p>Biodiversity provides many <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem services that are often not readily visible. It plays a part in regulating the chemistry of our <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere and <!--del_lnk--> water supply. Biodiversity is directly involved in recycling <a href="../../wp/n/Nutrient.htm" title="Nutrient">nutrients</a> and providing fertile soils. Experiments with controlled environments have shown that humans cannot easily build ecosystems to support human needs; for example <!--del_lnk--> insect pollination cannot be mimicked by human-made construction, and that activity alone represents tens of billions of dollars in <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem services per annum to humankind.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Leisure.2C_cultural_and_aesthetic_value">Leisure, cultural and aesthetic value</span></h3>
       <p>Many people derive value from biodiversity through leisure activities such as <!--del_lnk--> hiking in the countryside, <!--del_lnk--> birdwatching or natural history study.</p>
       <p>Biodiversity has inspired <!--del_lnk--> musicians, painters, sculptors, writers and other artists. Many cultural groups view themselves as an integral part of the natural world and show respect for other living organisms.</p>
       <p>Popular activities such as gardening, caring for aquariums and collecting butterflies are all strongly dependent on biodiversity. The number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands, though the great majority do not enter mainstream commercialism.</p>
       <p>The relationships between the original natural areas of these often 'exotic' animals and plants and commercial collectors, suppliers, breeders, propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood. It seems clear, however, that the general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organisms">organisms</a>-- they recognize their inherent value at some level, even if they would not want the responsibility of caring for them. A family outing to the <!--del_lnk--> botanical garden or zoo is as much an aesthetic or cultural experience as it is an educational one.</p>
       <p>Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and/or spiritual value to mankind <i>in and of itself</i>. This idea can be used as a counterweight to the rather notion that <!--del_lnk--> tropical forests and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because they may contain medicines or useful products.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hindrances">Hindrances</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Funds">Funds</span></h3>
       <p>Humans have generally expanded and developed their territory throughout history. An active approach is the only way to halt the expansion but this often requires funds or wise stewardship. Currently the United States Environmental Protection Agency has an annual budget of $7.3 billion (2007).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Preservation_of_invertebrate_and_plant_species">Preservation of invertebrate and plant species</span></h3>
       <p>Biodiversity is most well known to the public as a loss of animals with a backbone, when in fact there exist 20 times that number of insects and five times as many flowering plants. While many of these species may be highly valuable to the human race for the above reasons, the vast majority are often completely unknown to anyone but specialists. In fact it is often estimated that less than half and perhaps less than two-thirds of earth organisms have even been identified.</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Threats">Threats</span></h2>
       <p>During the last century, erosion of biodiversity has been increasingly observed. Some studies show that about one eighth known plant species is threatened with <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinction</a>. Some estimates put the loss at up to 140,000 species per year (based on <!--del_lnk--> Species-area theory) and subject to discussion. This figure indicates <!--del_lnk--> unsustainable ecological practices, because only a small number of species come into being each year. Almost all scientists acknowledge that the rate of species loss is greater now than at any time in human history, with extinctions occurring at rates hundreds of times higher than <!--del_lnk--> background extinction rates.</p>
       <p>The factors that threaten biodiversity have been variously categorized. Jared Diamond describes an "Evil Quartet" of habitat destruction, overkill, introduced species, and secondary extensions. <!--del_lnk--> Edward O. Wilson prefers the <!--del_lnk--> acronym <b>HIPPO</b>, standing for <b>H</b>abitat destruction, <b>I</b>nvasive species, <b>P</b>ollution, <b>P</b>opulation, and <b>O</b>verharvesting.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Destruction_of_habitats">Destruction of habitats</span></h3>
       <p>Most of the species extinctions from 1000 AD to 2000 AD are due to human activities, in particular destruction of plant and animal <!--del_lnk--> habitats. Raised rates of extinction are being driven by human <!--del_lnk--> consumption of organic resources, especially related to <!--del_lnk--> tropical forest destruction. While most of the species that are becoming extinct are not food species, their <!--del_lnk--> biomass is converted into human food when their habitat is transformed into <!--del_lnk--> pasture, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Farm.htm" title="Cropland">cropland</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> orchards. It is estimated that more than 40% of the Earth's biomass is tied up in only the few species that represent <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Humans">humans</a>, <!--del_lnk--> livestock and <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">crops</a>. Because an <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem decreases in stability as its species are made extinct, these studies warn that the global ecosystem is destined for collapse if it is further reduced in complexity. Factors contributing to loss of biodiversity are: <!--del_lnk--> overpopulation, <!--del_lnk--> deforestation, <a href="../../wp/p/Pollution.htm" title="Pollution">pollution</a> (<!--del_lnk--> air pollution, <!--del_lnk--> water pollution, <!--del_lnk--> soil contamination) and <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a> or climate change, driven by human activity. These factors, while all stemming from overpopulation, produce a cumulative impact upon biodiversity.</p>
       <p>There are systematic relationships between the area of a habitat and the number of species it can support, with greater sensitivity to reduction in habitat area for species of larger body size and for those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans.  Some characterize loss of biodiversity not as ecosystem degradation but by conversion to trivial standardized ecosystems (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> monoculture following <!--del_lnk--> deforestation). In some countries lack of property rights or access regulation to biotic resources necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).</p>
       <p>A <!--del_lnk--> September 14, <a href="../../wp/2/2007.htm" title="2007">2007</a> study conducted by the <!--del_lnk--> National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and <!--del_lnk--> genetic diversity are dependent upon each other--that diversity within a species is necessary to maintain diversity among species, and vice versa. According to the lead researcher in the study, Dr. Richard Lankau, "If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down, and the community becomes dominated by a single species."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Exotic_species">Exotic species</span></h3>
       <p>The rich diversity of unique species across many parts of the world exist only because they are separated by barriers, particularly large rivers, seas, oceans, mountains and deserts from other species of other land masses, particularly the highly fecund, ultra-competitive, generalist "super-species". These are barriers that could never be crossed by natural processes, except for many millions of years in the future through <!--del_lnk--> continental drift. However humans have invented ships and airplanes, and now have the power to bring into contact species that never have met in their evolutionary history, and on a time scale of days, unlike the centuries that historically have accompanied major animal migrations.</p>
       <p>The widespread introduction of <!--del_lnk--> exotic species by humans is a potent threat to biodiversity. When exotic species are introduced to ecosystems and establish self-sustaining populations, the endemic species in that ecosystem, that have not evolved to cope with the exotic species, may not survive. The exotic organisms may be either <!--del_lnk--> predators, <!--del_lnk--> parasites, or simply aggressive species that deprive indigenous species of nutrients, water and light. These exotic or <a href="../../wp/i/Invasive_species.htm" title="Invasive species">invasive species</a> often have features, due to their evolutionary background and new environment, that make them highly competitive; able to become well-established and spread quickly, reducing the effective habitat of <!--del_lnk--> endemic species.</p>
       <p>As a consequence of the above, if humans continue to combine species from different ecoregions, there is the potential that the world's ecosystems will end up dominated by relatively a few, aggressive, <!--del_lnk--> cosmopolitan "super-species".</p>
       <dl>
        <dt>Other 'Decline in amphibian populations'</dt>
       </dl>
       <p>Declines in amphibian populations have been observed since 1980s. Because of the sensitivity of these organisms, they are regarded by many scientists as a marker for the overall health of an ecosystem. Their decline has led to concern about the general current state of biodiversity.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Genetic_pollution">Genetic pollution</span></h3>
       <p>Purebred naturally evolved region specific wild <a href="../../wp/s/Species.htm" title="Species">species</a> can be threatened with <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinction</a> in a big way through the process of <!--del_lnk--> genetic pollution i.e. uncontrolled <!--del_lnk--> hybridization, <!--del_lnk--> introgression and Genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or replacement of local <!--del_lnk--> genotypes as a result of either a numerical and/or <!--del_lnk--> fitness advantage of introduced plant or animal. Nonnative species can bring about a form of extinction of native plants and animals by hybridization and introgression either through purposeful introduction by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. These phenomena can be especially detrimental for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones where the abundant ones can interbreed with them swamping the entire rarer gene pool creating hybrids thus driving the entire original purebred native stock to complete extinction. Attention has to be focused on the extent of this under appreciated problem that is not always apparent from <!--del_lnk--> morphological (outward appearance) observations alone. Some degree of <!--del_lnk--> gene flow may be a normal, evolutionarily constructive process, and all constellations of <!--del_lnk--> genes and <!--del_lnk--> genotypes cannot be preserved however, hybridization with or without introgression may, nevertheless, threaten a rare species' existence.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hybridization_and_genetics">Hybridization and genetics</span></h3>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> and <!--del_lnk--> animal husbandry, <!--del_lnk--> green revolution popularized the use of conventional <!--del_lnk--> hybridization to increase yield many folds by creating "<!--del_lnk--> high-yielding varieties". Often the handful of breeds of plants and animals hybridized originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties, in the rest of the developing world, to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry since have been pushing hybridization with such zeal that several of the wild and indigenous breeds evolved locally over thousands of years having high resistance to local extremes in climate and immunity to diseases etc. have already become extinct or are in grave danger of becoming so in the near future. Due to complete disuse because of un-profitability and uncontrolled intentional and unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding (<!--del_lnk--> genetic pollution) formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread <!--del_lnk--> genetic erosion and genetic pollution resulting in great loss in <!--del_lnk--> genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole.</p>
       <p>A <!--del_lnk--> genetically modified organism (GMO) is an <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organism</a> whose <!--del_lnk--> genetic material has been <!--del_lnk--> altered using the <!--del_lnk--> genetic engineering techniques generally known as <!--del_lnk--> recombinant DNA technology. Genetically Modified (GM) crops today have become a common source for genetic pollution, not only of wild varieties but also of other domesticated varieties derived from relatively natural hybridization.</p>
       <p>It is being said that genetic erosion coupled with genetic pollution is destroying that needed unique <!--del_lnk--> genetic base thereby creating an unforeseen hidden crisis which will result in a severe threat to our <!--del_lnk--> food security for the future when diverse genetic material will cease to exist to be able to further improve or hybridize weakening food crops and livestock against more resistant diseases and climatic changes.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Management">Management</span></h2>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> conservation of biological diversity has become a global concern. Although not everybody agrees on extent and significance of current extinction, most consider biodiversity essential. There are basically two main types of conservation options, <!--del_lnk--> in-situ conservation and <!--del_lnk--> ex-situ conservation. In-situ is usually seen as the ideal conservation strategy. However, its implementation is sometimes infeasible. For example, destruction of rare or endangered species' habitats sometimes requires <!--del_lnk--> ex-situ conservation efforts. Furthermore, ex-situ conservation can provide a backup solution to in-situ conservation projects. Some believe both types of conservation are required to ensure proper preservation. An example of an in-situ conservation effort is the setting-up of protection areas. Examples of ex-situ conservation efforts, by contrast, would be planting germplasts in <!--del_lnk--> seedbanks, or growing the <!--del_lnk--> Wollemi Pine in nurseries. Such efforts allow the preservation of large populations of plants with minimal genetic erosion.</p>
       <p>At national levels a <!--del_lnk--> Biodiversity Action Plan is sometimes prepared to state the protocols necessary to protect an individual species. Usually this plan also details extant data on the species and its habitat. In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">USA</a> such a plan is called a <!--del_lnk--> Recovery Plan.</p>
       <p>The threat to biological diversity was among the hot topics discussed at the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development, in hope of seeing the foundation of a Global Conservation Trust to help maintain plant collections.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Judicial_status">Judicial status</span></h2>
       <p>Biodiversity is beginning to be evaluated and its evolution analysed (through observations, inventories, conservation...) as well as being taken into account in political and judicial decisions: .</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has consequences for biodiversity. It is related to property rights, both private and public. It can define protection for threatened ecosystems, but also some rights and duties (for example, <!--del_lnk--> fishing rights, hunting rights).</li>
        <li>Law regarding species is a more recent issue. It defines species that must be protected because they may be threatened by extinction. The U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Endangered Species Act is an example of an attempt to address the "law and species" issue.</li>
        <li>Laws regarding gene pools are only about a century old. While the genetic approach is not new (domestication, plant traditional selection methods), progress made in the genetic field in the past 20 years have led to a tightening of laws in this field. With the new technologies of genetic analysis and <!--del_lnk--> genetic engineering, people are going through gene <!--del_lnk--> patenting, processes patenting, and a totally new concept of genetic resources. A very hot debate today seeks to define whether the resource is the gene, the organism itself, or its DNA.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The 1972 <a href="../../wp/u/UNESCO.htm" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> convention established that biological resources, such as plants, were the <b>common heritage of mankind</b>. These rules probably inspired the creation of great public banks of genetic resources, located outside the source-countries.</p>
       <p>New global agreements (e.g.<!--del_lnk--> Convention on Biological Diversity), now give <b>sovereign national rights over biological resources</b> (not property). The idea of static conservation of biodiversity is disappearing and being replaced by the idea of dynamic conservation, through the notion of resource and innovation.</p>
       <p>The new agreements commit countries to <b>conserve biodiversity</b>, <b>develop resources for sustainability</b> and <b>share the benefits</b> resulting from their use. Under new rules, it is expected that <!--del_lnk--> bioprospecting or collection of natural products has to be allowed by the biodiversity-rich country, in exchange for a share of the benefits.</p>
       <p>Sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as <!--del_lnk--> Access and Benefit Sharing Agreements (ABAs). The <!--del_lnk--> Convention on Biodiversity spirit implies a prior <!--del_lnk--> informed consent between the source country and the collector, to establish which resource will be used and for what, and to settle on a <!--del_lnk--> fair agreement on benefit sharing. Bioprospecting can become a type of <!--del_lnk--> biopiracy when those principles are not respected.</p>
       <p>Uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved, however. At least one legal commentator has argued that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard, arguing that the multiple layers of scientific uncertainty inherent in the concept of biodiversity will cause administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals. See <!--del_lnk--> Fred Bosselman, A Dozen Biodiversity Puzzles, 12 N.Y.U. Environmental Law Journal 364 (2004)</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Food">Food</span></h3>
       <p>Many have challenged the notion that there is 'vast untapped potential' for reducing humankind's dependence on a relatively small number of domesticated plant and animal species. <!--del_lnk--> Jared Diamond argued, based on studies of the domestication of plants and animals, that the rarity of species suitable for domestication and their occurrence in just a few parts of the world, determined the limited number of locations in which major civilizations could arise. In recent times there have been many studies of minor food sources, but none of these sources have subsequently become major food crops.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Founder_effect">Founder effect</span></h3>
       <p>The field of biodiversity research (inevitably) suffers from natural human <!--del_lnk--> egocentric "<!--del_lnk--> myopic" <!--del_lnk--> cognitive biases. It has often been criticized for being overly defined by the personal interests of the founders (i.e. terrestrial mammals) giving a narrow focus, rather than extending to other areas where it could be useful. This is termed the <i>founder effect</i> by Norse and Irish, (1996). (This was a play on words: the <!--del_lnk--> founder effect in ecology typically refers to the genetic outcome when a small population establishes an isolated breeding group). France and Rigg reviewed the biodiversity literature in 1998 and found that there was a significant lack of papers studying marine <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems, leading them to dub marine biodiversity research the <i>sleeping hydra</i>. More work has been carried out for accessible, diverse coastal systems such as <!--del_lnk--> coral reefs than for inaccessible, species-poor deep sea areas.</p>
       <p>It has been easier to mobilise public opinion and national legislation for the terrestrial realm, which has higher visibility and falls within countries' territorial boundaries. <!--del_lnk--> Marine conservation involves having to pioneer new and international mechanisms of protection as well as solving methodological problems in <!--del_lnk--> marine biology relating to marine ecosystem classification and data-gathering on some of the earth's most difficult species to access and monitor.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Size_bias">Size bias</span></h3>
       <p>Biodiversity researcher <!--del_lnk--> Sean Nee points out that the vast majority of Earth's biodiversity is microbial, and that contemporary biodiversity physics is "firmly fixated on the visible world" (Nee uses "visible" as a synonym for macroscopic). For example, microbial life is very much more metabolically and environmentally diverse than multicellular life (see <!--del_lnk--> extremophile). Nee has stated: "On the tree of life, based on analyses of small-subunit <!--del_lnk--> ribosomal RNA, visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs.</p>
       <p>The size bias is not restricted to consideration of microbes. Entomologist <!--del_lnk--> Nigel Stork states that "to a first approximation, all multicellular species on Earth are insects".</p>
       <p>A reply to this, however, is that biodiversity conservation has never focused exclusively on visible (in this sense) species. From the very beginning, the classification and conservation of natural communities or ecosystem types has been a central part of the effort. The thought behind this has been that since invisible (in this sense) diversity is, due to lack of taxonomy, impossible to treat in the same manner as visible diversity, the best that can be done is to preserve a diversity of ecosystem types, thereby preserving as well as possible the diversity of invisible organisms.</p>
