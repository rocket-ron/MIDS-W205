       <p>The <b>Brahmaputra</b> (Pron: &#x2CC;br&#x251;:m&#x259;&#x2C8;pu:tr&#x259;) (<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit language">Sanskrit</a>: <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#x92C;&#x94D;&#x930;&#x939;&#x94D;&#x92E;&#x92A;&#x941;&#x924;&#x94D;&#x930;</span>; <!--del_lnk--> Assamese: <span lang="as" xml:lang="as">&#x9AC;&#x9CD;&#x9F0;&#x9B9;&#x9CD;&#x9AE;&#x9AA;&#x9C1;&#x9A4;&#x9CD;&#x9F0; &#x9A8;&#x9A6;</span>; <i>Br&ocirc;hm&ocirc;putr&ocirc;</i>), also called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra, is a <!--del_lnk--> trans-boundary river and one of the major <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">rivers</a> of <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>.</p>
       <p>With its origin in the Angsi Glacier, located on the northern side of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalaya">Himalayas</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Burang County of <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> Tibet Autonomous Region as the <!--del_lnk--> Yarlung Tsangpo River, it flows across southern Tibet to break through the <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> in great gorges (including the <!--del_lnk--> Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon) and into <!--del_lnk--> Arunachal Pradesh (India) where it is known as Dihang or <!--del_lnk--> Siang. It flows southwest through the <!--del_lnk--> Assam Valley as Brahmaputra and south through <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> as the <!--del_lnk--> Jamuna (not to be mistaken with <!--del_lnk--> Yamuna of India). In the vast <!--del_lnk--> Ganges Delta it merges with the <!--del_lnk--> Padma, the main <!--del_lnk--> distributary of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Ganges.htm" title="Ganges River">Ganges</a>, then the <!--del_lnk--> Meghna, before emptying into the <a href="../../wp/b/Bay_of_Bengal.htm" title="Bay of Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>.</p>
       <p>About 1,800 miles (2,900&nbsp;km) long, the Brahmaputra is an important river for <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> and transportation. The average depth of the river is 124 feet (38&nbsp;m) and maximum depth is 380 feet (120&nbsp;m). The river is prone to catastrophic flooding in spring when the Himalayan snows melt. The average discharge of the river is about 19,300 cubic metres per second (680,000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft/s), and floods can reach over 100,000 cubic metres per second (3,500,000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft/s). It is a classic example of a <!--del_lnk--> braided river and is highly susceptible to <!--del_lnk--> channel migration and <!--del_lnk--> avulsion. It is also one of the few rivers in the world that exhibit a <!--del_lnk--> tidal bore. It is navigable for most of its length.</p>
       <p>The river drains the Himalaya east of the Indo-Nepal border, southern-central portion of the Tibetan plateau above the <a href="../../wp/g/Ganges.htm" title="Ganges">Ganges</a> basin, south-eastern portion of Tibet, the Patkai-Bum hills, the northern slopes of the Meghalaya hills, the Assam plains and the northern portion of Bangladesh. The basin, especially south of Tibet is characterized by high levels of rainfall. <!--del_lnk--> Kangchenjunga (8,586m) is the only peak above 8,000m and the highest point within the Brahmaputra basin.</p>
       <p>The Brahmaputra's upper course was long unknown, and its identity with the Yarlung Tsangpo was only established by exploration in 1884&ndash;86. This river is often called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river.</p>
       <p>The lower reaches are sacred to <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hindus</a>. While most rivers on the Indian subcontinent have female names, this river has a rare male name, as it means "son of <!--del_lnk--> Brahma" in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> (putra means "son").</p>

       <p>The Brahmaputra river (also called as "<i>Burlung-Buthur</i>" by the <!--del_lnk--> Bodo people of Assam), called Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibetan language, originates on the <b><!--del_lnk--> Angsi Glacier</b> located on the northern side of the Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet and not Chema-Yungdung glacier, which was previously identified by geographer Swami Pranavananda in the 1930s.The river is 3,848&nbsp;km long, and its drainage area is 712,035 square km according to the new findings, while previous documents showed its length varied from 2,900 to 3,350&nbsp;km and its drainage area between 520,000 and 1.73 million square km. This finding has been given by Mr. Liu Shaochuang, a researcher with the Institute of Remote Sensing Applications under the analysis using expeditions and satellite imagery from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). </p>

       <p>The Brahmaputra enters India in the state of <!--del_lnk--> Arunachal Pradesh, where it is called <i>Siang</i>. It makes a very rapid descent from its original height in Tibet, and finally appears in the plains, where it is called <i>Dihang</i>. It flows for about 35 kilometres (22&nbsp;mi) and is joined by the <!--del_lnk--> Dibang River and the <!--del_lnk--> Lohit River at the head of the Assam Valley. Below the Lohit the river is called <i>Brahmaputra</i>, enters the state of <!--del_lnk--> Assam and becomes very wide&mdash;as wide as 10 kilometres (6.2&nbsp;mi) in parts of Assam. It is joined in <!--del_lnk--> Sonitpur by the <!--del_lnk--> Kameng River (or <i>Jia Bhoreli</i>).</p>
       <p>Between <!--del_lnk--> Dibrugarh and <!--del_lnk--> Lakhimpur districts the river divides into two channels&mdash;the northern <i>Kherkutia</i> channel and the southern Brahmaputra channel. The two channels join again about 100 kilometres (62&nbsp;mi) downstream forming the <!--del_lnk--> Majuli island, which was, until some time back,the largest river island in the world. At <!--del_lnk--> Guwahati, near the ancient pilgrimage centre of <!--del_lnk--> Hajo, the Brahmaputra cuts through the rocks of the <!--del_lnk--> Shillong Plateau, and is at its narrowest at 1 kilometre (1,100&nbsp;yd) bank-to-bank. Due to the river's narrow width, the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Saraighat was fought here in March 1671. The first rail-cum-road bridge across the Brahmaputra was opened to traffic in April 1962 at <!--del_lnk--> Saraighat.</p>
       <p>The environment of the Brahmaputra <!--del_lnk--> floodplains in Assam have been described as the <!--del_lnk--> Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests <!--del_lnk--> ecoregion.</p>

       </div>
       <p>In Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra is joined by the <!--del_lnk--> Teesta River (or <i>Tista</i>), one of its largest tributaries. Below the Teesta, the Brahmaputra splits into two <!--del_lnk--> distributary branches. The western branch, which contains the majority of the river's flow, continues due south as the Jamuna (<i><span lang="bn-Latn" xml:lang="bn-Latn">Jomuna</span></i>) to merge with the lower Ganges, called the <!--del_lnk--> Padma River (<i><span lang="bn-Latn" xml:lang="bn-Latn">P&ocirc;dda</span></i>). The eastern branch, formerly the larger but now much smaller, is called the lower or old Brahmaputra (<i><span lang="bn-Latn" xml:lang="bn-Latn">Bromhoputro</span></i>). It curves southeast to join the <!--del_lnk--> Meghna River near <a href="../../wp/d/Dhaka.htm" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a>. The Padma and Meghna converge near <!--del_lnk--> Chandpur and flow out into the Bay of Bengal. This final part of the river is called <i>Meghna</i>.</p>
       <p>In the past the course of the lower Brahmaputra was different and passed through the <!--del_lnk--> Jamalpur and <!--del_lnk--> Mymensingh districts. In a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on April 2, 1762, the main channel of the Brahmaputra at Bhahadurabad point was switched southwards and opened as Jamuna due to the result of tectonic uplift of the <!--del_lnk--> Madhupur tract.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ganges Delta, fed by the waters of numerous rivers, including the Ganges and Brahmaputra, is 59,570 square kilometres (23,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) the largest <!--del_lnk--> river deltas in the world.</p>

       <p>During the monsoon season (June&ndash;October), floods are a common occurrence. Deforestation in the Brahmaputra watershed has resulted in increased siltation levels, flash floods, and soil erosion in critical downstream habitat, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Kaziranga National Park in middle Assam. Occasionally, massive flooding causes huge losses to crops, life and property. Periodic flooding is a natural phenomenon which is ecologically important because it helps maintain the lowland grasslands and associated wildlife. Periodic floods also deposit fresh alluvium replenishing the fertile soil of the Brahmaputra River Valley. Thus flooding, agriculture, and agricultural practices are closely connected. Flood control measures are taken by water resource department and the Brahmaputra Board but until now the flood problem is being remained unsolved. At least a third of the land of Majuli island has been eroded by the mighty river. Recently it is suggested that a highway protected by concrete mat along the river and excavation of the river bed can curb this menace. This project, named The Brahmaputra River Restoration Project, is yet to be approved by the Government.</p>

       <p>The waters of the River Brahmaputra are shared by China, India, and Bangladesh. In the 1990s and 2000s, there was repeated speculation about China building a dam at the Great Bend, with a view to divert the waters to the north of the country. This was denied by the Chinese government for many years. At the Kathmandu Workshop of <!--del_lnk--> Strategic Foresight Group in August 2009 on Water Security in the Himalayan Region, which on a rare occasion brought together leading hydrologists from the Basin countries, the Chinese scientists argued that it was not feasible for China to undertake such a diversion. However on 22 April 2010, China confirmed that it was indeed building the <!--del_lnk--> Zangmu Dam on the Brahmaputra, but assured India that the project would not have any significant effect on the downstream flow to India.</p>
       <p>In a meeting of scientists at Dhaka at 2010, 25 leading experts from the Basin countries issued a Dhaka Declaration on Water Security calling for exchange of information in low flow period, and other means of collaboration. Even though the UN Convention on Trans-boundary Water of 1997 does not prevent any of the Basin countries from building a dam, Customary Law offers relief to the lower riparian countries. Also, there is potential for China, India and Bangladesh to develop hydroelectricity projects and transboundary water navigation.</p>

       <p>Early accounts give its name as Dyardanes. A question in connection with the river system of <!--del_lnk--> Mymensingh is when and why the Brahmaputra changed its main channel. It is not improbable that in prehistoric times it flowed directly south more or less along its present main channel. From ancient times up to the end of the eighteenth century it flowed past Jamalpur to Mymensingh and <!--del_lnk--> Egarasindur. The river practically stretched from <!--del_lnk--> Jamalpur to Sherour, 7 or 8 miles as the crow flies, and the present river Shiri was a part of it. As to its course through Dhaka from Egarasindur, there is some uncertainty.</p>
       <p>It may be that the old geographers made mistakes and the fact was that it did not join the Meghna at <!--del_lnk--> Bhairab Blzar but struck off a mile below Egarasindur at Aralia to <!--del_lnk--> Lakhipur and then flowed in a south-westerly direction past <!--del_lnk--> Nangalband and <!--del_lnk--> Panchamighat to <!--del_lnk--> Rampal, joining the Meghna at Rajbari. The dried up bed between Aralia and Lakhiour is wrongly shown as the Lakshya in the revenue maps. This river branches off from the Brahmaputra at Lakhipur.</p>
       <p>In the past the course of the lower Brahmaputra was different and passed through the <!--del_lnk--> Jamalpur and <!--del_lnk--> Mymensingh districts. In a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on April 2, 1762, the main channel of the Brahmaputra at Bhahadurabad point was switched southwards and opened as Jamuna due to the result of tectonic uplift of the <!--del_lnk--> Madhupur tract.</p>
       <p>It has usually been assumed that the change in the course of the main waters of the Brahmaputra took place suddenly in 1787, the year of the heavy flooding of the river Tista. It is, however, well known that the Tista has always been a wandering river, sometimes joining the Ganges, sometimes being shifted westwards by the superior strength of that river and forced to join the Brahmaputra.</p>
       <p>In the middle of the eighteenth century there were at least three fair-sized streams flowing between the <!--del_lnk--> Rajshahi and <a href="../../wp/d/Dhaka.htm" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> Divisions, viz., the Daokoba, a branch of the Tista, the Monash or <!--del_lnk--> Konai, and the <!--del_lnk--> Salangi. The Lahajang and the Elengjany were also important rivers. In Renault's time, the Brahmaputra as a first step towards securing a more direct course to the sea by leaving the <!--del_lnk--> Mahdupur Jungle to the east began to send a considerable volume of water down the Jinai or Jabuna from Jamalpur into the <!--del_lnk--> Monash and <!--del_lnk--> Salangi. These rivers gradually coalesced and kept shifting to the west till they met the Daokoba, which was showing an equally rapid tendency to cut towards the east. The junction of these rivers gave the Brahmaputra a course worthy of her immense power, and the rivers to right and left silted up. In Renault's Altas they very much resemble the rivers of Jessore, which dried up after the hundred mouthed Ganges had cut her new channel to join the Meghna at the south of the <!--del_lnk--> Munshiganj subdivision.</p>

       <p>In 1809, <!--del_lnk--> Buchanan Hamilton wrote that the new channel between Bhawanipur and <!--del_lnk--> Dewanranj "was scarcely inferior to the mighty river, and threatens to sweep away the intermediate country". By 1830, the old channel had been reduced to its present insignificance. It was navigable by country boats throughout the year and by launches only during rains, but at the point as low as Jamalpur it was formidable throughout the cold weather. Similar was the position for two or three months just below Mymenensingh also.</p>
       <p>As early as in 1830 there were resumption proceedings for chars which had formed in the new bed. Enquiries showed that many of the new formations were on the site of permanently settled villages which had been washed away by the changes in the course of the Jamuna and the Daokoba. The process has gone on ever since, and Buchanan Hamilton's remarks on the villages of Bengal are specially applicable to this area. He says that "a change in the site of a village 4 or 5 miles causes little inconvenience and is considered no more than a usual casualty, which produces on the people no effect of consequence. Even the rich never put up buildings of a durable nature."</p>
