<h3><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_LSImage_preview" alt="SC Bhuj" />SOS Children's Village Bhuj</h3>
<p>About twice every century, this area is hit by strong earthquakes.&nbsp; 
This has changed its topography by altering river courses and creating 
elevations such as Allah's Bund (Allah's dam). On 26 January 2001, when 
the whole country was busy celebrating Republic Day, such an earthquake 
struck. Within minutes, more than 100,000 people lay trapped under 
debris in the streets or in their homes.</p>
<p>SOS Children India swiftly provided <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/e/Emergency_Appeal.htm">emergency relief</a>.&nbsp; Within 
weeks, 25 child-relief centres had been set up. Over two thousand 
children were provided with day care, medicines and diet 
supplementation. The SOS Child Relief Centres operated for six months, 
until families had been able to re-organise and schools and medical 
centres had been restored in tents.</p>
<p>By then, it had become clear that 
more than a hundred children would need permanent care as they had lost 
both parents or one parent, with the other not being in the position to 
take care of the children alone. As time passed, some children who had 
been taken care of by their extended families were also abandoned. In 
the end, there were 125 children in need of long-term care. Since there 
was no SOS Children's Village in this area, it was decided to set up a 
new one.</p>
<p>The site of the new SOS Children's Village is located on the 
outskirts of Bhuj at Madhapur Township.&nbsp; Next to the village, there is a
 colony for those whose houses were destroyed during the earthquake. 
Before the completion of the SOS Children's Village, twelve of these 
houses were inhabited by the <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Soschildren.htm">children</a> under the care of SOS.</p>
<p>The SOS Children's Village consists of 14 family homes, a community 
house, staff accommodation, and the necessary administration and service
 area. There is an SOS Nursery School, which is also open to children 
from the neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>Other SOS Projects in Bhuj</h3>
<p>Since there is a special need to encourage the education of girls in 
this area, SOS Children's Villages has started an <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Schools.htm">SOS School</a> with a 
small hostel for girls. The school has ten classrooms and provides 
primary education
 to up to 350 pupils.</p>
<p>In order to improve the medical infrastructure of 
the area, an <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Medical_Centres_A.htm">SOS Medical Centre</a>, where people from the neighbourhood can
 come for examinations and treatment as well as counselling, has been 
set up.</p>
<p>In 2004, SOS Children India launched its family strengthening 
programmes in Bhuj. These programmes are intended to support families at
 risk of abandoning their children and to encourage families to stay 
together. SOS Children therefore works with local authorities and other 
service providers to support families and enable them to take good care 
of their children.</p>
<p>The Bhuj <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/f/Family_Strengthening_B.htm">Family Strengthening Programme</a> provides nutritional, educational and health
 support as well as vocational training, career counselling sessions and
 job placement support. Families are linked with existing self-help 
groups; if there is no group, a new one is formed. The programme also 
aims at raising awareness of hygiene and child rights and improving 
people's parenting skills.</p>
<h3>Background to Bhuj<br /></h3>
<p>Bhuj has a population of over 100,000 is a city and a municipality in Kachchh district in the state of Gujarat, <a title="SOS Children in India: Children for Sponsorship in India" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Children_In_India.htm">India</a>. It was established by Rao Hamirji in 1510 and was made the state capital by Rao Khengarji I in 1549. Presently, it is the district headquarter of the Kachchh ditrict, the second largest district in India.</p>
