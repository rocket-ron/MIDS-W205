<p>An example child sponsorship letter from Bogra, Bangladesh:<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Dear <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sponsorachild_A.htm">Sponsors</a>,</em></p>
<p><em><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_AMImage_preview" alt="SOS School Bogra Bangladesh" />At this time of the year, we would like to describe once again concerning latest progress about <a title="Child Sponsorship Background from Bogra, Bangladesh" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/c/Child_Sponsorship_Background_From_Bogra_Bangladesh.htm">SOS Children's Village Bogra</a> and its ancillary projects.<br />SOS
 Children&#x2019;s Village Bogra is located in a bit hilly area and the 
buildings are designed and made appropriate with land pattern. The whole
 area is very lovely and worth seeing. The Village has 10 family houses 
(total 52 boys and 59 girls), community house, community centre, 
co-workers&#x2019; quarters, social centre and a college.</em></p>
<p><em>Most of our children successfully passed their last Annual 
Examination and are doing well with their studies in respective classes.
 All the children, mothers, aunts and co-workers participated in Annual 
Picnic held at Saudia Park, Sherpur, 40 kilometers away from SOS 
Children&#x2019;s Village Bogra. The park is worth seeing and the surrounding 
area of this park bears many historical evidences. Everybody especially 
the children enjoyed the programme and at the same time gathered new and
 rich experiences. The day was a memorable one.</em></p>
<p><em>Our girls 
participated in School Sports Competition of National Level and won
 championship in Volleyball tournament like last year. The news was 
highlighted in all the Daily Newspapers of the country. A girl became champion in National Tennis Competition (below 14) both 
in singles and doubles.</em></p>
<h3><strong>SOS Youth Home</strong></h3>
<p><em>At present, 25 boys are residing in SOS Youth Home Bogra. All the 
boys are attending different educational institutions from class-VI to 
class-XII. Besides, 15 boys are living outside the Village: among them, 
10 boys are studying in different university and colleges, 4 boys are 
studying in Vocational Training Centre Dhaka and another one is taking 
training on tailoring. We have organized different programme for our 
boys to ensure career direction and develop positive vision among them. 
We invited renowned personality from different professions to deliver 
lecture in these programmes. Part time teachers are engaged in special 
coaching from Basic English and Mathematics for our boys. English 
language and Computer training programmes are running smoothly.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>SOS Social Centre</strong></h3>
<p><em>SOS Social Centre Bogra is providing humanitarian services to the 
under privileged mothers and children like SOS-families to the very 
needy families of the community around SOS Children&#x2019;s Village Bogra. SOS
 Social Centre has several programmes like Day Care Centre, Basic 
Clinic, Skill Training Wing, Special Support Programme 
(Incidental/Special case), Emergency Relief Programme, Tree Plantation 
Programme, various awareness Programmes etc.</em></p>
<h3><strong>SOS College</strong></h3>
<p><em>SOS College Bogra was established to provide educational facilities 
to our children as well as pupils of neighboring areas. Owing to the 
brilliant academic and co-curricular performances this has attained 
reputation throughout the country. Every year we experience a mad rush 
of parents and guardians to admit their wards in our College. The 
present number of students in different classes in the College is 632. 
Different important National Days, SOS Day etc. are observed in the 
College with due solemnity.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Family Strengthening Programme</strong></h3>
<p><em>As child welfare organization, SOS Social Centre is pledge bound to ensure the child rights among the beneficiaries through the <a title="Family Strengthening Programmes" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/f/Family_Strengthening_Programmes.htm">Family Strengthening Programme</a>.
 It includes education, health, food-stuff and medical facilities to the
 selected children. We fulfill the demand of educational requirements 
like monthly school fees, examination fees, stationery etc. to the 
beneficiaries. Special coaching for weaker children is provided to cope 
with the school&#x2019;s syllabus. The selected children are vulnerable and 
their caregivers are unable to provide sufficient meals to the children 
even sometimes they have to skip their meal. We fulfill the demand of 
food among selected children by providing rice, salt, lentil and edible 
oil in every month.</em></p>
<p><em>With regards and best wishes.</em></p>
<p><em>Very sincerely yours,</em></p>
<p><em>SOS Children's Village Bogra<br /></em></p>
