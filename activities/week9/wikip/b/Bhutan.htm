It is bordered to the north by <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and to the south, east and west by the <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Republic of India</a>. Further west, it is separated from <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> by the <!--del_lnk--> Indian state of <a href="../../wp/s/Sikkim.htm" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a>, while further south it is separated from <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> by the Indian states of <!--del_lnk--> Assam and <!--del_lnk--> West Bengal. Bhutan's capital and largest city is <!--del_lnk--> Thimphu.</p>
       <p>Bhutan existed as a patchwork of minor warring <!--del_lnk--> fiefdoms until the early 17th century, when the <!--del_lnk--> lama and military leader <!--del_lnk--> Shabdrung <!--del_lnk--> Ngawang Namgyal, fleeing religious persecution in <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, unified the area and cultivated a distinct Bhutanese identity. Later, in the early 20th century, Bhutan came into contact with the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> and retained strong bilateral relations with India upon its independence. In 2006, based on a global survey, <i><!--del_lnk--> Business Week</i> rated Bhutan the <!--del_lnk--> happiest country in Asia and the eighth-happiest in the world.</p>
       <p>Bhutan's landscape ranges from <a href="../../wp/s/Subtropics.htm" title="Subtropics">subtropical</a> plains in the south to the <!--del_lnk--> sub-alpine Himalayan heights in the north, where some peaks exceed <span class="nowrap">7,000 metres (23,000&nbsp;ft)</span>. Its total area was reported as approximately 46,500&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (18,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in 1997 and 38,394 square kilometres (14,824&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in 2002. Bhutan's state religion is <!--del_lnk--> Vajrayana Buddhism and the population, now (as of 2012/2013) estimated to be nearly three-quarters of a million, is predominantly <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a>. <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> is the second-largest religion.</p>
       <p>In 2008, Bhutan made the transition from <!--del_lnk--> absolute monarchy to <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> and held its first general election. As well as being a member of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, Bhutan is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and hosted <!--del_lnk--> SAARC's sixteenth summit in April 2010.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>Names similar to Bhutan&nbsp;&ndash; including <i>Bottanthis</i>, <i>Bottan</i> and <i>Bottanter</i>&nbsp;&ndash; began to appear in Europe around the 1580s. <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste Tavernier's 1676 <i>Six Voyages</i> is the first to record the name <i>Boutan</i>. However, in every case, these seem to have been describing not modern Bhutan but the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Tibet. The modern distinction between the two did not begin until well into <!--del_lnk--> Bogle's 1774 expedition&mdash;realizing the differences between the two regions, cultures, and states, his final report to the <a href="../../wp/e/East_India_Company.htm" title="East India Company">East India Company</a> formally proposed labeling the <!--del_lnk--> Druk Desi's kingdom as "Boutan" and the <!--del_lnk--> Panchen Lama's as "Tibet". The EIC's surveyor general <!--del_lnk--> James Rennell first anglicized the French name as Bootan and then popularized the distinction between it and greater Tibet.</p>
       <p>The precise etymology of "Bhutan" is unknown, although it is likely to derive from the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan <!--del_lnk--> endonym "Bod" used for <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Greater Tibet">Greater Tibet</a>. Traditionally, it is taken to be a transcription of the <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <i>Bho&#x1E6D;a-anta</i> (&#x92D;&#x94B;&#x91F;-&#x905;&#x928;&#x94D;&#x924;, "end of <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>"), a reference to Bhutan's position as the southern extremity of the Tibetan plateau and culture.</p>
       <p>Locally, Bhutan has been known by many names. The earliest western records of Bhutan, the 1627 <i>Rela&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> of the <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese <!--del_lnk--> Jesuits <!--del_lnk--> Est&ecirc;v&atilde;o Cacella and <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o Cabral, records its name variously as <i>Cambirasi</i> (among the <!--del_lnk--> Koch Biharis), <i>Potente</i>, and <i>Mon</i> (an endonym for southern Tibet). The first time a separate Kingdom of Bhutan did appear on a western map, it did so under its local name as "Broukpa". Others including <i>Lho Mon</i> ("Dark Southland"), <i>Lho Tsendenjong</i> ("Southland of the <!--del_lnk--> Cypress"), <i>Lhomen Khazhi</i> ("Southland of the Four Approaches") and <i>Lho Men Jong</i> ("Southland of the <!--del_lnk--> Herbs).</p>

       <p>Stone tools, weapons, <a href="../../wp/e/Elephant.htm" title="Elephant">elephants</a>, and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that Bhutan was inhabited as early as 2000 BC, although there are no existing records from that time. Historians have theorized that the state of <i>Lhomon</i> (literally, "southern darkness"), or <i>Monyul</i> ("Dark Land", a reference to the <!--del_lnk--> Monpa, the <!--del_lnk--> aboriginal peoples of Bhutan) may have existed between 500 BC and AD 600. The names <i>Lhomon Tsendenjong</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Sandalwood Country), and <i>Lhomon Khashi</i>, or Southern Mon (country of four approaches), have been found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles.</p>

       <p>Buddhism was first introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century AD. Tibetan king <!--del_lnk--> Songts&auml;n Gampo (reigned 627&ndash;649), a convert to Buddhism, who actually had extended the Tibetan Empire into Sikkim and Bhutan, ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples, at <!--del_lnk--> Bumthang in central Bhutan and at Kyichu (near <!--del_lnk--> Paro) in the <!--del_lnk--> Paro Valley. Buddhism was propagated in earnest in 746 under King Sindhu R&#x101;ja (<i>also</i> K&uuml;njom; Sendha Gyab; Chakhar Gyalpo), an exiled <!--del_lnk--> Indian king who had established a government in Bumthang at Chakhar Gutho Palace. </p>

       <p>Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> saint <!--del_lnk--> Padma Sambhava (also known as <!--del_lnk--> Guru Rinpoche) came to Bhutan in 747. Much of early Bhutanese history is unclear because most of the records were destroyed when fire ravaged the ancient capital, <!--del_lnk--> Punakha, in 1827. By the 10th century, Bhutan's political development was heavily influenced by its religious history. Various sub-sects of Buddhism emerged which were patronized by the various <!--del_lnk--> Mongol warlords. After the decline of the <a href="../../wp/y/Yuan_Dynasty.htm" title="Yuan Dynasty">Yuan Dynasty</a> in the 14th century, these sub-sects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape, eventually leading to the ascendancy of the <!--del_lnk--> Drukpa sub-sect by the 16th century.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Until the early 17th century, Bhutan existed as a patchwork of minor warring <!--del_lnk--> fiefdoms, when the area was unified by the Tibetan lama and military leader <!--del_lnk--> Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal who had fled religious persecution in Tibet. To defend the country against intermittent Tibetan forays, Namgyal built a network of impregnable <i><!--del_lnk--> dzong</i> (fortresses), and <!--del_lnk--> promulgated the <!--del_lnk--> Tsa Yig, a code of law that helped to bring local lords under centralized control. Many such <i>dzong</i> still exist and are active centers of religion and district administration. <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese <!--del_lnk--> Jesuits <!--del_lnk--> Est&ecirc;v&atilde;o Cacella and <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o Cabral were the first recorded Europeans to visit Bhutan, on their way to Tibet. They met Ngawang Namgyal, presented him with firearms, <a href="../../wp/g/Gunpowder.htm" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> and a <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescope</a>, and offered him their services in the war against Tibet, but the Shabdrung declined the offer. After a stay of nearly eight months Cacella wrote a long letter from the <!--del_lnk--> Chagri Monastery reporting on his travels. This is a rare extant report of the Shabdrung. After Ngawang Namgyal's death in 1651, his passing was kept secret for 54 years; after a period of consolidation, Bhutan lapsed into internal conflict. In the year 1711 Bhutan went to war against the <a href="../../wp/m/Mughal_Empire.htm" title="Mughal Empire">Mughal Empire</a> and its <!--del_lnk--> Subedars, who restored <!--del_lnk--> Koch Bihar in the south. During the chaos that followed, the Tibetans unsuccessfully attacked Bhutan in 1714.</p>
       <p>In the 18th century, the Bhutanese invaded and occupied the kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Cooch Behar to the south. In 1772, Cooch Behar appealed to the <a href="../../wp/k/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain.htm" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">British</a> <a href="../../wp/e/East_India_Company.htm" title="East India Company">East India Company</a> which assisted them in ousting the Bhutanese and later in attacking Bhutan itself in 1774. A peace treaty was signed in which Bhutan agreed to retreat to its pre-1730 borders. However, the peace was tenuous, and border skirmishes with the <!--del_lnk--> British were to continue for the next hundred years. The skirmishes eventually led to the <!--del_lnk--> Duar War (1864&ndash;65), a confrontation for control of the <!--del_lnk--> Bengal <!--del_lnk--> Duars. After Bhutan lost the war, the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Sinchula was signed between <!--del_lnk--> British India and Bhutan. As part of the <!--del_lnk--> war reparations, the Duars were ceded to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland.htm" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom</a> in exchange for a rent of Rs. 50,000. The treaty ended all hostilities between British India and Bhutan.</p>
       <p>During the 1870s, power struggles between the rival valleys of <!--del_lnk--> Paro and <!--del_lnk--> Tongsa led to civil war in Bhutan, eventually leading to the ascendancy of <!--del_lnk--> Ugyen Wangchuck, the <i>ponlop</i> (governor) of Tongsa. From his power base in central Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions during 1882&ndash;85.</p>
       <p>In 1907, an epochal year for the country, Ugyen Wangchuck was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by an assembly of leading Buddhist monks, government officials, and heads of important families. The British government promptly recognized the new monarchy, and in 1910 Bhutan signed the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Punakha, a <!--del_lnk--> subsidiary alliance which gave the British control of Bhutan's foreign affairs and meant that Bhutan was treated as an Indian <!--del_lnk--> princely state. This had little real effect, given Bhutan's historical reticence, and also did not appear to affect Bhutan's traditional relations with Tibet. After the new <!--del_lnk--> Union of India gained <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Indian_independence_movement.htm" title="Independence of India">independence</a> from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, Bhutan became one of the first countries to recognize India's independence. On 8 August 1949, a treaty similar to that of 1910, in which Britain had gained power over Bhutan's foreign relations, was signed with the newly independent India.</p>
       <p>In 1953, King <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Dorji Wangchuck established the country's legislature &ndash; a 130-member <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly &ndash; to promote a more democratic form of governance. In 1965, he set up a Royal Advisory Council, and in 1968 he formed a Cabinet. In 1971, Bhutan was admitted to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, having held observer status for three years. In July 1972, Jigme Singye Wangchuck ascended to the throne at the age of sixteen after the death of his father, Dorji Wangchuck.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_reform_and_modernization">Political reform and modernization</span></h3>
       <p>King <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Singye Wangchuck introduced significant political reforms, transferring most of his administrative powers to the Council of Cabinet Ministers and allowing for <!--del_lnk--> impeachment of the King by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly.</p>
       <p>In 1999, the government lifted a ban on <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> and the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>, making Bhutan one of the last countries to introduce television. In his speech, the King said that television was a critical step to the <!--del_lnk--> modernisation of Bhutan as well as a major contributor to the country's <!--del_lnk--> Gross National Happiness (Bhutan is the only country to measure happiness), but warned that the "misuse" of television could erode traditional Bhutanese values.</p>
       <p>A new <!--del_lnk--> constitution was presented in early 2005. In December 2005, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck announced that he would <!--del_lnk--> abdicate the throne in his son's favour in 2008. On 14 December 2006, he announced that he would be abdicating immediately. This was followed by the first national <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary elections in <!--del_lnk--> December 2007 and <!--del_lnk--> March 2008.</p>
       <p>On 6 November 2008, 28-year-old <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, eldest son of King <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Singye Wangchuck, was crowned King.</p>

       <p>Bhutan's political system has developed from an <!--del_lnk--> absolute monarchy into a <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>. In 1999, the fourth king of Bhutan created a body called the <!--del_lnk--> Lhengye Zhungtshog (Council of Ministers). The <i><!--del_lnk--> Druk Gyalpo</i> (King of Druk Yul) is <!--del_lnk--> head of state. <!--del_lnk--> Executive power is exercised by the Lhengye Zhungtshog, the council of ministers. <!--del_lnk--> Legislative power was vested in both the <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a> and the former <!--del_lnk--> Grand National Assembly.</p>
       <p>On the 17th of December 2005, the 4th King, <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Singye Wangchuck, announced to a stunned nation that the first general elections would be held in 2008 and that he would abdicate the throne in favour of his eldest son, the crown prince. King <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck took the throne on December 14, 2006 upon his father's abdication. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck was adorned with Bhutan's Raven Crown at an ornate coronation ceremony in Thimphu on Thursday, November 6, 2008, becoming the world's youngest reigning monarch and head of the newest democracy.</p>
       <p>The new political system comprises an upper and lower house, the latter based on political party affiliations. Elections for the upper house (<!--del_lnk--> National Council) were held on <!--del_lnk--> 31 December, 2007 and on <!--del_lnk--> 23 April 2013, while <!--del_lnk--> elections for the lower house, the 47-seat <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly, were held on March 24, 2008. Two political parties, the <!--del_lnk--> People's Democratic Party (PDP) headed by <!--del_lnk--> Sangay Ngedup, and the <!--del_lnk--> Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT) headed by <!--del_lnk--> Jigmi Thinley, competed in the National Assembly election. The Druk Phuensum Tshogpa won the elections taking 45 out of 47 seats in the parliament.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Judicial power is vested in the <!--del_lnk--> courts of Bhutan. The <!--del_lnk--> Chief Justice is the <!--del_lnk--> administrative head of the <!--del_lnk--> Judiciary.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Military_and_foreign_affairs">Military and foreign affairs</span></h3>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bhutan Army is Bhutan's military service. It includes the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bodyguard and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bhutan Police. Membership is voluntary and the minimum age for recruitment is 18. The standing army numbers about 16,000 and is trained by the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Army. It has an annual budget of about <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="USD">$</a>13.7 million (1.8 percent of <a href="../../wp/g/Gross_domestic_product.htm" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a>). Being a <!--del_lnk--> landlocked country, Bhutan has no navy. It also has no air force or army aviation corps. The Army relies on the Eastern Air Command of the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Air Force for air assistance.</p>
       <p>Bhutan maintains strong economic, strategic and military relations with neighbouring India. In 2007, Bhutan and India signed a new treaty that clarified Bhutan's own control over its foreign relations. This superseded the treaty signed in 1949. The previous treaty is still sometimes taken to mean that India controls Bhutan's foreign affairs, but the government of Bhutan handles all of its own foreign affairs, including issues in which India has a vested interest, such as Bhutan's border with China.</p>
       <p>Bhutan has diplomatic relations with 21 countries and the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> and has missions in India, <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and <a href="../../wp/k/Kuwait.htm" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>.

       <p>By a long-standing agreement, Indian and Bhutanese citizens may travel to each other's countries without the need for a <!--del_lnk--> passport or <!--del_lnk--> visa but only their national identity cards. Bhutanese citizens may also work in India without legal restriction. Bhutan does not have formal diplomatic ties with its northern neighbour, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>, although exchanges of visits at various levels between the two have significantly increased in recent times. The first bilateral agreement between China and Bhutan was signed in 1998 and Bhutan has also set up honorary consulates in <a href="../../wp/m/Macau.htm" title="Macau">Macau</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Bhutan's border with China is largely not demarcated and thus disputed in some places. Approximately 269 square kilometers remain under discussion between China and Bhutan.</p>
       <p>On 13 November 2005, Chinese soldiers crossed into the disputed territories between China and Bhutan, and began building roads and bridges. Bhutanese Foreign Minister <!--del_lnk--> Khandu Wangchuk took up the matter with Chinese authorities after the issue was raised in the Bhutanese parliament. In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang of the People's Republic of China has said that the border remains in dispute and that the two sides are continuing to work for a peaceful and cordial resolution of the dispute. An Indian intelligence officer has said that a Chinese delegation in Bhutan told the Bhutanese that they were "overreacting." The Bhutanese newspaper <i>Kuensel</i> has said that China might use the roads to further Chinese claims along the border.</p>
       <p>On 8 February 2007, the Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty was substantially revised. The Treaty of 1949, Article 2 states: "The Government of India undertakes to exercise no interference in the internal administration of Bhutan. On its part the Government of Bhutan agrees to be guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations." In the revised treaty it now reads as "In keeping with the abiding ties of close friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and India, the Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan and the Government of the Republic of India shall cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other." The revised treaty also includes this preamble: "Reaffirming their respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity", an element that was absent in the earlier version. The Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty of 2007 clarifies Bhutan's status as an independent and sovereign nation.</p>
       <p>Bhutan maintains formal <!--del_lnk--> diplomatic relations with several <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asian</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> nations, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>.

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In the 1990s, Bhutan expelled or forced to leave nearly one-fifth of its population in the name of preserving its Tibetan Mahayana Buddhist culture and identity, claiming that those expelled were illegal residents. The decision was motivated by the concern that the fast growing Nepali minority would take over the country, recalling similar events that caused the collapse of the nearby kingdom of Sikkim in 1975. The <!--del_lnk--> Lhotshampas, the dissidents, were allegedly subjected to harassment and arrests. An alleged harassment campaign escalating in the early 1990s ensued, and afterwards Bhutanese security forces began expelling people after making them renounce claims to their homes and homeland. Due to the violence, Bhutanese of Nepali origin, mainly Hindu, fled. According to the <!--del_lnk--> UNHCR, more than 107,000 <!--del_lnk--> Bhutanese refugees living in seven camps in eastern) <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> have been documented as of 2008. After many years in refugee camps, many inhabitants are now moving to host nations such as Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States as refugees. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> has admitted 30,870 refugees from fiscal years 2008 through 2010.</p>
       <p>The government does not permit citizenship for Bhutanese refugees, so most of them have become stateless refugees. Excessive bureaucratic obstacles have been used to hinder their relatives from getting ID cards and voting rights. Bhutan considers the political parties of these refugees illegal and terrorist in nature. Human rights groups claimed the government interfered with individual rights by requiring all citizens, including ethnic minority members, to wear the traditional dress of the ethnic majority in public places. However, the government strictly enforced the law only in Buddhist religious buildings, government offices, schools, official functions, and public ceremonies.</p>

       <p>Bhutan is located on the southern slopes of the eastern <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, landlocked between the <!--del_lnk--> Tibet Autonomous Region to the north and the Indian states of <a href="../../wp/s/Sikkim.htm" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a>, <!--del_lnk--> West Bengal, <!--del_lnk--> Assam and <!--del_lnk--> Arunachal Pradesh to the west and south. It lies between latitudes <!--del_lnk--> 26&deg; and <!--del_lnk--> 29&deg;N, and longitudes <!--del_lnk--> 88&deg; and <!--del_lnk--> 93&deg;E. The land consists mostly of steep and high <!--del_lnk--> mountains crisscrossed by a network of swift rivers, which form deep valleys before draining into the Indian plains. Elevation rises from 200&nbsp;m (660&nbsp;ft) in the southern foothills to more than 7,000&nbsp;m (23,000&nbsp;ft). This great geographical diversity combined with equally diverse climate conditions contributes to Bhutan's outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems.</p>
       <p>The northern region of the country consists of an arc of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows reaching up to glaciated mountain peaks with an extremely cold climate at the highest elevations. Most peaks in the north are over 7,000&nbsp;m (23,000&nbsp;ft) above sea level; the highest point in Bhutan is <!--del_lnk--> Gangkhar Puensum at 7,570 metres (24,840&nbsp;ft), which has the distinction of being the <!--del_lnk--> highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The lowest point, at 98&nbsp;m (322&nbsp;ft), is in the valley of <!--del_lnk--> Drangme Chhu, where the river crosses the border with India. Watered by snow-fed rivers, alpine valleys in this region provide <!--del_lnk--> pasture for livestock, tended by a sparse population of migratory shepherds.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Black Mountains in the central region of Bhutan form a watershed between two major river systems: the <!--del_lnk--> Mo Chhu and the Drangme Chhu. Peaks in the Black Mountains range between 1,500 and 4,925 m (4,900 and 16,158 ft) above sea level, and fast-flowing rivers have carved out deep gorges in the lower mountain areas. The forests of the central Bhutan mountains consist of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests in higher elevations and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests in lower elevations. Woodlands of the central region provide most of Bhutan's forest production. The <!--del_lnk--> Torsa, <!--del_lnk--> Raidak, <!--del_lnk--> Sankosh, and <!--del_lnk--> Manas are the main rivers of Bhutan, flowing through this region. Most of the population lives in the central highlands.</p>
       <p>In the south, the <!--del_lnk--> Shiwalik Hills are covered with dense <!--del_lnk--> Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests, alluvial lowland river valleys, and mountains up to around 1,500&nbsp;m (4,900&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The foothills descend into the subtropical <!--del_lnk--> Duars Plain. Most of the Duars is located in India, although a 10 to 15 km (6.2 to 9.3 mi) wide strip extends into Bhutan. The Bhutan Duars is divided into two parts: the northern and the southern Duars. The northern Duars, which abuts the Himalayan foothills, has rugged, sloping terrain and dry, <!--del_lnk--> porous soil with dense vegetation and abundant wildlife. The southern Duars has moderately fertile soil, heavy <!--del_lnk--> savannah grass, dense, mixed jungle, and freshwater springs. Mountain rivers, fed by either the melting snow or the monsoon rains, empty into the <a href="../../wp/b/Brahmaputra_River.htm" title="Brahmaputra River">Brahmaputra River</a> in India. Data released by the Ministry of Agriculture showed that the country had a forest cover of 64% as of October 2005.</p>
       <p>The climate in Bhutan varies with elevation, from subtropical in the south to <!--del_lnk--> temperate in the highlands and <!--del_lnk--> polar-type climate, with year-round snow in the north. Bhutan experiences five distinct seasons: summer, <!--del_lnk--> monsoon, autumn, winter and spring. Western Bhutan has the heavier monsoon rains; southern Bhutan has hot humid summers and cool winters; central and eastern Bhutan is temperate and drier than the west with warm summers and cool winters.</p>

       <p>Bhutan is divided into twenty <i><!--del_lnk--> dzongkhags</i> (districts), administered by a body called the Dzongkhag Tshogdu. In certain <i><!--del_lnk--> thromdes</i> (urban municipalities), a further municipal administration is directly subordinate to the Dzongkhag administration. In the vast majority of constituencies, rural <i><!--del_lnk--> gewogs</i> (village blocks) are administered by bodies called the Gewog Tshogde.</p>
       <p>Thromdes (municipalities) elect Thrompons to lead administration, who in turn represent the Thromde in the Dzongkhag Tshogdu. Likewise, gewogs elect headmen called <i>gups</i>, vice-headmen called <i>mangmis</i>, who also sit on the Dzongkhag Thshogdu, as well as other members of the Gewog Tshogde. The basis of electoral constituencies in Bhutan is the <i><!--del_lnk--> chiwog</i>, a subdivision of gewogs delineated by the Election Commission.</p>

       <p>Bhutan signed the Rio <!--del_lnk--> Convention on Biological Diversity on 11 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 25 August 1995. It has subsequently produced a <!--del_lnk--> National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, with two revisions, the most recent of which was received by the convention on 4 February 2010.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Animals">Animals</span></h3>
       <p>Bhutan has a rich primate life, with rare species such as the <!--del_lnk--> golden langur. Recently, a variant Assamese macaque, which is also regarded by some authorities as a new species, <i>Macaca munzala</i>, has also been recorded.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Bengal tiger, <!--del_lnk--> greater one-horned rhinoceros, <!--del_lnk--> clouded leopard, <!--del_lnk--> hispid hare and the <!--del_lnk--> sloth bear live in the lush tropical lowland and hardwood forests in the south. In the temperate zone, <!--del_lnk--> grey langur, tiger, <!--del_lnk--> Indian leopard, <!--del_lnk--> goral and <!--del_lnk--> serow are found in mixed conifer, broadleaf and pine forests. Fruit bearing trees and bamboo provide habitat for the <!--del_lnk--> Himalayan black bear, <a href="../../wp/r/Red_panda.htm" title="Red panda">red panda</a>, <!--del_lnk--> squirrel, <!--del_lnk--> sambar, <!--del_lnk--> wild pig and <!--del_lnk--> barking deer. The alpine habitats of the great Himalayan range in the north are home to the <!--del_lnk--> snow leopard, <!--del_lnk--> blue sheep, <!--del_lnk--> marmot, <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan wolf, <a href="../../wp/a/Antelope.htm" title="Antelope">antelope</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Himalayan musk deer and the <!--del_lnk--> takin, Bhutan's <!--del_lnk--> national animal. The endangered wild water buffalo occurs in southern Bhutan, although in small numbers.</p>
       <p>More than 770 species of bird have been recorded in the kingdom. The globally endangered <!--del_lnk--> White-winged Duck has been added recently to Bhutan's bird list.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fungi">Fungi</span></h3>
       <p>The number of fungi occurring in Bhutan, including lichen-forming species, is not known but is undoubtedly large, with many species yet to be discovered. Fungi form a key part of Bhutanese ecosystems, with mycorrhizal species providing forest trees with mineral nutrients necessary for growth, and with wood decay and litter decomposing species playing an important role in natural recycling. One fungus particularly important in Bhutan is <i><!--del_lnk--> Ophiocordyceps sinensis</i>. This fungus is found in meadows at higher altitudes where it parasitizes and kills a particular species of moth as it pupates while buried in the ground. The fruitbodies grow out from the moth cadaver and emerge among the plants of the meadow, reaching a total height of a few centimetres. The fungus is important because of its enormous value in traditional Chinese medicine, and it is one of very few organisms other than animals to have been specifically listed in Bhutan's national biodiversity strategy and action plan.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Plants">Plants</span></h3>
       <p>More than 5,400 species of plants are known to occur throughout the kingdom.</p>

       <p>The Eastern <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> have been identified as a global <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a> hotspot and counted among the 234 globally outstanding <!--del_lnk--> ecoregions of the world in a comprehensive analysis of global biodiversity undertaken by <a href="../../wp/w/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature.htm" title="World Wide Fund for Nature">WWF</a> between 1995 and 1997.</p>
       <p>Bhutan is seen as a model for proactive <!--del_lnk--> conservation initiatives. The Kingdom has received international acclaim for its commitment to the maintenance of its biodiversity. This is reflected in the decision to maintain at least sixty percent of the land area under <a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">forest</a> cover, to designate more than 40% of its territory as national parks, reserves and other protected areas, and most recently to identify a further nine percent of land area as biodiversity corridors linking the protected areas. Environmental conservation has been placed at the core of the nation's development strategy, the middle path. It is not treated as a sector but rather as a set of concerns that must be mainstreamed in Bhutan's overall approach to development planning and to be buttressed by the force of law.</p>

       <p>Pressures on the natural environment are already evident and will be fuelled by a complex array of forces. They include population pressures, agricultural modernisation, poaching, hydro-power development, mineral extraction, industrialisation, urbanisation, sewage and waste disposal, tourism, competition for available land road construction and the provision of other physical infrastructure associated with social and economic development.</p>
       <p>Policy implementation needs to be continually improved. Sustainable rural livelihoods that do not rely solely upon natural resource use need to be developed and supported, and there needs to be far wider understanding of the environmental threats that come hand in hand with development, to ensure the future of Bhutan's rich and diverse environment.</p>
       <p>In practice, the overlap of these extensive protected lands with populated areas has led to mutual habitat encroachment. Protected wildlife has entered agricultural areas, trampling crops and killing livestock. In response, Bhutan has implemented an insurance scheme, begun constructing solar powered alarm fences, watch towers, and search lights, and has provided fodder and salt licks outside human settlement areas to encourage animals to stay away.</p>
       <p>The huge market value of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Ophiocordyceps sinensis</i> fungus crop collected from the wild has also resulted in unsustainable exploitation which is proving very difficult to regulate.</p>

       <p>Bhutan's currency is the <!--del_lnk--> ngultrum, whose value is <!--del_lnk--> fixed to the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_rupee.htm" title="Indian rupee">Indian rupee</a>. The rupee is also accepted as <!--del_lnk--> legal tender in the country.</p>
       <p>Though Bhutan's economy is one of the world's smallest, it has grown rapidly in recent years, by eight percent in 2005 and 14 percent in 2006. In 2007, Bhutan had the second fastest growing <!--del_lnk--> economy in the world, with an annual economic growth rate of 22.4 percent. This was mainly due to the commissioning of the gigantic <!--del_lnk--> Tala <!--del_lnk--> Hydroelectricity project. As of March 2006, Bhutan's <!--del_lnk--> per capita income was US$1,321.</p>
       <p>Bhutan's economy is based on <!--del_lnk--> agriculture, forestry, tourism and the sale of <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectric power to India. Agriculture provides the main livelihood for more than 80 percent of the population. <!--del_lnk--> Agrarian practices consist largely of <!--del_lnk--> subsistence farming and <!--del_lnk--> animal husbandry. Handicrafts, particularly weaving and the manufacture of religious art for home altars, are a small <!--del_lnk--> cottage industry. A landscape that varies from hilly to ruggedly mountainous has made the building of roads and other <a href="../../wp/i/Infrastructure.htm" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a> difficult and expensive. This, and a lack of access to the sea, has meant that Bhutan has not been able to benefit from significant trading of its produce. Bhutan does not have any <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">railways</a>, though <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Railways.htm" title="Indian Railways">Indian Railways</a> plans to link southern Bhutan to its vast network under an agreement signed in January 2005. Bhutan and India signed a 'free trade' accord in 2008, which additionally allowed Bhutanese imports and exports from third markets to transit India without <!--del_lnk--> tariffs. Bhutan had trade relations with the <!--del_lnk--> Tibet region until 1960, when it closed its border with China after an influx of refugees.</p>
       <p>The industrial sector is in a nascent stage, and though most production comes from cottage industry, larger industries are being encouraged and some industries such as <!--del_lnk--> cement, <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> ferroalloy have been set up. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian contract labour. Agricultural produce includes rice, chilies, dairy (some yak, mostly cow) products, buckwheat, barley, root crops, apples, and citrus and maize at lower elevations. Industries include cement, <a href="../../wp/w/Wood.htm" title="Wood">wood</a> products, processed fruits, alcoholic beverages and <!--del_lnk--> calcium carbide.</p>
       <p>Incomes of over <!--del_lnk--> Nu 100,000 <!--del_lnk--> per annum are taxed, but very few wage and salary earners qualify. Bhutan's inflation rate was estimated at about three percent in 2003. Bhutan has a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gross_domestic_product.htm" title="Gross Domestic Product">Gross Domestic Product</a> of around <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="US Dollar">USD</a> 2.913 billion (adjusted to <!--del_lnk--> Purchasing Power Parity), making it the 162nd largest economy in the world. Per capita income is around $1,400, ranked 124th. Government revenues total $272 million, though expenditures amount to $350 million. 60 percent of the budget expenditure, however, is financed by India's Ministry of External Affairs. Bhutan's exports, principally electricity, <!--del_lnk--> cardamom, <a href="../../wp/g/Gypsum.htm" title="Gypsum">gypsum</a>, <!--del_lnk--> timber, handicrafts, cement, fruit, precious stones and <!--del_lnk--> spices, total <!--del_lnk--> &euro;128 million (2000 est.). Imports, however, amount to &euro;164 million, leading to a <!--del_lnk--> trade deficit. Main items imported include <!--del_lnk--> fuel and <!--del_lnk--> lubricants, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Grain">grain</a>, <!--del_lnk--> machinery, vehicles, fabrics and <a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">rice</a>. Bhutan's main export partner is India, accounting for 58.6 percent of its export goods. <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> (30.1 percent) and <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> (7.3 percent) are the other two top export partners. As its border with Tibet is closed, trade between Bhutan and China is now almost non-existent. Bhutan's import partners include India (74.5 percent), Japan (7.4 percent) and Sweden (3.2 percent).</p>

       <p>Bhutanese people primarily consist of the <!--del_lnk--> Ngalops and <!--del_lnk--> Sharchops, called the Western Bhutanese and Eastern Bhutanese respectively. The <!--del_lnk--> Lhotshampa, meaning "southerners", are a heterogeneous group of mostly <!--del_lnk--> Nepali descent. It was claimed they constituted 45% of the population in 1988 census, include migrants from as early as the 1890s to as recent as the 1980s, who have fought a bitter war with Bhutan over rights to abode, language, and dress, there has been a mass emigration from Bhutan (both forced and voluntary) resulting in hundreds of thousands of people <!--del_lnk--> stateless in <!--del_lnk--> refugee camps. The Ngalops primarily consist of Bhutanese living in the western part of the country. Their culture is closely related to that of Tibet. Much the same could be said of the Sharchops, the dominant group, who traditionally follow the <!--del_lnk--> Nyingmapa rather than the official <!--del_lnk--> Drukpa Kagyu form of <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism. In modern times, with improved transportation infrastructure, there has been much intermarriage between these groups. In the early 1970s, intermarriage between the <!--del_lnk--> Lhotshampas and mainstream Bhutanese society was encouraged by the government, but after the late 1980s, the Bhutanese government forced about 108,000 Lhotshampas from their homes, seized their land, and expelled them to refugee camps.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/l/Literacy.htm" title="Literacy">literacy rate</a> in Bhutan is 59.5 percent. The country has a median age of 24.8 years.

About one-quarter to one-third are followers of <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>. Other religions account for less than 1% of the population. The current legal framework, in principle guarantees <!--del_lnk--> freedom of religion; <!--del_lnk--> proselytism, however, is forbidden by a royal government decision and by judicial interpretation of the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution.</p>
       <p>Buddhism was introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century AD. Tibetan king <!--del_lnk--> Songts&auml;n Gampo (reigned 627&ndash;649), a convert to Buddhism, ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples, at <!--del_lnk--> BumthangJampa Lhakhang in central Bhutan and at Kyichu Lhakhang (near <!--del_lnk--> Paro) in the <!--del_lnk--> Paro Valley.</p>

       <p>The national language is Bhutanese (<!--del_lnk--> Dzongkha), one of 53 languages in the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan language family. The script, here called <i>Chhokey</i> ("Dharma Language"), is identical to classical Tibetan. In the schools English is the medium of instruction and Dzongkha is taught as the national language. <!--del_lnk--> Ethnologue lists 24 languages currently spoken in Bhutan, all of them in the <!--del_lnk--> Tibeto-Burman family, except <!--del_lnk--> Nepali, an <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryan language. Until the 1980s, the government sponsored the teaching of Nepali in schools in Southern Bhutan. However, after the armed uprising in the south, Nepali was dropped from the curriculum. The languages of Bhutan are still not well-characterized, and several have yet to be recorded in an in-depth academic grammar. Before the 1980s, the <!--del_lnk--> Lhotshampa (Nepali-speaking community), mainly based in southern Bhutan, constituted approximately 30% of the population.</p>
       <p>Dzongkha is partially intelligible with <!--del_lnk--> Sikkimese and spoken natively by 25% of the population. <!--del_lnk--> Tshangla, the language of the Sharchop and the principal pre-Tibetan language of Bhutan, is spoken by a greater number of people. It is not easily classified and may constitute an independent branch of Tibeto-Burman. <!--del_lnk--> Nepali speakers constituted some 40% of the population as of 2006. The larger minority languages are <!--del_lnk--> Dzala (11%), <!--del_lnk--> Limbu (10%, immigrant), and <!--del_lnk--> Kheng (8%). There are no reliable sources for the ethnic or linguistic composition of Bhutan, so these numbers do not add up to 100%.</p>

       <p>Bhutan has a rich and unique cultural heritage that has largely remained intact because of its isolation from the rest of the world until the early 1960s. One of the main attractions for tourists is the country's culture and traditions. Bhutanese tradition is deeply steeped in its Buddhist heritage. <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> is the second dominant religion in Bhutan, being most prevalent in the southern regions. The government is increasingly making efforts to preserve and sustain the current culture and traditions of the country. Because of its largely unspoiled natural environment and cultural heritage, Bhutan has been referred to as <i>The Last <!--del_lnk--> Shangri-la</i>.</p>
       <p>While Bhutanese citizens are free to travel abroad, Bhutan is viewed as inaccessible by many foreigners. Another reason for it being an unpopular destination is the cost, which is high for tourists on tighter budgets. Entry is free for citizens of India and Bangladesh, but all other foreigners are required to sign up with a Bhutanese tour operator and pay around US$250 per day that they stay in the country, though this fee covers most travel, lodging and meal expenses. Bhutan received 37,482 visitor arrivals in 2011, of which 25% were for <!--del_lnk--> Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing, Exhibitions.</p>
       <p>The national dress for Bhutanese men is the <i><!--del_lnk--> gho</i>, a knee-length robe tied at the waist by a cloth belt known as the <i>kera</i>. Women wear an ankle-length dress, the <i><!--del_lnk--> kira</i>, which is clipped at the shoulders with two identical broaches called the <i>koma</i> and tied at the waist with kera. An accompaniment to the kira is a long-sleeved blouse, the <i>wonju</i> which is worn underneath the kira. A long-sleeved jacket-like garment, the <i>toego</i> is worn over the kira. The sleeves of the wonju and the tego are folded together at the cuffs, inside out. Social status and class determine the texture, colours, and decorations that embellish the garments. Differently coloured scarves, known as <i>rachu</i> for women (red is the most common colour) and <i>kabney</i> for men, are important indicators of social standing, as Bhutan has traditionally been a <!--del_lnk--> feudal society. Jewellery is mostly worn by women, especially during religious festivals (<!--del_lnk--> tsechus) and public gatherings. To strengthen Bhutan's identity as an independent country, Bhutanese law requires all Bhutanese government employees to wear the national dress at work and all citizens to wear the national dress while visiting schools and other government offices though many citizens, particularly adults, choose to wear the customary dress as formal attire.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">Rice</a>, <!--del_lnk--> buckwheat, and increasingly <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">maize</a>, are the staples of <!--del_lnk--> Bhutanese cuisine. The local diet also includes <!--del_lnk--> pork, <a href="../../wp/b/Beef.htm" title="Beef">beef</a>, <a href="../../wp/y/Yak.htm" title="Yak">yak</a> meat, <a href="../../wp/c/Chicken.htm" title="Chicken">chicken</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> mutton. Soups and stews of meat and dried vegetables spiced with chillies and cheese are prepared. <i>Ema datshi,</i> made very spicy with <a href="../../wp/c/Cheese.htm" title="Cheese">cheese</a> and <!--del_lnk--> chilies, might be called the national dish for its ubiquity and the pride that Bhutanese have for it. <!--del_lnk--> Dairy foods, particularly <a href="../../wp/b/Butter.htm" title="Butter">butter</a> and cheese from yaks and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cow">cows</a>, are also popular, and indeed almost all milk is turned to butter and cheese. Popular beverages include <!--del_lnk--> butter tea, <a href="../../wp/t/Tea.htm" title="Tea">tea</a>, locally brewed <i><!--del_lnk--> ara</i> (<!--del_lnk--> rice wine) and <a href="../../wp/b/Beer.htm" title="Beer">beer</a>. Bhutan is the first country in the world to have banned the sale of <a href="../../wp/t/Tobacco.htm" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> under its <!--del_lnk--> Tobacco Act of 2010.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Bhutanese architecture remains distinctively traditional, employing <!--del_lnk--> rammed earth and <!--del_lnk--> wattle and daub construction methods, stone masonry, and intricate woodwork around windows and roofs. Traditional architecture uses no nails or iron bars in construction. Characteristic of the region is a type of castle fortress known as the <!--del_lnk--> dzong. Since ancient times, the dzongs have served as the religious and secular administration centres for their respective districts. The <!--del_lnk--> University of Texas at El Paso in the United States has adopted Bhutanese architecture for its buildings on campus, as have the nearby Hilton Garden Inn and other buildings in the city of El Paso.</p>
       <p>Bhutan has <!--del_lnk--> numerous public holidays, most of which centre around traditional seasonal, secular and religious festivals. They include the <!--del_lnk--> winter solstice (around January 1, depending on the <!--del_lnk--> lunar calendar), the lunar New Year (February or March), the King's birthday and the anniversary of his coronation, the official end of <!--del_lnk--> monsoon season (September 22), National Day (December 17), and various Buddhist and Hindu celebrations.</p>
       <p>Masked dances and dance dramas are common traditional features at festivals, usually accompanied by traditional music. Energetic dancers, wearing colourful wooden or composition face masks and stylized costumes, depict <!--del_lnk--> heroes, <!--del_lnk--> demons, <!--del_lnk--> d&aelig;mons, death heads, animals, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Deity.htm" title="Gods">gods</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> caricatures of common people. The dancers enjoy royal patronage, and preserve ancient <!--del_lnk--> folk and religious customs and perpetuate the ancient lore and art of mask-making.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> music of Bhutan can generally be divided into traditional and modern varieties; traditional music comprises religious and folk genres, the latter including <i><!--del_lnk--> zhungdra</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> boedra</i>. The modern <i><!--del_lnk--> rigsar</i> is played on a mix of traditional instruments and electronic keyboards, and dates back to the early 1990s; it shows the influence of Indian popular music, a hybrid form of traditional and Western popular influences.</p>
       <p>In Bhutanese families, inheritance generally passes through the female rather than the male line. Daughters will inherit their parents' house. A man is expected to make his own way in the world and often moves to his wife's home. <!--del_lnk--> Love marriages are common in urban areas, but the tradition of <!--del_lnk--> arranged marriages is still common in the villages. Although uncommon, <!--del_lnk--> polygamy is accepted, often being a device to keep property in a contained family unit rather than dispersing it. The previous king, <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who abdicated in 2006, had four queens, all of whom are sisters. The current king, <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, wed <!--del_lnk--> Jetsun Pema, 21, a commoner and daughter of a pilot, on 13 October 2011.</p>

       <p>Bhutan's national sport is <!--del_lnk--> archery, and competitions are held regularly in most villages. It differs from <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a> standards in technical details such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere. There are two targets placed over 100 meters apart and teams shoot from one end of the field to the other. Each member of the team shoots two arrows per round. Traditional Bhutanese archery is a social event and competitions are organized between villages, towns, and amateur teams. There are usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing. Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter's ability. Darts (<i>khuru</i>) is an equally popular outdoor team sport, in which heavy wooden darts pointed with a 10&nbsp;cm nail are thrown at a paperback-sized target 10 to 20 meters away.</p>
       <p>Another traditional sport is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Digor</i>, which resembles the <!--del_lnk--> shot put and <!--del_lnk--> horseshoe throwing. <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">Cricket</a> has gained popularity in Bhutan, particularly since the introduction of television channels from India. The <!--del_lnk--> Bhutan national cricket team is one of the more successful affiliate nations in the region. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Association_football.htm" title="Association Football">Football</a> is also an increasingly popular sport. In 2002, Bhutan's national football team played <a href="../../wp/m/Montserrat.htm" title="Montserrat">Montserrat</a>, in what was billed as <!--del_lnk--> The Other Final; the match took place on the same day Brazil played Germany in the <!--del_lnk--> World Cup final, but at the time Bhutan and Montserrat were the world's two lowest ranked teams. The match was held in Thimphu's <!--del_lnk--> Changlimithang National Stadium, and Bhutan won 4&ndash;0. A documentary of the match was made by the Dutch filmmaker Johan Kramer.</p>
