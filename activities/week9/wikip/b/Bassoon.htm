       <p>The <b>bassoon</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> woodwind instrument in the <!--del_lnk--> double reed family that typically plays music written in the <!--del_lnk--> bass and <!--del_lnk--> tenor registers and occasionally even higher. Appearing in its modern form in the 1800s, the bassoon figures prominently in <a href="../../wp/o/Orchestra.htm" title="Orchestra">orchestral</a>, <!--del_lnk--> concert band, and <!--del_lnk--> chamber music literature. The instrument is known for its distinctive tone colour, wide range, variety of character, and agility. Its warm, dark, reedy <!--del_lnk--> timbre has often been compared to that of a male <!--del_lnk--> baritone voice. Due to the complicated <!--del_lnk--> fingering and the problem of <!--del_lnk--> reeds, the bassoon is an especially difficult instrument to learn; schoolchildren typically take up the bassoon only after starting on another woodwind instrument, such as the <a href="../../wp/f/Flute.htm" title="Flute">flute</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Clarinet.htm" title="Clarinet">clarinet</a>, or <a href="../../wp/s/Saxophone.htm" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a>.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> dulcian is generally considered to be the forerunner of the modern bassoon, as it shares many characteristics with the latter, including a double reed fitted to a metal crook, obliquely drilled <!--del_lnk--> tone holes, and a <!--del_lnk--> conical bore that doubles back upon itself. The origins of the dulcian are obscure, but by the mid 16th century it was available in as many as eight different sizes, from <!--del_lnk--> soprano to great bass. A full consort of dulcians was a rarity; its primary function seems to have been to provide the bass in the typical wind band of the time, either loud (<!--del_lnk--> shawms) or soft (<a href="../../wp/r/Recorder.htm" title="Recorder">recorders</a>), indicating a remarkable ability to vary <!--del_lnk--> dynamics to suit the need. Otherwise, dulcian technique was rather primitive, with eight fingerholes and generally one key, indicating that it could play in only a limited number of key signatures.</p>
       <p>About this time, the dulcian began to be known as <i>fagotto</i> in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>. However, the usual etymology that equates <i>fagotto</i> with "<!--del_lnk--> bundle of sticks" is somewhat misleading, as the latter term did not come into general use until somewhat later. A further discrepancy lies in the fact that the dulcian was usually carved out of a single block of wood, which is to say that it was a single "stick", and not a bundle.</p>
       <p>It is tempting to say that the dulcian merged imperceptibly into the bassoon, but in fact there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that the <!--del_lnk--> baroque bassoon was a newly-invented instrument, with only a superficial resemblance to the old dulcian. Note that the dulcian was never entirely supplanted--it continued to be used well into the 18th century by <a href="../../wp/j/Johann_Sebastian_Bach.htm" title="Johann Sebastian Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> and others. The man most likely responsible for the development of the true bassoon was Martin Hotteterre (d.1712), who may also have been the inventor of the three-piece <i>fl&ucirc;te traversi&egrave;re</i> and the <a href="../../wp/o/Oboe.htm#Baroque" title="Oboe"><i>hautbois</i></a>. Sometime in the 1650s, Hotteterre is believed to have conceived the bassoon in four sections (bell, bass joint, boot and wing joint), an arrangement which allowed far greater accuracy in machining the bore compared with the old dulcian. He also extended the compass downward to <!--del_lnk--> B&#x266D; with the addition of two <!--del_lnk--> keys An alternate view holds that Hotteterre was but one of several craftsmen responsible for the development of the early bassoon; these may have included additional members of the Hotteterre family, as well as other <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> makers active around the same time. No original French bassoon from this period survives, but if it did, it would most likely resemble the earliest extant bassoons of <!--del_lnk--> Johann Christoph Denner and Richard Haka from the 1680s. Sometime around 1700, a fourth key (<!--del_lnk--> G&#x266F;) was added, and it was for this type of instrument that composers such as <a href="../../wp/a/Antonio_Vivaldi.htm" title="Antonio Vivaldi">Antonio Vivaldi</a>, Bach, and <!--del_lnk--> Georg Philipp Telemann wrote their demanding music. A fifth key, for the low <!--del_lnk--> E&#x266D;, was added during the first half of the 18th century. Notable makers of the 4-key and 5-key baroque bassoon include J.H. Eichentopf (c.1678-1769), J. Poerschmann (1680-1757), <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Stanesby, Jr. (1668-1734), G.H. Scherer (1703-1778), and Prudent Thieriot (1732-1786).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_history">Modern history</span></h3>
       <p>Increasing demands on the capabilities of instruments and players in the 1800s &mdash; particularly concert halls requiring louder tones and the rise of virtuoso composer-performers &mdash; spurred on the further refinement of the bassoon. Increased sophistication both in manufacturing techniques and acoustical knowledge made possible great improvements in the playability of the instrument.</p>
       <p>The modern bassoon exists in two distinct primary forms, the Buffet system and the Heckel system. The Buffet system is played primarily in France but also in <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and parts of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, while the Heckel system is played in the majority of the world.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The design of the modern bassoon owes a great deal to the performer, teacher, and composer <!--del_lnk--> Carl Almenr&auml;der, who, assisted by the German acoustic researcher <!--del_lnk--> Gottfried Weber developed the 17-key bassoon whose range spanned four <!--del_lnk--> octaves. Almenr&auml;der's improvements to the bassoon began with an 1823 treatise in which he described ways of improving <!--del_lnk--> intonation, response, and technical ease of playing by means of augmenting and rearranging the keywork; subsequent articles further developed his ideas. Working at the Schott factory gave him the means to construct and test instruments according to these new designs, the results of which were published in <i>Caecilia</i>, Schott's house journal; Almenr&auml;der continued publishing and building instruments until his death in 1846, and <a href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_van_Beethoven.htm" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> himself requested one of the newly-made instruments after hearing of the papers. Almenr&auml;der left Schott to start his own factory along with partner <!--del_lnk--> Johann Adam Heckel in 1831.</p>
       <p>Heckel and two generations of descendants continued to refine the bassoon, and it is their instrument that has become the standard for other instrument makers to follow. Because of their superior singing tone quality (an improvement upon one of the main drawbacks of the Almenr&auml;der instruments), the Heckel instruments competed for prominence with the reformed Wiener system, a <!--del_lnk--> Boehm-style bassoon, and a completely-keyed instrument devised by <!--del_lnk--> Charles-Joseph Sax, father of <!--del_lnk--> Adolphe Sax. One latecomer attempt, from 1893, with a logical reformed fingering system was implemented by F.W. Kruspe, but failed to catch on. Other attempts at improving the instrument included a 24-keyed model and a single-reeded <!--del_lnk--> mouthpiece, but both were found to have adverse effects on the bassoon's distinctive tone and were abandoned.</p>
       <p>Coming into the 20th century the Heckel-style <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> model of bassoon dominated the field; Heckel himself had made over 1,100 instruments by the turn of the century (serial numbers begin at 3,000), and the <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> makers' instruments were no longer desirable for the changing <!--del_lnk--> pitch requirements of the symphony orchestra, remaining primarily in <!--del_lnk--> military band use.</p>
       <p>Except for a brief 1940s wartime conversion to <!--del_lnk--> ball bearing manufacture, the Heckel concern has produced instruments continuously to the present day. Heckel bassoons are considered by many the best, although a range of Heckel-style instruments is available from several other manufacturers, all with slightly different playing characteristics. Companies that manufacture Heckel-system bassoons include: <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Heckel, <!--del_lnk--> Yamaha, Fox Products, W. Schreiber &amp; S&ouml;hne, P&uuml;chner, <!--del_lnk--> The Selmer Company, Linton, Moosmann Kohlert, Moennig/Adler, B.H. Bell and <!--del_lnk--> Guntram Wolf. In addition, several factories in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> are producing inexpensive instruments under such labels as Laval, Haydn and Lark, and these have been available in the West for some time now. However, they are generally of marginal quality and are usually avoided by serious players.</p>
       <p>Because its mechanism is the most primitive of all the woodwinds, there have been occasional attempts at "reinventing" the bassoon. In the 1960s the Englishman Giles Brindley began development of what he called the "logical" bassoon, which aimed to improve intonation and evenness of tone through use of an electrically activated mechanism, making possible key combinations that were too complex for the human hand to manage. However, Brindley's "logical bassoon" was never marketed.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Buffet_.28French.29_system">Buffet (French) system</span></h4>
       <p>The Buffet system bassoon achieved its basic acoustical properties somewhat earlier than the Heckel; thereafter it continued to develop in a more conservative manner. While the early history of the Heckel bassoon included a complete overhaul of the instrument in both <!--del_lnk--> acoustics and keywork, the development of the Buffet system consisted primarily of incremental improvements to the keywork. This minimalist approach deprived the Buffet of the improved consistency, and thus the ease of operation and increased power found in the Heckel bassoons, but the Buffet is considered by some to have a more vocal and expressive quality. For example, the conductor <!--del_lnk--> John Foulds lamented in 1934 the dominance of the Heckel-style bassoon, considering them to be too homogeneous in sound with the <a href="../../wp/h/Horn_%2528instrument%2529.htm" title="Horn (instrument)">horn</a>.</p>
       <p>Compared to the Heckel bassoon, Buffet system bassoons have a narrower bore and somewhat simplified mechanism, requiring different fingerings for many notes. It is not possible to switch from the Heckel to the Buffet, and vice versa, without extensive "retraining". Buffet instruments are known for a reedier sound and greater facility in the <!--del_lnk--> upper registers, reaching e''' and f''' with far greater ease and less air pressure. French woodwind tone in general exhibits a certain amount of "edge", with more of a vocal quality than is usual elsewhere, and the Buffet bassoon is no exception. This type of sound can be beneficial in music by French composers, but it also has drawn criticism for being too intrusive. As with all bassoons, the tone varies considerably depending on the individual instrument and performer. In the hands of a lesser player, the Heckel bassoon can sound rather flat and woody, but good players succeed in producing a vibrant, singing tone. Conversely, when poorly played the Buffet can sound buzzy and nasal, but good players succeed in producing a warm, expressive sound different from but in no way inferior to that of the Heckel.</p>
       <p>Though the French system was once widely favored in England, Buffet-system instruments are no longer made there, and the last prominent English player of the French system retired in the 1980s. However, with its continued use in some regions and its distinctive tone, the Buffet continues to have a place in modern bassoon playing, particularly in France. Buffet-model bassoons are currently made in Paris by <!--del_lnk--> Buffet Crampon and The Selmer Company. Some players, for example Gerald Corey in <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, have learned to play both types and will alternate between them depending on the repertoire being played.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Usage_in_ensembles">Usage in ensembles</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Earlier_ensembles">Earlier ensembles</span></h3>
       <p>The bassoon was first used in the orchestra to reinforce the bass line, and to act as the bass of the double reed choir (<a href="../../wp/o/Oboe.htm" title="Oboe">oboes</a> and taille). Baroque composer <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste Lully and his <i>Les Petits Violons</i> included oboes and bassoons along with the strings in the 16-piece (later 21-piece) ensemble, as one of the first orchestras to include the newly-invented double reeds. <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Cesti included a bassoon in his 1668 opera <i>Il Pomo d'oro</i> (The Golden Apple). However, the use of the bassoon in the concert orchestra was sporadic until the late 17th century when double reeds began to make their way into the standard instrumentation, largely due to the spread of the <i>hautbois</i> to countries outside of France. Increasing use of the bassoon as a <i><!--del_lnk--> basso continuo</i> instrument meant that it began to be included in <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a> orchestras, first in France and later in Italy, Germany and England. Meanwhile, composers such as <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Bodin de Boismortier, <!--del_lnk--> Michel Corrette, <!--del_lnk--> Johann Ernst Galliard, <!--del_lnk--> Jan Dismas Zelenka, <!--del_lnk--> Johann Friedrich Fasch and Telemann wrote demanding solo and ensemble music for the instrument. Antonio Vivaldi brought the bassoon to prominence by featuring it in 37 <!--del_lnk--> concerti for the instrument.</p>
       <p>By mid-century, the bassoon's function in the orchestra was still mostly limited to that of a continuo instrument--since scores often made no specific mention of the bassoon, its use was implied, particularly if there were parts for oboes or other winds. Beginning in the early <a href="../../wp/r/Rococo.htm" title="Rococo">Rococo</a> era, composers such as <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Haydn.htm" title="Joseph Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Johann Christian Bach, <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Battista Sammartini and <!--del_lnk--> Johann Stamitz included parts that exploited the bassoon for its unique colour, rather than for its perfunctory ability to double the bass line. Orchestral works with fully-independent parts for the bassoon would not become commonplace until the <!--del_lnk--> Classical era. <a href="../../wp/w/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart.htm" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>'s "<!--del_lnk--> Jupiter" symphony is a prime example, with its famous bassoon solos in the first <!--del_lnk--> movement. The bassoons were generally paired, as in current practice, though the famed <!--del_lnk--> Mannheim Orchestra boasted four.</p>
       <p>Another important use of the bassoon during the Classical era was in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Harmonie</i>, a chamber ensemble consisting of pairs of oboes, horns and bassoons; later, two clarinets would be added to form an octet. The <i>Harmonie</i> was an ensemble maintained by German and <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austrian</a> noblemen for private music-making, and was a cost-effective alternative to a full orchestra. Haydn, Mozart, <a href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_van_Beethoven.htm" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Franz Krommer all wrote considerable amounts of music for the <i>Harmonie</i>.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_ensembles">Modern ensembles</span></h3>
       <p>The modern symphony orchestra typically calls for two bassoons, often with a third playing the <!--del_lnk--> contrabassoon. Some works call for four or more players. The first player is frequently called upon to perform solo passages. The bassoon's distinctive tone suits it for both plaintive, lyrical solos such as <!--del_lnk--> Maurice Ravel's <i><!--del_lnk--> Bol&eacute;ro</i> and more comical ones, such as the grandfather's theme in <i><a href="../../wp/p/Peter_and_the_Wolf.htm" title="Peter and the Wolf">Peter and the Wolf</a></i>. Its agility suits it for passages such as the famous running line (doubled in the <a href="../../wp/v/Viola.htm" title="Viola">violas</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cello.htm" title="Cello">cellos</a>) in the overture to <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Marriage_of_Figaro.htm" title="The Marriage of Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a></i>. In addition to its solo role, the bassoon is an effective bass to a woodwind choir, a bass line along with the cellos and <a href="../../wp/d/Double_bass.htm" title="Double bass">double basses</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> harmonic support along with the French horns.</p>
       <p>A wind ensemble will usually also include two bassoons and sometimes contra, each with independent parts; other types of concert wind ensembles will often have larger sections, with many players on each of first or second parts; in simpler arrangements there will be only one bassoon part and no contra. The bassoon's role in the wind band is similar to its role in the orchestra, though when scoring is thick it often cannot be heard above the brass instruments also in its range. <i>La Fiesta Mexicana</i>, by <!--del_lnk--> H. Owen Reed, features the instrument prominently, as does the transcription of <!--del_lnk--> Malcolm Arnold's <i>Four Scottish Dances</i> which has become a staple of the concert band repertoire.</p>
       <p>The bassoon is also part of the standard <!--del_lnk--> wind quintet instrumentation, along with the flute, oboe, clarinet, and horn; it is also frequently combined in various ways with other woodwinds. <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Strauss.htm" title="Richard Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>'s "Duet-Concertino" pairs it with the clarinet as <i>concertante</i> instruments, with string orchestra in support.</p>
       <p>The bassoon quartet has also gained favour in recent times. The bassoon's wide range and variety of tone colors make it ideally suited to grouping in like-instrument ensembles. <!--del_lnk--> Peter Schickele's "Last Tango in Bayreuth" (after themes from <i><!--del_lnk--> Tristan and Iseult</i>) is a popular work; Schickele's fictional alter ego <!--del_lnk--> P. D. Q. Bach exploits the more humorous aspects with his quartet "Lip My Reeds", which at one point calls for players to perform on the reed alone. It also calls for a low <!--del_lnk--> A at the very end of the prelude section in the fourth bassoon part. It is written so that the first bassoon does not play; instead, his or her role is to place an extension in the bell of the fourth bassoon so that the note can be played.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Jazz">Jazz</span></h3>
       <p>The bassoon is infrequently used as a <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a> instrument and rarely seen in a <!--del_lnk--> jazz ensemble. It first began appearing in the 1920s, including specific calls for its use in <!--del_lnk--> Paul Whiteman's group and a few other session appearances. The next few decades saw the instrument used only sporadically, as symphonic jazz fell out of favour, but the 1960s saw artists such as <!--del_lnk--> Yusef Lateef and <!--del_lnk--> Chick Corea incorporate bassoon into their recordings; Lateef's diverse and eclectic instrumentation saw the bassoon as a natural addition, while Corea employed the bassoon in combination with <!--del_lnk--> flautist <!--del_lnk--> Hubert Laws.</p>
       <p>More recently, <!--del_lnk--> Illinois Jacquet and <!--del_lnk--> Frank Tiberi have both doubled on bassoon in addition to their usual saxophone performances. Bassoonist <!--del_lnk--> Karen Borca, a performer of <!--del_lnk--> free jazz, is one of the few jazz musicians to play only bassoon; <!--del_lnk--> Michael Rabinowitz, the <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> bassoonist <!--del_lnk--> Javier Abad, and <!--del_lnk--> James Lassen, an <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> resident in <!--del_lnk--> Bergen, <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>, are others. <!--del_lnk--> Lindsay Cooper, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Hanson, the <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> bassoonist <!--del_lnk--> Alexandre Silverio, and <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Smith are also currently using the bassoon in jazz. French bassoonists <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Jacques Decreux and <!--del_lnk--> Alexandre Ouzounoff have both recorded jazz, exploiting the flexibility of the Buffet system instrument to good effect.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Popular_music">Popular music</span></h3>
       <p>The bassoon is even rarer as a regular member of rock bands. However, several 1960s pop music hits feature the bassoon, including <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tears of a Clown</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, <i><!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Juniper</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Donovan, <i><!--del_lnk--> 59th Street Bridge Song</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and the oompah bassoon underlying <!--del_lnk--> The New Vaudeville Band's <i><!--del_lnk--> Winchester Cathedral</i>. From 1968 to 1978, the bassoon was played by Lindsay Cooper in the English <!--del_lnk--> avant-garde band <!--del_lnk--> Henry Cow, and in the 1970s it was used by the English band <!--del_lnk--> Gryphon (played by Brian Gulland).</p>
       <p>In the 1990s, <!--del_lnk--> Madonna Wayne Gacy provided bassoon for the alternative metal band <!--del_lnk--> Marilyn Manson as did Aimee DeFoe, in what is self-described as "grouchily lilting garage bassoon", in the indie-rock band <!--del_lnk--> Blogurt from <!--del_lnk--> Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Icelandic pop band Hjaltal&iacute;n also contains a bassoon player called Rebekka . The rock band <!--del_lnk--> Better Than Ezra took their name from a passage in <a href="../../wp/e/Ernest_Hemingway.htm" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>'s <i><!--del_lnk--> A Moveable Feast</i> in which the author comments that listening to an annoyingly talkative person is still &ldquo;better than Ezra learning how to play the bassoon,&rdquo; referring to <a href="../../wp/e/Ezra_Pound.htm" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a>.</p>
       <p>Bassoons also frequently provide background music for advertisements and cartoons. They give a great sense of a light and happy environment. Although, they could also give a much darker and creepier tone. Indeed, the bassoon could be used for a wide variety of tone settings. The bassoon is one of the most unique instruments and is known distinctly for its wide range (which is what allows it to produce such different moods).</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Technique">Technique</span></h2>
       <div class="floatright"><a class="image" href="../../images/541/54148.jpg.htm"><img alt="Bassoon2 (PSF).jpg" height="392" src="../../images/541/54148.jpg"  width="300" /></a></div>
       <p>The bassoon is held diagonally in front of the player and cannot easily be supported by the player's hands alone. The most common means of support are 1) a neck-strap or shoulder-harness attached to the top of the boot joint, or 2) a seat strap attached to the base of the boot joint which is laid across the chair seat prior to sitting down. Occasionally a spike similar to those used for the cello or the bass clarinet is attached to the bottom of the boot joint and rests on the floor. It is possible to play while standing up if the player uses a neck strap or similar harness, or if the seat strap is tied to the belt. Sometimes a device called a <i>balance hanger</i> is used when playing in a standing position. This is installed between the instrument and the neck strap, and shifts the centre of gravity to a higher, more favorable position.</p>
       <p>The Heckel-system bassoon is played with both hands in a stationary position, the left above the right, with five main finger holes on the front of the instrument (nearest the audience) plus a sixth that is activated by an open-standing key. Five additional keys on the front are controlled by the little fingers of each hand. The back of the instrument (nearest the player) has twelve or more keys to be controlled by the thumbs, the exact number varying depending on model.</p>
       <p>To stabilize the right hand, many bassoonists use an adjustable comma-shaped apparatus called a "crutch" which mounts to the boot joint; players use a thumb screw to secure the crutch and vary the distance that it protrudes from the bassoon. Players rest the curve of the right hand where the thumb joins the palm against the crutch. The crutch also keeps the right hand from tiring and enables the player to keep put the finger pads flat on the finger holes and keys.</p>
       <p>An aspect of bassoon technique not found on any other woodwind is called <i>flicking</i>. It involves the momentary pressing, or "flicking", of the high A, <!--del_lnk--> C and <!--del_lnk--> D keys by the left hand thumb at the beginning of certain notes in the middle octave in order to eliminate the "cracking" or brief microphonic that happens without the use of the key. "Flicking" is not universal amongst bassoonists; some American players, principally on the <!--del_lnk--> East Coast, use it sparingly, if at all. The rest use it virtually 100% of the time--it has become in essence "part of the fingering".</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> players in general are "flickers". Some hold down the appropriate key for the duration of the note, rather than just at the beginning; this is sometimes referred to as "venting".</p>
       <p>A "no-flick" octave key system is available as an add-on, invented by <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Weisberg. Only a few years old, it has yet to be offered as "standard equipment" by any of the major bassoon manufacturers.</p>
       <p>While bassoons are usually critically tuned at the factory, the player nonetheless has a great degree of flexibility of pitch control through the use of breath support and <!--del_lnk--> embouchure. Players can also use alternate fingerings to adjust the pitch of many notes.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Extended_techniques">Extended techniques</span></h3>
       <p>Many extended techniques can be performed on the bassoon, such as <!--del_lnk--> multiphonics, <!--del_lnk--> fluttertonguing, <!--del_lnk--> circular breathing, <!--del_lnk--> double tonguing, and harmonics.</p>
       <p>Also, using certain fingerings, notes may be produced on the instrument that sound lower pitches than the actual range of the instrument. These "impossible notes" tend to sound very gravelly and out of tune, but technically sound below the low B&#x266D;. Alternatively, lower notes can be produced by inserting a small paper or rubber tube into the end of the bell, which converts the lower B&#x266D; into a lower note such as an A natural; this does not affect the tuning of other notes in the lower register.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Bassoon reeds, made of <i><!--del_lnk--> Arundo donax</i> cane, are often made by the players themselves, although beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces. The cane is then trimmed and <i>gouged</i> to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or <i>profile</i>, by removing material from the bark side. This can be done by hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this insures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel <!--del_lnk--> mandrel (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the "throat", and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.</p>
       <p>After the reed has dried, the wires are tightened around the reed, which has shrunk after drying. The lower part is sealed (generally with a <!--del_lnk--> nitrocellulose-based cement such as Duco) and then wrapped with string to ensure both that no air leaks out through the bottom of the reed and that the reed maintains its shape. The bulge in the string wrapping is often referred to as the "turban"--it serves as a convenient handle when inserting the reed on the bocal.</p>
       <p>To finish the reed, the end of the reed blank, originally at the centre of the unfolded piece of cane, is cut off, creating an opening. The blades above the first wire are now roughly 27&ndash;30&nbsp;mm (1.1&ndash;1.2&nbsp;in) long. In order for the reed to play, a slight bevel must be created at the tip with a knife, although there is also a machine that can perform this function. Other adjustments with the knife may be necessary, depending on the hardness and profile of the cane and the requirements of the player. The reed opening may also need to be adjusted by squeezing either the first or second wire with the pliers. Additional material may be removed from the sides (the "channels") or tip to balance the reed. Additionally, if the "e" in the staff is sagging in pitch, it may be necessary to "clip" the reed by removing 1&ndash;2&nbsp;mm (0.039&ndash;0.079&nbsp;in) from its length.</p>
       <p>Playing styles of individual bassoonists vary greatly; because of this, most advanced players will make their own reeds, in the process customizing them to their individual playing requirements. Many companies and individuals do offer reeds for sale, but even with store-bought reeds, the player must know how to make adjustments to suit his particular playing style.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_reeds">Early reeds</span></h3>
       <p>Little is known about the early construction of the bassoon reed, as few examples survive, and much of what is known is only what can be gathered from artistic representations. The earliest known written instructions date from the middle of the 17th century, describing the reed as being held together by wire or resined thread; the earliest actual reeds that survive are more than a century younger, a collection of 21 reeds from the late 18th century Spanish <i>bajon</i>.</p>
