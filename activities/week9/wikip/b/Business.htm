       <p>A <b>business</b> (also known as <b>enterprise</b> or <b>firm</b>) is an <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Organization.htm" title="Organisation">organisation</a> involved in the <a href="../../wp/t/Trade.htm" title="Trade">trade</a> of <!--del_lnk--> goods, <a href="../../wp/s/Service_%2528economics%2529.htm" title="Service (economics)">services</a>, or both to <!--del_lnk--> consumers. <!--del_lnk--> Business plan and <!--del_lnk--> Business model determine the outcome of an active business operation. Businesses are predominant in <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> <!--del_lnk--> economies, where most of them are <!--del_lnk--> privately owned and administered to provide service to its <!--del_lnk--> customers. Businesses may also be <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nonprofit_organization.htm" title="Non-profit organization">not-for-profit</a> or <!--del_lnk--> state-owned. A business owned by multiple individuals may be referred to as a <!--del_lnk--> company, although that term also has a more precise meaning.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> etymology of "business" relates to the state of being busy either as an individual or society, as a whole, doing commercially viable and profitable work. The term "business" has at least three usages, depending on the scope&nbsp;&mdash; the singular usage to mean a particular organization; the generalized usage to refer to a particular <!--del_lnk--> market sector, "the music business" and compound forms such as <!--del_lnk--> agribusiness; and the broadest meaning, which encompasses all activity by the community of suppliers of goods and services. However, the exact definition of business, like much else in the <!--del_lnk--> philosophy of business, is a matter of debate and complexity of meanings.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_forms_of_ownership">Basic forms of ownership</span> </h2>
       <p>Although forms of business ownership vary by <!--del_lnk--> jurisdiction, several common forms exist:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Sole proprietorship:</b> A <!--del_lnk--> sole proprietorship is a business owned by one person for-profit. The owner may operate the business alone or may employ others. The owner of the business has unlimited <!--del_lnk--> liability for the debts incurred by the business.</li>
        <li><b>Partnership:</b> A <a href="../../wp/p/Partnership.htm" title="Partnership">partnership</a> is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three typical classifications of for-profit partnerships are <!--del_lnk--> general partnerships, <!--del_lnk--> limited partnerships, and <!--del_lnk--> limited liability partnerships.</li>
        <li><b>Corporation:</b> A <a href="../../wp/c/Corporation.htm" title="Corporation">corporation</a> is a <!--del_lnk--> limited liability business that has a separate <!--del_lnk--> legal personality from its members. Corporations can be either <!--del_lnk--> government-owned or privately owned, and corporations can organize either for-profit or <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nonprofit_organization.htm" title="Non-profit organization">not-for-profit</a>. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by <!--del_lnk--> shareholders who elect a <!--del_lnk--> board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either <!--del_lnk--> privately held or <!--del_lnk--> publicly held.</li>
        <li><b>Cooperative:</b> Often referred to as a "co-op", a <a href="../../wp/c/Cooperative.htm" title="Cooperative">cooperative</a> is a limited liability business that can organize for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a for-profit corporation in that it has members, as opposed to shareholders, who share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either <!--del_lnk--> consumer cooperatives or <!--del_lnk--> worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of <!--del_lnk--> economic democracy.</li>
       </ul>

        <li>Information businesses generate profits primarily from the resale of <!--del_lnk--> intellectual property and include <!--del_lnk--> movie studios, publishers and packaged <!--del_lnk--> software companies.</li>
        <li><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturer">Manufacturers</a> produce <!--del_lnk--> products, from <!--del_lnk--> raw materials or component parts, which they then sell at a profit. Companies that make physical <!--del_lnk--> goods, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Cars">cars</a> or pipes, are considered manufacturers.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Real estate businesses generate profit from the selling, renting, and development of properties comprising land, residential <!--del_lnk--> homes, and other kinds of buildings.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Retailers and <!--del_lnk--> distributors act as middle-men in getting goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumer, generating a profit as a result of providing sales or distribution services. Most consumer-oriented stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Service businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically generate a profit by charging for labor or other services provided to <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a>, other businesses, or <!--del_lnk--> consumers. Organizations ranging from house decorators to consulting firms, <!--del_lnk--> restaurants, and even entertainers are types of service businesses.</li>
        <li><a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">Transportation</a> businesses deliver goods and individuals from location to location, generating a profit on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transportation">transportation</a> costs.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Utilities produce public services such as electricity or sewage treatment, usually under a government <!--del_lnk--> charter.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>There are many other divisions and subdivisions of businesses. The authoritative list of business types for North America is generally considered to be the <!--del_lnk--> North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS. The equivalent European Union list is the <!--del_lnk--> Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE).Mill,</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Management">Management</span> </h2>
       <p>The efficient and effective <!--del_lnk--> operation of a business, and study of this subject, is called <!--del_lnk--> management. The major branches of management are <a href="../../wp/f/Finance.htm" title="Finance">financial management</a>, <!--del_lnk--> marketing management, <!--del_lnk--> human resource management, <!--del_lnk--> strategic management, <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">production management</a>, <!--del_lnk--> operations management, service management and <!--del_lnk--> information technology management.</p>
       <p>Owners engage in business administration either directly or indirectly through the employment of managers. Owner managers, or hired managers administer to three component resources that constitute the business' value or worth: financial resources, capital or tangible resources, and human resources. These resources are administered to in at least five functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resourcing.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reforming_state_enterprises">Reforming state enterprises</span> </h3>
       <p>In recent decades, assets and enterprises that were run by various states have been modeled after business enterprises. In 2003, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> reformed 80% of its <!--del_lnk--> state-owned enterprises and modeled them on a company-type management system. Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have been transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.</p>
       <p>Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach[1] focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. It promotes business effectiveness and efficiency while striving for innovation, flexibility, and integration with technology. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can therefore be described as a "process optimization process." It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, more effective and more capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organization_and_government_regulation">Organization and government regulation</span> </h2>
       <p>Most legal <!--del_lnk--> jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of <!--del_lnk--> commercial law for each type.</p>
       <p>The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:</p>
       <div class="thumb tright">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:252px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/342/34202.jpg.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="187" src="../../images/342/34202.jpg"  width="250" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

        </div>
       </div>
       <ul>
        <li><b>The size and scope of the business firm</b> and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the <!--del_lnk--> theory of the firm. Generally a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a <a href="../../wp/s/Stock_market.htm" title="Stock market">stock market</a> or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.</li>
        <li><b>The sector and country.</b> Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Limited Liability Companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from <!--del_lnk--> business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not so protected.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Tax advantages.</b> Different structures are treated differently in tax law, and may have advantages for this reason.</li>
        <li><b>Disclosure and compliance requirements</b>. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities), and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of <!--del_lnk--> shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from <!--del_lnk--> personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate "person". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.</p>
       <p>Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located.</p>
       <p>A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a <i>sole proprietor</i>, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity.</p>
       <p>A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.</li>
        <li>Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like "real" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called <!--del_lnk--> double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.</li>
        <li>In most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently than large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.</li>
        <li>To "go public" (sometimes called <!--del_lnk--> IPO) -- which basically means to allow a part of the business to be owned by a wider range of investors or the public in general&mdash;you must organize a separate entity, which is usually required to comply with a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLCs that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well (for example, <!--del_lnk--> real estate investment trusts in the USA, <!--del_lnk--> unit trusts in the UK). However, you cannot take a general partnership "public."</li>

       <p>Most commercial transactions are governed by a very detailed and well-established body of rules that have evolved over a very long period of time, it being the case that governing trade and commerce was a strong driving force in the creation of law and courts in <!--del_lnk--> Western civilization.</p>
       <p>As for other laws that regulate or affect businesses, in many countries it is all but impossible to chronicle them all in a single reference source. There are laws governing treatment of labour and generally relations with employees, safety and protection issues (<!--del_lnk--> Health and Safety), anti-discrimination laws (age, gender, disabilities, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation), minimum wage laws, <a href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade union">union</a> laws, workers compensation laws, and annual vacation or working hours time.</p>
       <p>In some specialized businesses, there may also be licenses required, either due to special laws that govern entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, which may require special education, or by local governments. Professions that require special licenses range from law and medicine to flying airplanes to selling liquor to radio broadcasting to selling investment securities to selling used cars to roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business without regard to the type of business involved.</p>
       <p>Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation. These industries include, for example, <!--del_lnk--> public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, <a href="../../wp/b/Broadcasting.htm" title="Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>, <!--del_lnk--> aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many kinds of businesses in unexpected ways.</p>

       </div>
       <p>When businesses need to raise money (called <a href="../../wp/c/Capital_%2528economics%2529.htm" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a>), they sometimes offer <!--del_lnk--> securities for sale.</p>
       <p>Capital may be raised through private means, by public offer (<!--del_lnk--> Initial Public Offering - IPO) on a <!--del_lnk--> stock exchange, or in many other ways. Major stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, <!--del_lnk--> New York Stock Exchange and <!--del_lnk--> Nasdaq (USA), the <a href="../../wp/l/London_Stock_Exchange.htm" title="London Stock Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> (UK), the <!--del_lnk--> Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), <!--del_lnk--> Bombay Stock Exchange(India) and so on. Most countries with capital markets have at least one.</p>
       <p>Businesses that have gone "public" are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance (such as how executive officers' compensation is determined) and when and how information is disclosed to the public and their shareholders. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other Western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC), in China. In Singapore, the regulation authority is Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).</p>
       <p>As noted at the beginning, it is impossible to enumerate all of the types of laws and regulations that affect business today. In fact, these laws have become so numerous and complex, that no business lawyer can learn them all, forcing increasing specialization among corporate attorneys. It is not unheard of for teams of 5 to 10 attorneys to be required to handle certain kinds of corporate transactions, due to the sprawling nature of modern regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, M&amp;A law (who specialize in acquisitions), tax law, ERISA law (ERISA in the United States governs employee benefit plans), food and drug regulatory law, intellectual property law (specializing in copyrights, patents, trademarks and such), telecommunications law, and more.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intellectual_property">Intellectual property</span> </h3>
       <p>Businesses often have important "<!--del_lnk--> intellectual property" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international <!--del_lnk--> treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign non-compete clauses which will impose limitations on an employees interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.</p>
