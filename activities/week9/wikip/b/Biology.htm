       <p>The term <i><!--del_lnk--> biology</i> is derived from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek Language">Greek</a> word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><!--del_lnk--> &beta;&#x3AF;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>bios</i>, "<a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a>" and the suffix <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><!--del_lnk--> -&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&#x3AF;&alpha;</span>, <i>-logia</i>, "study of." The Latin form of the term first appeared in 1736 when Linnaeus (Carl von Linn&eacute;) used <i>biologi</i> in his <i>Bibliotheca botanica</i>. It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled <i>Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae: tomus III, continens geologian, biologian, phytologian generalis</i>, by Michael Christoph Hanov, a disciple of Christian Wolff. The first German use, <i>Biologie</i>, was used in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus' work. In 1797, Theodor Georg Roose used the term in a book, <i>Grundz&uuml;ge der Lehre van der Lebenskraft</i>, in the preface. Karl Friedrich Burdach used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological, physiological and psychological perspective (<i>Prop&auml;deutik zum Studien der gesammten Heilkunst</i>). The term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise <i>Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur</i> (1802&ndash;22) by Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus, who announced:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life, the conditions and laws under which these phenomena occur, and the causes through which they have been effected. The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology [Biologie] or the doctrine of life [Lebenslehre]. (1:4)</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>Although biology in its modern form is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. <!--del_lnk--> Natural philosophy was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent, and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>. While the formal study of <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a> dates back to <a href="../../wp/h/Hippocrates.htm" title="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> (ca. 460 BC &ndash; ca. 370 BC), it was <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (384 BC &ndash; 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his <!--del_lnk--> History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the <!--del_lnk--> Lyceum, <!--del_lnk--> Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on <a href="../../wp/b/Botany.htm" title="Botany">botany</a> that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.</p>
       <p>Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included <!--del_lnk--> al-Jahiz (781&ndash;869), <!--del_lnk--> Al-Dinawari (828&ndash;896), who wrote on botany, and <!--del_lnk--> Rhazes (865&ndash;925) who wrote on <a href="../../wp/a/Anatomy.htm" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a> and <!--del_lnk--> physiology. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.</p>
       <p>Biology began to quickly develop and grow with <!--del_lnk--> Antony van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvement of the <a href="../../wp/m/Microscope.htm" title="Microscope">microscope</a>. It was then that scholars discovered <!--del_lnk--> spermatozoa, <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> infusoria and the sheer strangeness and diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by <!--del_lnk--> Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in <!--del_lnk--> entomology and built the basic techniques of microscopic <!--del_lnk--> dissection and <!--del_lnk--> staining.</p>
       <p>Advances in <!--del_lnk--> microscopy also had a profound impact on biological thinking itself. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cell_%2528biology%2529.htm" title="Cell (biology)">cell</a>. In 1838 and 1839, <!--del_lnk--> Schleiden and <!--del_lnk--> Schwann began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a>, although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of <!--del_lnk--> Robert Remak and <!--del_lnk--> Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as <!--del_lnk--> cell theory.</p>
       <p>Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became a focus in the study of natural history. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Carl_Linnaeus.htm" title="Carolus Linnaeus">Carolus Linnaeus</a> published a basic <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced <a href="../../wp/b/Binomial_nomenclature.htm" title="Binomial nomenclature">scientific names</a> for all his species. <!--del_lnk--> Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable&mdash;even suggesting the possibility of <!--del_lnk--> common descent. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the <!--del_lnk--> history of evolutionary thought; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both <!--del_lnk--> Lamarck and <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin</a>.</p>
       <p>Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. However, it was the British naturalist <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Robert_Malthus.htm" title="Thomas Malthus">Thomas Malthus's</a> writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, that created a more successful evolutionary theory based on <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>; similar reasoning and evidence led <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.</p>
       <p>The discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and <!--del_lnk--> population genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> as the component of <!--del_lnk--> chromosomes that held genes. A focus on new model organisms such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/v/Virus.htm" title="Viruses">viruses</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>, along with the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of <!--del_lnk--> molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The <a href="../../wp/g/Genetic_code.htm" title="Genetic code">genetic code</a> was cracked by <!--del_lnk--> Har Gobind Khorana, <!--del_lnk--> Robert W. Holley and <!--del_lnk--> Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Genetic_code.htm" title="Codons">codons</a>. Finally, the <!--del_lnk--> Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human <!--del_lnk--> genome. This project was essentially completed in 2003, with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cell_theory">Cell theory</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Cell theory states that the <!--del_lnk--> cell is the fundamental unit of <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a>, and that all living things are composed of one or more cells or the <!--del_lnk--> secreted products of those cells (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> shells). All cells arise from other cells through <!--del_lnk--> cell division. In <!--del_lnk--> multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized <!--del_lnk--> egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. Additionally, the phenomenon of <!--del_lnk--> energy flow occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as <!--del_lnk--> metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (<a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a>) which is passed from cell to cell during cell division.</p>

       <p>A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, and that all life-forms known have a <!--del_lnk--> common origin. Introduced into the scientific lexicon by <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck in 1809, evolution was established by <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> fifty years later as a viable scientific model when he articulated its driving force: <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>. (<!--del_lnk--> Alfred Russel Wallace is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution.) Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on Earth.</p>
       <p>Darwin theorized that species and breeds developed through the processes of <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> and <!--del_lnk--> artificial selection or <!--del_lnk--> selective breeding. <!--del_lnk--> Genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the <!--del_lnk--> modern synthesis of the theory.</p>
       <p>The evolutionary history of the <a href="../../wp/s/Species.htm" title="Species">species</a>&mdash;which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended&mdash;together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its <!--del_lnk--> phylogeny. Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny. These include the comparisons of <!--del_lnk--> DNA sequences conducted within <!--del_lnk--> molecular biology or <!--del_lnk--> genomics, and comparisons of <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a> or other records of ancient organisms in <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">paleontology</a>. Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods, including <!--del_lnk--> phylogenetics, <!--del_lnk--> phenetics, and <!--del_lnk--> cladistics. (For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists, see <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary timeline.)</p>
       <div style="clear:right;">
       </div>
       <p>The theory of evolution postulates that all <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a> on the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral <!--del_lnk--> gene pool. This last universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about <!--del_lnk--> 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists generally regard the universality and ubiquity of the <a href="../../wp/g/Genetic_code.htm" title="Genetic code">genetic code</a> as definitive evidence in favour of the theory of universal common descent for all <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">bacteria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> archaea, and <a href="../../wp/e/Eukaryote.htm" title="Eukaryote">eukaryotes</a> (see: <!--del_lnk--> origin of life).</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Genetics">Genetics</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Genes are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms. A <!--del_lnk--> gene is a unit of <!--del_lnk--> heredity and corresponds to a region of <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">proteins</a>. Cells <!--del_lnk--> transcribe a DNA gene into an <!--del_lnk--> RNA version of the gene, and a <!--del_lnk--> ribosome then <!--del_lnk--> translates the RNA into a protein, a sequence of <a href="../../wp/a/Amino_acid.htm" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>. The <a href="../../wp/g/Genetic_code.htm" title="Genetic code">translation code</a> from RNA codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms, but slightly different for some. For example, a sequence of DNA that codes for <a href="../../wp/i/Insulin.htm" title="Insulin">insulin</a> in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.</p>
       <p>DNA usually occurs as linear <!--del_lnk--> chromosomes in <a href="../../wp/e/Eukaryote.htm" title="Eukaryote">eukaryotes</a>, and circular chromosomes in <!--del_lnk--> prokaryotes. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> and <!--del_lnk--> histones. The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mitochondrion.htm" title="Mitochondria">mitochondria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as its <!--del_lnk--> genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is located in the <!--del_lnk--> cell nucleus, along with small amounts in <a href="../../wp/m/Mitochondrion.htm" title="Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a> and <!--del_lnk--> chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the <!--del_lnk--> nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its <!--del_lnk--> genotype.</p>

The GCs then reduce the rate of secretion by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland once a sufficient amount of GCs has been released.</div>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Homeostasis is the ability of an <!--del_lnk--> open system to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple <!--del_lnk--> dynamic equilibrium adjustments controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a>, whether <!--del_lnk--> unicellular or <!--del_lnk--> multicellular, exhibit homeostasis.</p>
       <p>To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally respond through <!--del_lnk--> negative feedback. This means stabilizing conditions by either reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of <!--del_lnk--> glucagon when sugar levels are too low.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy">Energy</span></h3>
       <p>The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a>. Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm#Energy" title="Chemistry">energy</a> from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, <a href="../../wp/m/Molecule.htm" title="Molecule">molecules</a> of <!--del_lnk--> chemical substances that constitute <a href="../../wp/f/Food.htm" title="Food">food</a> play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed for biological <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_reaction.htm" title="Chemical reaction">chemical reactions</a>; second, they develop new molecular structures made up of biomolecules.</p>
       <p>The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or <!--del_lnk--> autotrophs. Nearly all of these organisms originally draw energy from the sun. Plants and other <!--del_lnk--> phototrophs use solar energy via a process known as <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as <a href="../../wp/a/Adenosine_triphosphate.htm" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a>, whose bonds can be broken to release energy. A few <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems, however, depend entirely on energy extracted by <!--del_lnk--> chemotrophs from <a href="../../wp/m/Methane.htm" title="Methane">methane</a>, <!--del_lnk--> sulfides, or other non-<a href="../../wp/s/Solar_energy.htm" title="Solar energy">luminal</a> energy sources.</p>
       <p>Some of the captured energy is used to produce <!--del_lnk--> biomass to sustain <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a> and provide energy for growth and development. The majority of the rest of this energy is lost as heat and waste molecules. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are <!--del_lnk--> metabolism and <!--del_lnk--> cellular respiration.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Molecular biology is the study of biology at a molecular level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly with <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetics</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Biochemistry.htm" title="Biochemistry">biochemistry</a>. Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interrelationship of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Cell biology studies the structural and <!--del_lnk--> physiological properties of <a href="../../wp/c/Cell_%2528biology%2529.htm" title="Cell (biology)">cells</a>, including their <!--del_lnk--> behaviors, interactions, and <!--del_lnk--> environment. This is done on both the <a href="../../wp/m/Microscope.htm" title="Microscope">microscopic</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Molecule.htm" title="Molecule">molecular</a> levels, for single-celled organisms such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">bacteria</a> as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">humans</a>. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/a/Anatomy.htm" title="Anatomy">Anatomy</a> considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as <!--del_lnk--> organs and organ systems.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">Genetics</a> is the science of <!--del_lnk--> genes, <!--del_lnk--> heredity, and the variation of <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a>. Genes encode the information necessary for synthesizing proteins, which in turn play a large role in influencing (though, in many instances, not completely determining) the final <!--del_lnk--> phenotype of the organism. In modern research, genetics provides important tools in the investigation of the function of a particular gene, or the analysis of <!--del_lnk--> genetic interactions. Within organisms, genetic information generally is carried in <!--del_lnk--> chromosomes, where it is represented in the <!--del_lnk--> chemical structure of particular <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Molecule.htm" title="Molecule">molecules</a>.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Developmental biology studies the process by which organisms grow and develop. Originating in <!--del_lnk--> embryology, modern developmental biology studies the genetic control of <!--del_lnk--> cell growth, <!--del_lnk--> differentiation, and "<!--del_lnk--> morphogenesis," which is the process that progressively gives rise to <!--del_lnk--> tissues, <!--del_lnk--> organs, and <a href="../../wp/a/Anatomy.htm" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Model organisms for developmental biology include the round worm <i><!--del_lnk--> Caenorhabditis elegans,</i> the fruit fly <i><a href="../../wp/d/Drosophila_melanogaster.htm" title="Drosophila melanogaster">Drosophila melanogaster</a>,</i> the zebrafish <i><!--del_lnk--> Danio rerio,</i> the mouse <i><!--del_lnk--> Mus musculus,</i>, and the weed <i><!--del_lnk--> Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. (A model organism is a <a href="../../wp/s/Species.htm" title="Species">species</a> that is extensively studied to understand particular biological <!--del_lnk--> phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in that organism provide insight into the workings of other organisms.)</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Physiological">Physiological</span></h3>
       <p>Physiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into <!--del_lnk--> plant physiology and <!--del_lnk--> animal physiology, but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organism</a> is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of <a href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Yeast">yeast</a> cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of <!--del_lnk--> human physiology to non-human species. Plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields.</p>
       <p>Physiology studies how for example <!--del_lnk--> nervous, <a href="../../wp/i/Immune_system.htm" title="Immune system">immune</a>, <!--del_lnk--> endocrine, <!--del_lnk--> respiratory, and <!--del_lnk--> circulatory systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medically</a> oriented disciplines such as <!--del_lnk--> neurology and <!--del_lnk--> immunology.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Evolutionary">Evolutionary</span></h3>
       <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Evolutionary_biology.htm" title="Current research in evolutionary biology">Evolutionary research</a> is concerned with the origin and descent of <a href="../../wp/s/Species.htm" title="Species">species</a>, as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a> such as <!--del_lnk--> mammalogy, <!--del_lnk--> ornithology, <a href="../../wp/b/Botany.htm" title="Botany">botany</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> herpetology, but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.</p>
       <p>Evolutionary biology is partly based on <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">paleontology</a>, which uses the <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossil</a> record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as <!--del_lnk--> population genetics and evolutionary theory. In the 1980s, <!--del_lnk--> developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the <!--del_lnk--> modern synthesis through the study of <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary developmental biology. Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are <!--del_lnk--> phylogenetics, <!--del_lnk--> systematics, and <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy.</p>

       <p>
        <br /> Multiple <!--del_lnk--> speciation events create a tree structured system of relationships between species. The role of <!--del_lnk--> systematics is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species. However, systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was common. The classification, <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy, and nomenclature of biological organisms is administered by the <!--del_lnk--> International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, <!--del_lnk--> International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, and <!--del_lnk--> International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria for animals, plants, and bacteria, respectively. The classification of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/v/Virus.htm" title="Viruses">viruses</a>, <!--del_lnk--> viroids, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Prion.htm" title="Prions">prions</a>, and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the <!--del_lnk--> International Code of Virus classification and nomenclature. However, several other viral classification systems do exist.</p>
       <p>Traditionally, living things have been divided into five kingdoms: <!--del_lnk--> Monera; <!--del_lnk--> Protista; <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">Fungi</a>; <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">Plantae</a>; <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">Animalia</a>.</p>
       <p>However, many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the <!--del_lnk--> three-domain system: <!--del_lnk--> Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">Bacteria</a> (originally Eubacteria); <a href="../../wp/e/Eukaryote.htm" title="Eukaryote">Eukaryota</a> (including <!--del_lnk--> protists, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungi">fungi</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plants">plants</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a>) These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.</p>
       <p>Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is: <!--del_lnk--> Domain; <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom; <!--del_lnk--> Phylum; <!--del_lnk--> Class; <!--del_lnk--> Order; <!--del_lnk--> Family; <a href="../../wp/g/Genus.htm" title="Genus">Genus</a>; <a href="../../wp/s/Species.htm" title="Species">Species</a>.</p>
       <p>There is also a series of intracellular <!--del_lnk--> parasites that are "on the edge of life" in terms of <!--del_lnk--> metabolic activity, meaning that many scientists do not actually classify these structures as alive, due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions that define life. They are classified as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/v/Virus.htm" title="Virus (biology)">viruses</a>, <!--del_lnk--> viroids, <a href="../../wp/p/Prion.htm" title="Prion">prions</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> satellites.</p>
       <p>The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Homo sapiens">Homo sapiens</a></i>. <i>Homo</i> is the genus, and <i>sapiens</i> the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.</p>
       <p>The dominant classification system is called the <!--del_lnk--> Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and <a href="../../wp/b/Binomial_nomenclature.htm" title="Binomial nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a>. How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the <!--del_lnk--> International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN), the <!--del_lnk--> International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), and the <!--del_lnk--> International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (ICNB).</p>
       <p>A merging draft, <!--del_lnk--> BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted. The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed. However, a 2004 paper concerning the <!--del_lnk--> cyanobacteria does advocate a future adoption of a BioCode and interim steps consisting of reducing the differences between the codes. The <!--del_lnk--> International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN) remains outside the BioCode.</p>

The <!--del_lnk--> habitat of an organism can be described as the local <!--del_lnk--> abiotic factors such as <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecology</a>, in addition to the other organisms and <!--del_lnk--> biotic factors that share its environment. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on the smallest of scales. A microscopic <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">bacterium</a> responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion is responding to its environment when it searches for food in the African <!--del_lnk--> savanna. For any given species, <!--del_lnk--> behaviors can be <!--del_lnk--> co-operative, <!--del_lnk--> aggressive, <!--del_lnk--> parasitic, or <!--del_lnk--> symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more different species interact in an <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem. Studies of this type are within the province of ecology.</p>
       <p>Ecological systems are studied at several different levels, from individuals and <!--del_lnk--> populations to <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems and the <a href="../../wp/b/Biosphere.htm" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>. The term <!--del_lnk--> population biology is often used interchangeably with <!--del_lnk--> population ecology, although <i>population biology</i> is more frequently used when studying <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Disease.htm" title="Diseases">diseases</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/v/Virus.htm" title="Viruses">viruses</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> microbes, while population ecology is more commonly when studying plants and animals. As can be surmised, ecology is a science that draws on several disciplines.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Ethology studies animal <!--del_lnk--> behaviour (particularly that of social animals such as <!--del_lnk--> primates and <!--del_lnk--> canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology.
