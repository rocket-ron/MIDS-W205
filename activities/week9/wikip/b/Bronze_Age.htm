       <p>The <b>Bronze Age</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> period characterized by the use of <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> and its <!--del_lnk--> alloy <!--del_lnk--> bronze and <!--del_lnk--> proto-writing, and other features of urban <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a>.</p>
       <p>The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the <!--del_lnk--> three-age system, as proposed in modern times by <!--del_lnk--> Christian J&uuml;rgensen Thomsen, for classifying and studying ancient societies. An ancient civilization can be in the Bronze Age either by smelting its own copper and alloying with <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a>, or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Copper-tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in <!--del_lnk--> western Asia before the <!--del_lnk--> third millennium BC. Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally followed the <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic period, but in some parts of the world, a <!--del_lnk--> Copper Age served as a transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age, in some areas, the Iron Age intruded directly on the Neolithic from outside the region except for <a href="../../wp/s/Sub-Saharan_Africa.htm" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> where it was developed independently.</p>
       <p>Bronze Age cultures differed in their <!--del_lnk--> development of the first writing. According to archaeological evidence, cultures in <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> (<!--del_lnk--> hieroglyphs), the <!--del_lnk--> Near East (<!--del_lnk--> cuneiform)&mdash;and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, with the Mycenaean culture (<!--del_lnk--> Linear B)&mdash;had viable writing systems.</p>

       <p>The term "Bronze Age" ultimately derives from the <i><!--del_lnk--> Ages of Man</i>, the stages of human existence on the Earth according to <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>. Of these, modern historians categorize the <i><!--del_lnk--> Golden Age</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Silver Age</i> as mythical, but consider the Bronze Age and <i><a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a></i> historically valid. The overall period is characterized by the full adoption of bronze in many regions, though the place and time of the introduction and development of bronze technology was not universally synchronous. Man-made tin bronze technology requires set production techniques. Tin must be mined (mainly as the tin ore <!--del_lnk--> cassiterite) and smelted separately, then added to molten copper to make the bronze alloy. The Bronze Age was a time of heavy use of metals and of developing trade networks (See <i><!--del_lnk--> Tin sources and trade in ancient times</i>).</p>

       <p>The Bronze Age in the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Near East began with the rise of <a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumer</a> in the 4th millennium BC. Cultures in the ancient Near East (often called, "the <!--del_lnk--> cradle of civilization") practised intensive year-round agriculture, developed a writing system, invented the <!--del_lnk--> potter's wheel, created a centralized government, law codes, and empires, and introduced <!--del_lnk--> social stratification, <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a>, and organized warfare.

       <p>In <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Mesopotamia Bronze Age begins about 2900 BC and ends with the <!--del_lnk--> Kassite period. The usual tripartite division into an Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age is not used. Instead, a division primarily based on art-historical and historical characteristics is more common. The <!--del_lnk--> cities of the Ancient Near East housed several tens of thousands of people. <!--del_lnk--> Ur in the Middle Bronze Age and <!--del_lnk--> Babylon in the Late Bronze Age similarly had large populations.</p>
       <p>The earliest mention of <a href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> appears on a tablet from the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Sargon of Akkad in the 23rd century BC. The <!--del_lnk--> Amorite dynasty established the city-state of Babylon in the 19th century BC. Over 100 years later, it briefly took over the other city-states and formed the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonian empire">Babylonian empire</a> during what is also called the <!--del_lnk--> Old Babylonian Period. Babylonia adopted the written Semitic Akkadian language for official use. By that time, the Sumerian language was no longer spoken, but was still in religious use. The <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian and <a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumerian</a> traditions played a major role in later Babylonian culture, and the region, even under outside rule, remained an important cultural centre throughout the Bronze and Early Iron Age.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Elam was an ancient civilization located to the east of Mesopotamia. In the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age), Elam consisted of kingdoms on the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian plateau, centered in <!--del_lnk--> Anshan, and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in <!--del_lnk--> Susa in the <!--del_lnk--> Khuzestan lowlands. Its culture played a crucial role in the <!--del_lnk--> Gutian Empire and especially during the <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded it.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Oxus civilization was a Bronze Age <!--del_lnk--> Central Asian culture dated to ca. 2300&ndash;1700 BC and centered on the upper <!--del_lnk--> Amu Darya (Oxus). In the Early Bronze Age the culture of the <!--del_lnk--> Kopet Dag oases and <!--del_lnk--> Altyn-Depe developed a proto-urban society. This corresponds to level IV at <!--del_lnk--> Namazga-Depe. Altyn-Depe was a major centre even then. Pottery was wheel-turned. Grapes were grown. The height of this urban development was reached in the Middle Bronze Age c. 2300 BC, corresponding to level V at Namazga-Depe. This Bronze Age culture is called the <!--del_lnk--> Bactria&ndash;Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC).</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Kulli culture, similar to those of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus Valley">Indus Valley</a> Civilization, was located in southern <!--del_lnk--> Balochistan (Gedrosia) ca. 2500 - 2000 BC. Agriculture was the economical base of this people. At several places dams were found, providing evidence for a highly developed water management system.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Konar Sandal is associated with the hypothesized "<!--del_lnk--> Jiroft culture", a 3rd millennium BC culture postulated on the basis of a collection of artifacts confiscated in 2001.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Anatolia">Anatolia</span></h4>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Hittite Empire was established in <!--del_lnk--> Hattusa in northern Anatolia from the <!--del_lnk--> 18th century BC. In the 14th century BC, the Hittite Kingdom was at its height, encompassing central Anatolia, southwestern <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> as far as <!--del_lnk--> Ugarit, and upper <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. After 1180 BC, amid general turmoil in the <!--del_lnk--> Levant associated with the sudden arrival of the <!--del_lnk--> Sea Peoples, the kingdom disintegrated into several independent "Neo-Hittite" city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BC.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Arzawa in Western Anatolia during the second half of the <!--del_lnk--> second millennium BC likely extended along southern Anatolia in a belt that reaches from near the <!--del_lnk--> Turkish Lakes Region to the <!--del_lnk--> Aegean coast. <!--del_lnk--> Arzawa was the western neighbour&mdash;sometimes a rival and sometimes a vassal&mdash;of the <!--del_lnk--> Middle and New Hittite Kingdoms.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Assuwa league was a confederation of states in western Anatolia that was defeated by the Hittites under an earlier <!--del_lnk--> Tudhaliya I, around 1400 BC. Arzawa has been associated with the much more obscure <!--del_lnk--> Assuwa generally located to its north. It probably bordered it, and may even be an alternative term for it (at least during some periods).</p>

This era ended in northern Mesopotamia with the expulsion of the Amorite dominated Babylonians from Assyria by <!--del_lnk--> King Adasi c. 1720 BC, and in the south with the Hittite sack of Babylon (c. 1595 BC), which brought new ethnic groups&mdash;particularly <!--del_lnk--> Kassites&mdash;to the forefront in southern Mesopotamia. From the 15th century BC onward, the term <!--del_lnk--> Amurru is usually applied to the region extending north of Canaan as far as <!--del_lnk--> Kadesh on the <!--del_lnk--> Orontes.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mitanni was a loosely organized state in northern Syria and south-east Anatolia from ca. 1500 BC&ndash;1300 BC. Founded by an Indo-Aryan ruling class that governed a predominately Hurrian population, Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of Kassite Babylon created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia. At its beginning, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the Thutmosids. However, with the ascent of the Hittite empire, Mitanni and Egypt made an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. At the height of its power, during the 14th century BC, it had outposts centered around its capital, Washukanni, which archaeologists have located on the headwaters of the Khabur River. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite, and later Assyrian attacks, and was reduced to a province of the Middle Assyrian Empire.</p>
       <p>The earliest known <!--del_lnk--> Ugarit contact with Egypt (and the first exact dating of Ugaritic civilization) comes from a carnelian bead identified with the Middle Kingdom pharaoh Senusret I, 1971 BC&ndash;1926 BC. A stela and a statuette from the Egyptian pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhet III have also been found. However, it is unclear at what time these monuments got to Ugarit. Amarna letters from Ugarit ca. 1350 BC records one letter each from Ammittamru I, Niqmaddu II, and his queen. From the 16th to the 13th century BC Ugarit remained in constant touch with Egypt and Cyprus (named Alashiya).</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Aramaeans are a Northwest Semitic semi-nomadic and pastoralist people who originated in what is now modern Syria (Biblical Aram) during the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Large groups migrated to Mesopotamia where they intermingled with the native Akkadian (Assyrian and Babylonian) population. The Aramaeans never had a unified empire; they were divided into independent kingdoms all across the Near East. After the Bronze Age collapse, their political influence was confined to a number of Syro-Hittite states, which were entirely absorbed into the Neo-Assyrian Empire by the 8th century BC.</p>

       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_Bronze_dynasties">Early Bronze dynasties</span></h5>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, the Bronze Age begins in the <!--del_lnk--> Protodynastic period, c. 3150 BC. The archaic <i>early Bronze Age of Egypt</i>, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Early Dynastic Period of Egypt, immediately follows the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt, c. 3100 BC. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from <!--del_lnk--> Abydos to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period. <!--del_lnk--> Memphis in the Early Bronzee Age was the largest city of the time. The <!--del_lnk--> Old Kingdom of the regional Bronze Age is the name given to the period in the 3rd millennium BC when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization in complexity and achievement &ndash; the first of three "Kingdom" periods, which mark the high points of civilization in the <a href="../../wp/g/Geography_of_Egypt.htm#Nile_Valley_and_Delta" title="Geography of Egypt">lower Nile Valley</a> (the others being <!--del_lnk--> Middle Kingdom and the <!--del_lnk--> New Kingdom).</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> First Intermediate Period of Egypt, often described as a "dark period" in ancient Egyptian history, spanned about 100 years after the end of the Old Kingdom from about 2181 to 2055 BC. Very little monumental evidence survives from this period, especially from the early part of it. The First Intermediate Period was a dynamic time when rule of Egypt was roughly divided between two competing power bases: <!--del_lnk--> Heracleopolis in Lower Egypt and <!--del_lnk--> Thebes in Upper Egypt. These two kingdoms would eventually come into conflict, with the Theban kings conquering the north, resulting in reunification of Egypt under a single ruler during the second part of the 11th Dynasty.</p>
       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Middle_Bronze_dynasties">Middle Bronze dynasties</span></h5>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Middle Kingdom of Egypt lasted from 2055 to 1650 BC. During this period, the <!--del_lnk--> Osiris funerary cult rose to dominate Egyptian popular religion. The period comprises two phases: the 11th Dynasty, which ruled from Thebes and the 12th and 13th Dynasties centered around <!--del_lnk--> el-Lisht. The unified kingdom was previously considered to comprise the 11th and 12th Dynasties, but historians now at least partially consider the 13th Dynasty to belong to the Middle Kingdom.</p>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Second Intermediate Period, Ancient Egypt fell into disarray for a second time, between the end of the Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom. It is best known for the <!--del_lnk--> Hyksos, whose reign comprised the 15th and 16th dynasties. The Hyksos first appeared in Egypt during the 11th Dynasty, began their climb to power in the 13th Dynasty, and emerged from the Second Intermediate Period in control of <!--del_lnk--> Avaris and the <!--del_lnk--> Delta. By the 15th Dynasty, they ruled lower Egypt, and they were expelled at the end of the 17th Dynasty.</p>
       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Late_Bronze_dynasties">Late Bronze dynasties</span></h5>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> New Kingdom of Egypt, also referred to as the Egyptian Empire, lasted from the 16th to the 11th century BC. The New Kingdom followed the Second Intermediate Period and was succeeded by the <!--del_lnk--> Third Intermediate Period. It was Egypt's most prosperous time and marked the peak of Egypt's power. The later New Kingdom, i.e. the 19th and 20th Dynasties (1292-1069 BC), is also known as the <!--del_lnk--> Ramesside period, after the eleven pharaohs that took the name of Ramesses.</p>

       <p>Historians disagree about the dates of a "Bronze Age" in China. The difficulty lies in the term "Bronze Age", as it has been applied to signify a period in history when bronze tools replaced stone tools, and, later, were themselves replaced by iron ones. The medium of the new "Age" made that of the old obsolete. In China, however, any attempt to establish a definite set of dates for a Bronze Age is complicated by two factors:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>arrival of iron smelting technology, and</li>
        <li>persistence of bronze objects.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>The earliest bronze artifacts have been found in the <!--del_lnk--> Majiayao culture site (between 3100 and 2700 BC), and from then on, the society gradually grew into the Bronze Age.</p>
       <p>Bronze metallurgy in China originated in what is referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Erlitou (<!--del_lnk--> Wade&ndash;Giles: Erh-li-t'ou) period, which some historians argue places it within the range of dates controlled by the <!--del_lnk--> Shang dynasty. Others believe the Erlitou sites belong to the preceding <!--del_lnk--> Xia (<!--del_lnk--> Wade&ndash;Giles: Hsia) dynasty. The U.S. <!--del_lnk--> National Gallery of Art defines the Chinese Bronze Age as the "period between about 2000 BC and 771 BC," a period that begins with Erlitou culture and ends abruptly with the disintegration of <!--del_lnk--> Western Zhou rule. Though this provides a concise frame of reference, it overlooks the continued importance of bronze in Chinese metallurgy and culture. Since this is significantly later than the discovery of bronze in Mesopotamia, bronze technology could have been imported rather than discovered independently in China. While there may be reason to believe that bronzework developed inside China separately from outside influence, the discovery of European <!--del_lnk--> mummies in Xinjiang suggests a possible route of transmission from the West.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Shang Dynasty of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/y/Yellow_River.htm" title="Yellow River Valley">Yellow River Valley</a> rose to power after the <!--del_lnk--> Xia Dynasty. While some direct information about the Shang Dynasty comes from Shang-era inscriptions on bronze artifacts, most comes from oracle bones &mdash; turtle shells, cattle scapulae, or other bones, which bear glyphs that form the first significant corpus of recorded Chinese characters.</p>
       <p>Iron is found from the <!--del_lnk--> Zhou Dynasty, but its use is minimal. Chinese literature dating to the 6th century BC attests a knowledge of iron smelting, yet bronze continues to occupy the seat of significance in the archaeological and historical record for some time after this. Historian W. C. White argues that iron did not supplant bronze "at any period before the end of the Zhou dynasty (256 BC)" and that bronze vessels make up the majority of metal vessels all the way through the <!--del_lnk--> Later Han period, or to 221 BC.</p>
       <p>The Chinese bronze artifacts generally are either utilitarian, like spear points or adze heads, or <!--del_lnk--> "ritual bronzes", which are more elaborate versions in precious materials of everyday vessels, as well as tools and weapons. Examples are the numerous large sacrificial tripods known as <!--del_lnk--> dings in Chinese; there are many other distinct shapes. Surviving identified Chinese ritual bronzes tend to be highly decorated, often with the <i><!--del_lnk--> taotie</i> motif, which involves highly stylized animal face(s). These appear in three main motif types: those of demons, of symbolic animals, and of abstract symbols. Many large bronzes also bear <!--del_lnk--> cast inscriptions that are the great bulk of the surviving body of early <!--del_lnk--> Chinese writing and have helped historians and archaeologists piece together the history of China, especially during the Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BC).</p>
       <p>The bronzes of the Western Zhou Dynasty document large portions of history not found in the extant texts that were often composed by persons of varying rank and possibly even social class. Further, the medium of cast bronze lends the record they preserve a permanence not enjoyed by manuscripts. These inscriptions can commonly be subdivided into four parts: a reference to the date and place, the naming of the event commemorated, the list of gifts given to the artisan in exchange for the bronze, and a dedication. The relative points of reference these vessels provide have enabled historians to place most of the vessels within a certain time frame of the Western Zhou period, allowing them to trace the evolution of the vessels and the events they record.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Korea">Korea</span></h4>
       <p>The beginning of the Bronze Age on the peninsula is around 900 BC - 800 BC. Although the Korean Bronze Age culture derives from the <!--del_lnk--> Liaoning and Manchuria, it exhibits unique typology and styles, especially in ritual objects.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mumun pottery period is named after the Korean name for undecorated or plain cooking and storage vessels that form a large part of the pottery assemblage over the entire length of the period, but especially 850-550 BC. The Mumun period is known for the origins of intensive agriculture and complex societies in both the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago.</p>
       <p>The Middle Mumun pottery period culture of the southern <!--del_lnk--> Korean Peninsula gradually adopted bronze production (c. 700&ndash;600? BC) after a period when Liaoning-style bronze daggers and other bronze artifacts were exchanged as far as the interior part of the Southern Peninsula (c. 900&ndash;700 BC). The bronze daggers lent prestige and authority to the personages who wielded and were buried with them in high-status megalithic burials at south-coastal centres such as the <!--del_lnk--> Igeum-dong site. Bronze was an important element in ceremonies and as for mortuary offerings until 100.</p>

       <p>The Aegean Bronze Age begins around 3200 BC, when civilizations first established a far-ranging <a href="../../wp/t/Trade.htm" title="Trade">trade</a> network. This network imported <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a> and charcoal to <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, where <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> was mined and alloyed with the tin to produce bronze.

       <p>Knowledge of <!--del_lnk--> navigation was well developed at this time, and reached a peak of skill not exceeded (except perhaps by <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian sailors) until 1730 when the invention of the <!--del_lnk--> chronometer enabled the precise determination of <!--del_lnk--> longitude.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/m/Minoan_civilization.htm" title="Minoan civilization">Minoan civilization</a> based in <!--del_lnk--> Knossos appears to have coordinated and defended its Bronze Age trade. <!--del_lnk--> Illyrians are also believed to have roots in the early Bronze Age. Ancient empires valued <!--del_lnk--> luxury goods in contrast to <!--del_lnk--> staple foods, leading to famine.</p>
       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Aegean_Collapse">Aegean Collapse</span></h5>
       <p>Bronze Age collapse theories have described aspects of the end of the Age in this region. At the end of the Bronze Age in the Aegean region, the <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean administration of the regional trade empire followed the decline of Minoan primacy. Several Minoan <!--del_lnk--> client states lost much of their population to famine and/or pestilence. This would indicate that the trade network may have failed, preventing the trade that would previously have relieved such famines and prevented illness caused by malnutrition. It is also known that in this era the <!--del_lnk--> breadbasket of the Minoan empire, the area north of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>, also suddenly lost much of its population, and thus probably some cultivation.</p>
       <p>The Aegean Collapse has been attributed to the exhaustion of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> forests causing the end of the bronze trade. These forests are known to have existed into later times, and experiments have shown that <!--del_lnk--> charcoal production on the scale necessary for the bronze production of the late Bronze Age would have exhausted them in less than fifty years.</p>
       <p>Aegean Collapse has also been attributed to the fact that as <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> <!--del_lnk--> tools became more common, the main justification for the tin trade ended, and that trade network ceased to function as it did formerly. The colonies of the Minoan empire then suffered drought, famine, war, or some combination of those three, and had no access to the distant resources of an empire by which they could easily recover.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Thera eruption occurred around the Aegean Collapse, 110&nbsp;km (68&nbsp;mi) north of Crete. Speculation include a <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a> from Thera (more commonly known today as Santorini) destroyed Cretan cities. A tsunami may have destroyed the Cretan <!--del_lnk--> navy in its home harbour, which then lost crucial naval battles; so that in the <!--del_lnk--> LMIB/LMII event (c. 1450 BC) the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Crete burned and the <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean civilization took over <!--del_lnk--> Knossos. If the eruption occurred in the late 17th century BC (as most chronologists now think) then its immediate effects belong to the Middle to Late Bronze Age transition, and not to the end of the Late Bronze Age; but it could have triggered the instability that led to the collapse first of Knossos and then of Bronze Age society overall. One such theory looks to the role of Cretan expertise in administering the empire, post-Thera. If this expertise was concentrated in Crete, then the Mycenaeans may have made political and commercial mistakes in administering the Cretan empire.</p>
       <p>Archaeological findings, including some on the island of Thera, suggest that the centre of Minoan Civilization at the time of the eruption was actually on Thera rather than on Crete. According to this theory, the catastrophic loss of the political, administrative and economic centre by the eruption as well as the damage wrought by the tsunami to the coastal towns and villages of Crete precipitated the decline of the Minoans. A weakened political entity with a reduced economic and military capability and fabled riches would have then been more vulnerable to human predators. Indeed, the Santorini Eruption is usually dated to c. 1630 BC, while the Mycenaean Greeks first enter the historical record a few decades later, c. 1600 BC. Thus, the later Mycenaean assaults on Crete (c.1450 BC) and Troy (c.1250 BC) are revealed as mere continuations of the steady encroachments of the Greeks upon the weakened Minoan world.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Apennine culture (also called Italian Bronze Age) is a technology complex of central and southern Italy spanning the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age proper. The <!--del_lnk--> Camuni were an ancient people of uncertain origin (according to <!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Elder, they were <!--del_lnk--> Euganei; according to <!--del_lnk--> Strabo, they were <!--del_lnk--> Rhaetians) who lived in <!--del_lnk--> Val Camonica - in what is now northern <!--del_lnk--> Lombardy - during the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>, although human groups of hunters, shepherds and farmers are known to have lived in the area since the <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic.</p>
       <p>Located in <!--del_lnk--> Sardinia and <!--del_lnk--> Corsica, the <!--del_lnk--> Nuragic civilization lasted from the early Bronze Age (18th century BC) to the 2nd century AD, when the islands were already Romanized. They take their name from the characteristic nuragic towers, which evolved from the pre-existing megalithic culture, which built <!--del_lnk--> dolmens and <!--del_lnk--> menhirs. The nuraghe towers are unanimously considered the best preserved and largest megalithic remains in Europe. Their effective use is still debated: some scholars considered them as monumental tombs, others as <!--del_lnk--> Houses of the Giants, other as fortresses, ovens for metal fusion, prisons or, finally, temples for a solar cult.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Terramare was an early <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European civilization in the area of what is now <!--del_lnk--> Pianura Padana (northern Italy) before the arrival of the <!--del_lnk--> Celts, and in other parts of Europe. They lived in square villages of wooden <!--del_lnk--> stilt houses. These villages were built on land, but generally near a stream, with roads that crossed each other at <!--del_lnk--> right angles. The whole complex denoted the nature of a fortified settlement. Terramare were widespread in the Pianura Padana (specially along the <!--del_lnk--> Panaro river, between <!--del_lnk--> Modena and <a href="../../wp/b/Bologna.htm" title="Bologna">Bologna</a>) and in the rest of Europe. The civilization developed in the Middle and Late Bronze Age, between the 17th and the 13th centuries BC.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Castellieri culture developed in <!--del_lnk--> Istria during the Middle Bronze Age. It lasted for more than a millennium, from the 15th century BC until the Roman conquest in the 3rd century BC. It takes its name from the fortified boroughs (<i>Castellieri</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Friulian <i>cjastelir</i>) that characterized the culture.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Canegrate culture developed from the mid-Bronze Age (13th century BC) till the Iron Age in the <!--del_lnk--> Pianura Padana, in what is are now western <!--del_lnk--> Lombardy, eastern <!--del_lnk--> Piedmont and <!--del_lnk--> Ticino. It takes its name from the township of <!--del_lnk--> Canegrate where, in the 20th century, some fifty tombs with ceramics and metal objects were found. The Canegrate culture migrated from the northwest part of the Alps and descended to <!--del_lnk--> Pianura Padana from the Swiss Alps passes and the Ticino.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Golasecca culture developed starting from the late Bronze Age in the <!--del_lnk--> Po plain. It takes its name from Golasecca, a locality next to the <!--del_lnk--> Ticino where, in the early 19th century, abbot Giovanni Battista Giani excavated its first findings (some fifty tombs with ceramics and metal objects). Remains of the Golasecca culture span an area of c. 20,000 square kilometers south to the Alps, between the Po, <!--del_lnk--> Sesia and <!--del_lnk--> Serio rivers, dating from the 9th to the 4th century BC.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Bronze Age is a cultural complex of the period of approximately 1300&ndash;700 BC that includes different cultures in Portugal, Andalusia, Galicia and the British Isles. It is marked by economic and cultural exchange. Commercial contacts extend to Denmark and the Mediterranean. The Atlantic Bronze Age was defined by a number of distinct regional centres of metal production, unified by a regular maritime exchange of some of their products.</p>
       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Great_Britain">Great Britain</span></h5>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, the Bronze Age is considered to have been the period from around 2100 to 740 BC. <!--del_lnk--> Migration brought new people to the islands from the continent. Recent tooth enamel isotope research on bodies found in early Bronze Age graves around <a href="../../wp/s/Stonehenge.htm" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> indicate that at least some of the migrants came from the area of modern <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Beaker culture displayed different behaviours from the earlier <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic people, and cultural change was significant. Integration is thought to have been peaceful, as many of the early <!--del_lnk--> henge sites were seemingly adopted by the newcomers. The rich <!--del_lnk--> Wessex culture developed in southern Britain at this time. Additionally, the climate was deteriorating; where once the weather was warm and dry it became much wetter as the Bronze Age continued, forcing the population away from easily defended sites in the hills and into the fertile <!--del_lnk--> valleys. Large livestock farms developed in the lowlands and appear to have contributed to economic growth and inspired increasing forest clearances. The <!--del_lnk--> Deverel-Rimbury culture began to emerge in the second half of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1400&ndash;1100 BC) to exploit these conditions. <!--del_lnk--> Devon and <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall were major sources of <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a> for much of western Europe and <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> was extracted from sites such as the <!--del_lnk--> Great Orme mine in northern <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>. Social groups appear to have been tribal but with growing complexity and hierarchies becoming apparent.</p>
       <p>Burial of dead (which, until this period, had usually been communal) became more individual. For example, whereas in the Neolithic a large <!--del_lnk--> chambered cairn or <!--del_lnk--> long barrow housed the dead, Early Bronze Age people buried their dead in individual <!--del_lnk--> barrows (also commonly known and marked on modern British <!--del_lnk--> Ordnance Survey maps as tumuli), or sometimes in <!--del_lnk--> cists covered with <!--del_lnk--> cairns.</p>
       <p>The greatest quantities of bronze objects in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> were discovered in <!--del_lnk--> East Cambridgeshire, where the most important finds were recovered in <!--del_lnk--> Isleham (more than <!--del_lnk--> 6500 pieces). Alloying of copper with zinc or tin to make <!--del_lnk--> brass or <!--del_lnk--> bronze was practised soon after the discovery of copper itself. One copper mine at <!--del_lnk--> Great Orme in North Wales, extended to a depth of 70 meters. At <!--del_lnk--> Alderley Edge in <!--del_lnk--> Cheshire, carbon dates have established mining at around 2280 to 1890 BC (at 95% probability). The earliest identified metalworking site (Sigwells, Somerset) is much later, dated by Globular Urn style pottery to approximately the 12th century BC. The identifiable sherds from over 500 mould fragments included a perfect fit of the hilt of a sword in the Wilburton style held in Somerset County Museum.</p>
       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ireland">Ireland</span></h5>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Bronze Age in Ireland commenced around 2000 BC, when copper was alloyed with tin and used to manufacture <!--del_lnk--> Ballybeg type flat axes and associated metalwork. The preceding period is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Copper Age and is characterised by the production of <!--del_lnk--> flat axes, <!--del_lnk--> daggers, <!--del_lnk--> halberds and <!--del_lnk--> awls in copper. The period is divided into three phases: <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Early Bronze Age">Early Bronze Age</a> (2000&ndash;1500 BC), <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Middle Bronze Age">Middle Bronze Age</a> (1500&ndash;1200 BC), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Late Bronze Age">Late Bronze Age</a> (1200&nbsp;&ndash; c. 500 BC). Ireland is also known for a relatively large number of Early Bronze Age <!--del_lnk--> burials.</p>
       <p>One of the characteristic types of artifact of the Early Bronze Age in Ireland is the <!--del_lnk--> flat axe. There are five main types of flat axes: <!--del_lnk--> Lough Ravel (c. 2200 BC), Ballybeg (c. 2000 BC), <!--del_lnk--> Killaha (c. 2000 BC), <!--del_lnk--> Ballyvalley (c. 2000&ndash;1600 BC), <!--del_lnk--> Derryniggin (c. 1600 BC), and a number of metal ingots in the shape of axes.</p>

       <p>The Bronze Age in Northern Europe spans the entire <!--del_lnk--> 2nd millennium BC (<!--del_lnk--> Unetice culture, <!--del_lnk--> Urnfield culture, <!--del_lnk--> Tumulus culture, <!--del_lnk--> Terramare culture, <!--del_lnk--> Lusatian culture) lasting until ca. 600 BC. The <!--del_lnk--> Northern Bronze Age was both a period and a Bronze Age culture in Scandinavian pre-history, c. 1700-500 BC, with sites that reached as far east as Estonia. Succeeding the Late Neolithic culture, its ethnic and linguistic affinities are unknown in the absence of written sources. It is followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Pre-Roman Iron Age.</p>
       <p>Even though Northern European Bronze Age cultures were fairly late, and came in existence via trade, sites present rich and well-preserved objects made of wool, wood and imported Central European bronze and gold. Many rock carvings depict ships, and the large stone burial monuments known as stone ships suggest that shipping played an important role. Thousands of rock carvings depict ships, most probably representing sewn plank built canoes for warfare, fishing and trade. These may have a history as far back as the neolithic period and continue in to the Pre-Roman Iron Age, as shown by the <!--del_lnk--> Hjortspring boat. There are many mounds and rock carving sites from the period. Numerous artifacts of bronze and gold are found. No written language existed in the Nordic countries during the Bronze Age. The rock carvings have been dated through comparison with depicted artifacts.</p>

The name also appears in English as Pit Grave Culture or Ochre Grave Culture. The <!--del_lnk--> Catacomb culture, ca. 2800-2200 BC, refers to an early Bronze Age culture occupying essentially what is present-day Ukraine. It's seemed more of as an areal term to cover several smaller related archaeological cultures. The <!--del_lnk--> Srubna culture was a Late Bronze Age (18th-12th centuries BC) culture. It is a successor to the Yamna culture, the Pit Grave culture and the Poltavka culture.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> J&#x14D;mon period lasted until 500 BC and, after the end of the period, the Japanese experienced the introduction of bronze and iron simultaneously. Bronze and iron smelting techniques from the Korean peninsula spread to the Japanese archipelago via the Yayoi invaders from the Korean peninsula. Iron was mainly used for agricultural and other tools; whereas, ritual and ceremonial artifacts were mainly made of bronze. The bronze and iron using <!--del_lnk--> Yayoi people slowly began the two thousand year long ethnic cleansing of the J&#x14D;mon people, pushing them west and north.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Africa">Africa</span></h3>
       <p>Although North Africa was influenced to certain extent by European Bronze Age cultures (for examples, traces of the <!--del_lnk--> Bell beaker tradition are found in <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>), Africa did not develop its own metallurgy until the Phoenician colonization (ca. 1100 BC) of North Africa and remained attached to the <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic way of life. The civilization of the Ancient Egypt, whose influence did not cover the rest of Africa, was rather an exception from this rule as regarding the whole range of ancient cultures of Africa.</p>
       <p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, inhabitants at Termit, in eastern Niger, became the first iron smelting people in West Africa and among the first in the world around 1500 BC. Iron and copper working then continued to spread southward through the continent, reaching the Cape around AD 200. The widespread use of iron revolutionized the Bantu-speaking farming communities who adopted it, driving out and absorbing the rock tool using hunter-gatherer societies they encountered as they expanded to farm wider areas of savannah. The technologically superior Bantu-speakers spread across southern Africa and became wealthy and powerful, producing iron for tools and weapons in large, industrial quantities.</p>
       <p>In the region of the A&iuml;r Mountains in Niger we have the development of independent copper smelting between 3000&ndash;2500 BC. The process was not in a developed state, indication smelting was not foreign. It became mature about the 1500 BC.</p>
