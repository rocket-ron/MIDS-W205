<p><strong><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_BHLImage_preview" alt="Mother and child at the SOS Children's Village Poa, Brazil" />Despite being one of the world's great economic powers,&nbsp; poverty and destitution are widespread in Brazil. In the most deprived areas, 97% of children live without access to decent sewerage and risk infection from life-threatening diseases. We have worked to help disadvantaged Brazilian children since the 1960s, and our work continues to improve the lives of many in uncertain times.</strong></p>
<p>Children in Brazil need your support, and you can help by sponsoring a child with SOS Children:</p>
<a title="Sponsor a child in Brazil" style="width: 18em;" class="button" href="../../wp/d/Donation_Options.htm"><span class="inner">Sponsor a child in Brazil</span></a>
<h3>A rapidly growing economy<br /></h3>
<p>Over the last ten years, poverty in Brazil has decreased substantially, and living standards have increased. Despite these improvements, extreme poverty persists in some regions, and income inequality remains a huge problem in a country where much of the land is in the hands of a few wealthy families. In some rural areas, nearly one in three are unable to read or write. In the city, crime rates are high, making Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro among the most dangerous urban centres in the continent.</p>
<h3>Wasted lives for Brazil's children<br /></h3>
<p>For many people, shanty towns are home for life. In these cramped and dirty improvised slums, children grow up amid disease and filth, with little chance of escaping a lifetime of poverty. Child poverty is particularly widespread in the north-east of Brazil. In the state of Alagoas, 57% of children aged 1 to 11 grow up in families forced to survive on less than half the minimum wage. In Piaui state, more than a quarter of 10-15 year olds must work to feed their families.</p>
<p>Children in Brazil face a raft of problems which have terrible lifelong consequences:</p>
<ul><li>Hunger afflicts children throughout Brazil, despite the government's attempts to fight famine and extreme poverty.</li><li>In the big cities, children without parental care often end up on the streets, where even at an early age they are vulnerable to gang violence, sexual abuse and drug addiction.</li><li>Child labour is sometimes the only way to stay alive, and many children shine shoes or sell merchandise by the road just to survive. Without their parents, most of these children live a life of violence, abuse and neglect.</li></ul>
<h2><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_BDLImage_preview" alt="Brazil map" height="281" width="317" />Our charity work in Brazil<br /></h2>
<p>SOS Children has helped make life better for Brazilian children like this since 1967. We currently care for well over a thousand children across 16 Villages in Brazil, and we stay with these children as they approach adulthood, helping them prepare for independence at our SOS Youth Homes. We also provide vocational training for youngsters so they are equipped to practice a profession and earn a steady income in adult life.</p>
<p>Our community work extends this support to many more children and families.Our chief aim is to hold together families at risk of separation to ensure children grow up in the best possible environment. By working with community leaders, we help people overcome local challenges by providing guidance as well as material support such as education and healthcare. Daycare too allows mothers to go out to work while their children are safely looked after.</p>
<h3>Porto Alegre<br /></h3>
<p>The first SOS Children's Village in Brazil, <strong><a title="Child Sponsorship Background from Porto Alegre, Brazil" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/c/Child_Sponsorship_Background_From_Porto_Alegre_Brazil.htm">Porto Alegre</a>,</strong> opened in April 1967. The Village is located in the south of the country, in the capital of the federal state of Rio Grande do Sul. The Village was built on a six-acre site on the outskirts of the city and is home to many children. Older children from the Village usually attend the local state schools. An SOS Youth Home in the city centre allows older children from the SOS Children's Village to adjust to independent life.</p>

Bras&#xED;lia, the country's artificially created capital, has a population of about two million. Bras&#xED;lia was designated as the capital location to promote the development of the country's interior. However, about two thirds of the population live in the huge slums on the outskirts. SOS Children's Village Bras&#xED;lia is situated in the north of the city and is home to many SOS families, as well as accommodating the village director's house, a house for SOS aunts and an administration and service area.

<h3><strong>Life in SOS Children's Villages Brazil: Carlos&#x2019;s story</strong></h3>
<img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_AJMImage_preview" alt="Carlos - now an adult with a future ahead" height="317" width="253" />
<p><strong>Carlos came to SOS Children's Village Jacarepagua aged one and a half. Carlos says that the SOS Children's Village at Jacarepagua has always been his home. He liked the feeling of freedom and independence he experienced there. "The first grade of primary school, at that time, used to be spent within the village, but we could leave and walk out; something impossible at other conventional schools," he remembers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carlos finished second grade in community schools. He started a course in Computer Science and ended up really enjoying it. "I used to help the director of the school to sort out computer problems and I realised that I was quite good with computers, and I improved," he explains.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When he left the village, he went to live alone. Soon he started teaching Computer Science in Jacarepagua. "Towards the end of my contract in 2004 I moved to Ubatuba, where I now work in an accountancy firm as a computer technician," he says.</strong></p>
<p><strong>"SOS Children's Village Jacarepagua is part of my life," Carlos states. "I was happy there and I will love my home for the rest of my life. I thank those who work or have worked there and were part of my development."</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Carlos is certainly a good example of courage and desire to succeed in life. "I want to have my own business. I want to have many customers and to be successful... to have a family ... my own home&#x201D;, he says.</strong></p>
