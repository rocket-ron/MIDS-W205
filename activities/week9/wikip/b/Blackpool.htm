It is situated along England's northwest coast by the <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_Sea.htm" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a>, between the <!--del_lnk--> Ribble and <!--del_lnk--> Wyre estuaries, 17.5 miles (28.2&nbsp;km) northwest of <!--del_lnk--> Preston, 27 miles (43&nbsp;km) north of <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) northwest of <!--del_lnk--> Bolton and 40 miles (64&nbsp;km) northwest of <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>. It has an estimated population of 142,100, and a population density that makes it the fourth most densely populated borough of <!--del_lnk--> England and Wales outside <a href="../../wp/g/Greater_London.htm" title="Greater London">Greater London</a>.</p>
       <p>Throughout the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Early_modern_Britain.htm" title="Early modern Britain">Early Modern period</a>, Blackpool was a coastal hamlet in Lancashire's <!--del_lnk--> Hundred of Amounderness, and remained such until the mid-18th century when it became fashionable in England to travel to the coast during the summer to bathe in sea water to improve well-being. In 1781, visitors attracted to Blackpool's 7-mile (11&nbsp;km) sandy beach were able to use a newly built private road, built by Thomas Clifton and Sir Henry Hoghton. Stagecoaches began running to Blackpool from Manchester in the same year, and from <!--del_lnk--> Halifax in 1782. In the early 19th century, Henry Banks and his son-in-law John Cocker erected new buildings in Blackpool such that its population grew from less than 500 in 1801 to over 2,500 in 1851. St John's Church in Blackpool was consecrated in 1821.</p>
       <p>Blackpool rose to prominence as a major centre of tourism in England when a railway was built in the 1840s connecting it to the industrialised regions of <!--del_lnk--> Northern England. The railway made it much easier and cheaper for visitors to reach Blackpool, triggering an influx of settlers, such that in 1876 Blackpool was <!--del_lnk--> incorporated as a borough, governed by its own town council and aldermen. In 1881 Blackpool was a booming resort with a population of 14,000 and a <!--del_lnk--> promenade complete with piers, fortune-tellers, public houses, trams, donkey rides, fish-and-chip shops and theatres. By 1901 the population of Blackpool was 47,000, by which time its place was cemented as "the archetypal British seaside resort". By 1951 it had grown to 147,000.</p>
       <p>Shifts in tastes, combined with opportunities for Britons to travel overseas, supplanted Blackpool's status as a leading resort during the late 20th century. Nevertheless, Blackpool's urban fabric and economy remains relatively undiversified, and firmly rooted in the tourism sector, and the borough's seafront continues to attract millions of visitors every year. In addition to its sandy beaches, Blackpool's major attractions and landmarks include <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Tower, <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Illuminations, the <!--del_lnk--> Pleasure Beach, <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Zoo, the <!--del_lnk--> Winter Gardens, and the UK's only surviving first-generation <!--del_lnk--> tramway. Blackpool is also noted for its political autonomy, independent of <!--del_lnk--> Lancashire County Council.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Toponymy">Toponymy</span></h3>
       <p>Blackpool gets its name from a historic drainage channel (possibly Spen Dyke) that ran over a <a href="../../wp/b/Bog.htm" title="Bog">peat bog</a>, discharging discoloured water into the Irish Sea, which formed a black pool (on the other side of the sea, "<a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>" (Dubh Linn) is derived from the Irish for "black pool"). Another explanation is that the local dialect for stream was "pul" or "poole", hence "Black poole".</p>
       <p>People originating from Blackpool are called <i>Sandgrown'uns</i> (as are persons originating from <!--del_lnk--> Morecambe and <!--del_lnk--> Southport) or <i>Seasiders</i> (although this is more commonly associated with <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool F.C.). <i>Blackpudlians</i> is also (though rarely) used.</p>

       <p>A 12,000-year-old animal skeleton (the Carleton Elk) found with barbed arrowheads near <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Sixth Form College in 1970 provided the first evidence of humans living on <!--del_lnk--> the Fylde as far back as the <!--del_lnk--> Palaeolithic era. The Fylde was also home to a British tribe, the <!--del_lnk--> Setantii (the "dwellers in the water") a sub-tribe of the <!--del_lnk--> Brigantes, who from about AD80 were controlled by <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> from their fort at Dowbridge, <!--del_lnk--> Kirkham. During the Roman occupation the area was covered by <a href="../../wp/o/Oak.htm" title="Oak">oak</a> forests and bog land.</p>
       <p>Some of the earliest villages on the Fylde, which were later to become part of Blackpool town, were named in the <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> in 1086. Many of them were <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon settlements. Some though had 9th and 10th century <!--del_lnk--> Viking place names. The Vikings and Anglo-Saxons seem to have co-existed peacefully, with some Anglo-Saxon and Viking placenames later being joined together &ndash; such as Layton-with-Warbreck and Bispham-with-Norbreck. Layton was controlled by the Butlers, Barons of <!--del_lnk--> Warrington from the 12th century.</p>
       <p>In <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Medieval">medieval</a> times Blackpool emerged as a few farmsteads on the coast within Layton-with-Warbreck, the name coming from "le pull", a stream that drained <!--del_lnk--> Marton Mere and Marton Moss into the sea close to what is now Manchester Square. The stream ran through peatlands that discoloured the water, so the name for the area became "Black Poole". In the 15th century the area was just called <i>Pul</i>, and a 1532 map calls the area "the pole howsys alias the north howsys&rdquo;.</p>
       <p>In 1602, entries in <!--del_lnk--> Bispham Parish Church baptismal register include both <i>Poole</i> and for the first time <i>blackpoole</i>. The first house of any substance, Foxhall, was built toward the end of the 17th century by Edward Tyldesley, the Squire of <!--del_lnk--> Myerscough and son of the <!--del_lnk--> Royalist Sir Thomas Tyldesley. An <!--del_lnk--> Act of Parliament in 1767 enclosed a <!--del_lnk--> common, mostly sand hills on the coast, that stretched from Spen Dyke southwards. Plots of the land were allocated to landowners in <!--del_lnk--> Bispham, <!--del_lnk--> Layton, Great Marton and Little Marton. The same act also provided for the layout of a number of long straight roads that would be built, such as Lytham Road, St. Annes Road and Highfield Road.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taking_the_cure">Taking the cure</span></h3>
       <p>By the middle of the 18th century, the practice of sea bathing to cure diseases was becoming fashionable among the wealthier classes, and visitors began making the arduous trek to Blackpool for that purpose. In 1781 Thomas Clifton and Sir Henry Hoghton built a private road to Blackpool, and a regular stagecoach service from Manchester and <!--del_lnk--> Halifax was established. A few amenities, including four hotels, an archery stall and <!--del_lnk--> bowling greens, were developed, and the town grew slowly. The <!--del_lnk--> 1801 census records the town's population at 473. The growth was accelerated by the actions of Henry Banks, often considered to be the &ldquo;Father of Blackpool&rdquo;. In 1819 he purchased the Lane Ends estate, including the Lane Ends Hotel, and built the first holiday cottages. In 1837, his son-in-law Dr. John Cocker built Blackpool&rsquo;s first assembly rooms, which still stand on the corner of Victoria Street and Bank Hey Street.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The most significant event in the early growth of the town occurred in 1846, with the completion of a <!--del_lnk--> branch line to Blackpool from Poulton on the main <!--del_lnk--> Preston and Wyre Joint Railway line from <!--del_lnk--> Preston to <!--del_lnk--> Fleetwood. Fleetwood declined as a resort, as its founder and principal financial backer, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, went bankrupt. In contrast, Blackpool boomed. A sudden influx of visitors, arriving by rail, provided the motivation for entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions, leading to more visitors and a rapid cycle of growth throughout the 1850s and 1860s. In 1851 a <!--del_lnk--> Board of Health was formed. <!--del_lnk--> Gas lighting was introduced in 1852, and piped water in 1864. By 1851, the town's population was over 2,500.</p>
       <p>The growth was intensified by the practice among the Lancashire <!--del_lnk--> cotton mill owners of closing the factories for a week every year to service and repair machinery. These became known as <!--del_lnk--> wakes weeks. Each town's mills would close for a different week, allowing Blackpool to manage a steady and reliable stream of visitors over a prolonged period in the summer.</p>
       <p>In 1863, the <!--del_lnk--> North Pier was completed, rapidly becoming a centre of attraction for elite visitors. <!--del_lnk--> Central Pier was completed in 1868, with a theatre and a large open-air dance floor. The town expanded southward beyond what is today known as the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Mile, towards South Shore, and <!--del_lnk--> South Pier was completed in 1893, making Blackpool the only town in the United Kingdom with three piers. In 1878, the <!--del_lnk--> Winter Gardens complex opened, incorporating ten years later the Opera House, said to be the largest in Britain outside of London.</p>
       <p>The town was granted a Charter of Incorporation as a <!--del_lnk--> municipal borough in 1876. W.H. Cocker, son of Dr John Cocker, and therefore grandson of Henry Banks, was its first mayor. The town would become a <!--del_lnk--> county borough in 1904.</p>

       <p>Much of Blackpool's growth and character from the 1870s on was predicated on the town's pioneering use of electrical power. In 1879, it became the first municipality in the world to have electric street lighting, as large parts of the promenade were wired. The lighting and its accompanying pageants reinforced Blackpool's status as the North of England's most prominent holiday resort, and its specifically <!--del_lnk--> working class character. It was the forerunner of the present-day <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Illuminations. In 1885 one of the world's first <!--del_lnk--> electric tramways was laid down as a <!--del_lnk--> conduit line running from Cocker Street to Dean Street on the <!--del_lnk--> Promenade. The line was operated by the Blackpool Electric Tramway Company until 1892 when their lease expired and <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Corporation took over running the line. A further line was added in 1895 from Manchester Square along Lytham Road to South Shore, and the line was extended north, first to Gynn Square in 1899, and then to <!--del_lnk--> Fleetwood. In 1899 the conduit system was replaced by overhead wires. The tramway has remained in continuous service to this day.</p>
       <p>By the 1890s, the town had a population of 35,000, and could accommodate 250,000 holidaymakers. The number of annual visitors, many staying for a week, was estimated at three million. 1894 saw the opening of two of the town's most prominent buildings, the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Theatre on Church Street, and <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Tower on the Promenade. The Grand Theatre was one of Britain's first all-electric theatres.</p>
       <p>The first decade of the new century saw the development of the Promenade as we know it today, and further development southwards beyond South Shore towards Harrowside and <!--del_lnk--> Squires Gate. The <!--del_lnk--> Pleasure Beach was first established about this time. Seasonal static illuminations were first set up in 1912, although due to <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and its aftermath they only enjoyed two seasons until they were re-introduced in 1925. The illuminations extended the holiday season into September and early October.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Towards_the_present">Towards the present</span></h3>
       <p>The inter-war period saw Blackpool attain pre-eminence as a holiday destination. By 1920, Blackpool claimed around eight million visitors per year, three times as many as its nearest British rivals, still drawn largely from the mill towns of East <!--del_lnk--> Lancashire and the <!--del_lnk--> West Riding of Yorkshire. <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Park was laid out in 1920 and opened in 1926. The area round the park has become renowned for some of the most desirable residences in the area.</p>
       <p>In 1937, <!--del_lnk--> Littlewoods opened its first department store in the town.</p>
       <p>Documents have been found to suggest that the reason Blackpool escaped heavy damage in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> was that <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> had earmarked the town to remain a place of leisure after his <!--del_lnk--> planned invasion. Despite this, on 11 September 1940, German bombs fell near <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool North railway station and eight people were killed in nearby houses.</p>
       <p>In the same war, the Free <!--del_lnk--> Polish Air Force made its headquarters in exile at Blackpool in Talbot Square, after the force evacuated to Britain from <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. The nearby <!--del_lnk--> Layton Cemetery contains the war graves of 26 Polish airmen.</p>
       <p>Blackpool's population boom was complete by 1951, by which time some 147,000 people were living in the town&mdash;compared to 47,000 in 1901 and a mere 14,000 in 1881. In the decade after the war, the town continued to attract more visitors, reaching a <!--del_lnk--> zenith of 17 million per year. However, several factors combined to make this growth untenable. The decline of the textile industry led to a de-emphasis of the traditional week-long break. The rise of <!--del_lnk--> package holidays took many of Blackpool's traditional visitors abroad, where the weather was more reliably warm and dry, and improved road communications, epitomised by the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> M55 motorway in 1975, made Blackpool more feasible as a day trip rather than an overnight stay. The economy, however, remains relatively undiversified, and firmly rooted in the tourism sector.</p>

       <p>Between 1904 and 1974, Blackpool formed a <!--del_lnk--> county borough independent of the <!--del_lnk--> administrative county of <!--del_lnk--> Lancashire. With the passage of the <!--del_lnk--> Local Government Act 1972, Blackpool's county borough status was abolished and it was made part of the <!--del_lnk--> shire county of Lancashire. On 1 April 1998, however, Blackpool was made a <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority and re-formed as an autonomous local government unit. It remains part of Lancashire for <!--del_lnk--> ceremonial purposes, however.</p>

       <p>Blackpool is heavily dependent on tourism. In what is often regarded as its heyday (1900&ndash;1950), Blackpool thrived as the factory workers of <!--del_lnk--> Northern England took their annual holidays there en masse. Any photograph from that era shows crowds of tourists on the beach and promenade. Blackpool was also a preferred destination of visitors from <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and remains so to this day. The town went into decline when cheap air travel arrived in the 1960s and the same workers decamped to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> coastal resorts due to competitive prices and the more reliable weather. Today Blackpool remains the most popular seaside resort in the UK; however, the town has suffered a serious drop in numbers of visitors which have fallen from 17 million in 1992 to 10 million today. Similarly <!--del_lnk--> Pleasure Beach Blackpool was the country's most popular free attraction with 6 million visitors a year but has lost over a million visitors since 1998 and has recently introduced a &pound;5 entrance fee. Today, many visitors stay for the weekend rather than for a week at a time.</p>
       <p>In July 2010, an independent survey of 4,500 members of the general public by consumer magazine <i><!--del_lnk--> Which? Holiday</i> (now <i>Which? Travel</i>) found that Blackpool was the UK's favourite seaside resort, followed by <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Whitby, <!--del_lnk--> Bournemouth and <!--del_lnk--> Scarborough. Blackpool has now improved the seawall and promenade, and Blackpool Tower has been revamped.</p>
       <p>In February 2012, a number of tourist attractions in Blackpool collaborated to produce the <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Resort Pass which allows for discounted access in one ticket. The original pass included visits to Merlin Entertainments attractions and Blackpool Pleasure Beach. In February 2013, Marketing Blackpool, formerly the Tourism division of Blackpool Council, led the relaunch of the Blackpool Resort Pass which includes additional attractions including Blackpool Zoo, Sandcastle Waterpark and Blackpool Model Village and Gardens.</p>
       <p>Blackpool has a pioneering publicly owned <!--del_lnk--> Municipal wireless network Wi-Fi, which covers the entire town centre &amp; promenade &amp; beach front. Visitors can take a virtual tour of Blackpool, to discover all they need to know to enjoy their time in Blackpool. Full internet access is available via the publicly owned <!--del_lnk--> Municipal wireless network.</p>

In January 2011, Blackpool hosted the <!--del_lnk--> NEEC Conference (formerly the North of England Education Conference), a key date in the education calendar. The Winter Gardens also hold the National Pensioners' Parliament. <!--del_lnk--> The Imperial Hotel has also hosted a significant number of conferences over the decades.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Entertainment">Entertainment</span></h3>
       <p>Blackpool remains a summer through to the end of the light in November and all holiday periods entertainment venue, specialising in variety shows featuring entertainers such as <!--del_lnk--> Ken Dodd and <!--del_lnk--> Roy 'Chubby' Brown. Ken Dodd can regularly be seen throughout late summer at the Grand Theatre.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Grand Theatre was designed by <!--del_lnk--> Victorian theatre architect <!--del_lnk--> Frank Matcham and was opened in 1894 after a construction period of seven months, at a cost of &pound;20,000 between December 1893 and July 1894. The project was conceived and financed by local theatre manager Thomas Sergenson who had been using the site of the Grand for several years to stage a circus. He had also transformed the fortunes of other local theatres.</p>
       <div class="thumb tright">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:172px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/3208/320834.jpg.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="292" src="../../images/3208/320834.jpg"  width="170" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">
          <div class="magnify"><a class="internal" href="../../images/3208/320834.jpg.htm" title="Enlarge"><img alt="" height="11" src="../../images/3200/320013.png" width="15" /></a></div> Grand Theatre, Blackpool</div>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Matcham's brief was to build Sergenson the "prettiest theatre in the land". The Grand was Matcham's first theatre to use an innovative 'cantilever' design to support the tiers, thereby reducing the need for the usual pillars and so allowing clear views of the stage from all parts of the auditorium.</p>
       <p>Sergenson's successful directorship of the theatre ended in 1909 when he sold the operation to the Blackpool Tower Company for a considerable profit.</p>
       <p>The success of the Grand continued through World War I and on until the 1930s. The theatre now faced stiff competition from the newly introduced talking films and the building was operated as a cinema outside the summer tourist season. This practice continued until 1938 when the nearby Opera House was constructed.</p>
       <p>The Grand was able to stay open during World War II but the post-war rise in the popularity of television was probably the cause of the theatre's dwindling popularity toward the 1960s. Plans were filed for the demolition of the historic site in 1972 but the Grand's status as a Grade II* listed building was sought and obtained by a group of friends, thereby preventing this from taking place. An agreement was reached with the Grand's owners, <!--del_lnk--> EMI, that a refurbishment of the then unused building would take place if it could be used as a <!--del_lnk--> bingo hall. After three years of bingo use, the group of friends, now called the Friends of the Grand, with the support of Blackpool Borough Council, negotiated to lease and eventually buy the theatre back from EMI over a period of a few years. The purchase was complete by 1 October 1980 and a refurbishment, achieved partly through voluntary effort, was begun. Finally, on 23 March 1981 the Grand re-opened as a theatre once again to stage an Old Vic performance of <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Merchant_of_Venice.htm" title="The Merchant of Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a></i> featuring <a href="../../wp/t/Timothy_West.htm" title="Timothy West">Timothy West</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Prunella_Scales.htm" title="Prunella Scales">Prunella Scales</a>. The theatre's return was further confirmed in May of the same year when a <!--del_lnk--> Royal Variety Performance was staged in the presence of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles%252C_Prince_of_Wales.htm" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Prince Charles</a>.</p>
       <p>The town also plays host to the longest running seaside show in Britain, <!--del_lnk--> Legends, which features multiple tribute artistes with a live band and dance troupe, first appearing at the North Pier in 1999, then at the Central Pier from 2000 to 2012 and now at the Sands Venue, located in the Palatine buildings (formerly the Palace nightclub) on the promenade near Blackpool Tower.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Events_and_festivals">Events and festivals</span></h3>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Dance Festival is a world-famous annual <!--del_lnk--> ballroom dance competition of international significance as featured in the 1996 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Shall We Dance?</i></li>
        <li>For the last three years, Blackpool has played host to the Rebellion Festival, an annual event which moved back to Blackpool after a few years in nearby <!--del_lnk--> Morecambe.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Illuminations, consisting of a series of lighted displays and <!--del_lnk--> collages arranged along the entire length of the seafront, 7 miles (11&nbsp;km) in total, attract many visitors from late August to early November, a time when most British seaside resorts' holiday seasons have already ended. This results in major traffic jams as most people now view the lights from cars and coaches which crawl nose-to-tail along the whole length of the seafront, particularly at weekends and during school holidays. Each season a famous person "flicks the switch" to turn the lights on in an opening-night ceremony. In 2008 the BBC <i><!--del_lnk--> Top Gear</i> team had a race to see who could arrive first from <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> on a limited amount of fuel to activate the lights; <!--del_lnk--> James May, who was last, missed it.</li>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gay_Blackpool">Gay Blackpool</span></h3>
       <p>Blackpool is often described as the "gay capital of the North" (with <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> often being described as "the gay capital of the South"). Blackpool had its first <!--del_lnk--> gay pride celebration in 2006. Historically, seaside resorts have been able to provide niches for <!--del_lnk--> minority groups. Blackpool, like other English resorts, has had a reputation for being a safe community for gay people. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, there was a proliferation of caf&eacute;s, pubs and clubs where homosexual men could meet in Blackpool. In the 1990s, the town began to be promoted as a gay tourist destination. Blackpool contains several bars, pubs and nightclubs aimed at the LGBT community. These include <!--del_lnk--> Funny Girls (a <!--del_lnk--> burlesque <!--del_lnk--> cabaret showbar), Buzz, the Flamingo, the Flying Handbag, Roxy's, Mardi Gras, KAOS and Taboo/Lucys @ tabago. The local gay community is now also catered for by an online radio station &ndash; Blackpool Gay Radio &ndash; featuring a mix of music, local news, features and celebrity interviews.</p>

       <p>Blackpool is continually striving to improve its position within today's tourist industry. One controversial proposal, which had the involvement of the local council, was to transform Blackpool into a casino resort along the lines of the <!--del_lnk--> Las Vegas Strip and <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic City, making it the centre point of <!--del_lnk--> gambling in the UK. However, <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> was unexpectedly selected for the initial trial by the Government's Casinos Advisory Panel. Since this decision, Blackpool's council and MPs have lobbied Parliament extensively, claiming their bid was misunderstood. The local newspaper, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Gazette</i>, sent a petition signed by over 11,500 local residents and visitors demanding the decision be reconsidered. On 29 March 2007, the Advisory Panel's recommendations were approved by the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="House of Commons of the United Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, but rejected by the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>, meaning the bill would be reconsidered by parliament. However in early 2008 the House of Lords voted against the super-casino proposal, and the Government proceeded no further with the idea.</p>
       <p>The Talbot Gateway is a planned &pound;285m civic quarter, for which international project management specialist <!--del_lnk--> AMEC has been chosen to transform a currently rundown area around <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool North railway station into a what Blackpool Council hope will be a world-class gateway with new office and retail space as well as a public square, dubbed the Talbot Plaza. The development would be 'wrapped' around Blackpool North railway station so that rail passengers arrive at street level into the new plaza with views down onto the seafront, making their arrival into Blackpool a much more pleasant experience than at present. The regeneration company behind much of the towns current and future development, ReBlackpool, are working with Blackpool Council and AMEC to prepare a planning application.</p>
       <p>Regeneration work has recently been completed on Waterloo Road in South Shore that has transformed the area into a modern shopping centre. &pound;1 million of public investment is helping to improve the public realm and act as a catalyst for the regeneration of South Shore.</p>
       <p>In March 2010 it was confirmed that a deal had been made between Blackpool Council and Leisure Parcs to purchase some of Blackpool's most notable landmarks. The deal, totalling &pound;38.9m, had national and local government backing and included the purchase of:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Blackpool Tower</li>
        <li>The Winter Gardens</li>
        <li>The Sea Life Centre</li>
        <li>Louis Tussauds Wax Works</li>
        <li>The Blackpool Tower Dungeon</li>
        <li>Indoor Gold Centre</li>
        <li>Bonny Street Market</li>
        <li>Mr T's Amusement Arcade</li>
       </ul>
       <p>It was also announced that the Tower would be run by Merlin Entertainments Group (who run the <a href="../../wp/l/London_Eye.htm" title="London Eye">London Eye</a>) as well as it seeing a programme of repairs totalling &pound;10m, the first phase was scheduled to be complete for the 2011 season. Merlin Entertainments Group also took over the running of Louis Tussauds Wax Works, converting it into their bigger and better-known brand, Madame Tussauds Wax Works. The Winter Gardens were purchased by Blackpool Council; the complex is operated by Crown Entertainment Centres Ltd.</p>
       <p>Both the Northwest Development Agency (NWDA) and Blackpool's regeneration company ReBlackpool were crucial players in securing the deal.</p>

       <p>In 1927 the local council announced that an airfield would be built near Stanley Park, which would become <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Park Aerodrome offering flights to the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> for &pound;1-16s-0d (&pound;1.80). The airport opened in 1929 and was officially opened by then <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a> <!--del_lnk--> Ramsay MacDonald in 1931. However, with the opening of Squires Gate Airport a decision was announced in 1936 by the <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of Transport to close the Stanley Park airfield. In fact, civil operations continued until the outbreak of war with scheduled services to the Isle of Man and elsewhere. During the war, Stanley Park was used as a <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> training station, known as No. 3 School of Technical Training. <!--del_lnk--> Vickers assembled many <!--del_lnk--> Wellington bombers here and <!--del_lnk--> Beaufighters were repaired for the RAF. The airfield closed in 1947. The land on which the airport stood now covers <!--del_lnk--> Blackpool Zoo and a hotel and golf course. The <!--del_lnk--> hangars from the old airport are still in use as the elephant enclosure for the zoo.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Blackpool tramway runs from <!--del_lnk--> Starr Gate in Blackpool to <!--del_lnk--> Fleetwood and is the only surviving first-generation tramway in the United Kingdom. The tramway dates back to 1885 and is one of the oldest electric tramways in the world. It is run by Blackpool Transport, owned by Blackpool Council. The tramway runs for 11 miles (18&nbsp;km) and carries 6,500,000 passengers each year.</p>
       <p>The tramway was for a long time the only working tramway in the United Kingdom outside of museums. It was also the UK's first electric system. However there are now a number of other tramways, including <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Metrolink, <!--del_lnk--> South London Tramlink, <!--del_lnk--> Nottingham Express Transit and <!--del_lnk--> Sheffield Supertram.</p>
       <p>On 1 February 2008 it was announced that the <!--del_lnk--> Government had agreed to a joint Blackpool Transport and Blackpool Council bid for funding toward the total upgrade of the track. The government contributed &pound;60.3m of the total &pound;85.3m cost. Blackpool Council and Lancashire County Council each provided about &pound;12.5m. The Government's decision meant that the entire length of the tramway from Starr Gate to Fleetwood was be upgraded and also sixteen <!--del_lnk--> state-of-the-art trams replaced the older fleet</p>
       <p>In April 2012, the tramway reopened after the major reconstruction. Day to day services are run by the 16 <!--del_lnk--> Flexity 2 trams. Several double deck 'Balloon' trams from the older fleet have been widened to work with alongside the new trams to provide additional capacity in the summer months. Several non-modified older trams also operate a 'heritage' service from Pleasure Beach to Little Bispham on weekends and holidays.</p>

       <p>In 1913, the <!--del_lnk--> Brides in the bath serial killer <!--del_lnk--> George Joseph Smith drowned his second wife Alice in their rented room of a boarding house on Regent Road. He was due to be the beneficiary of a sizeable life insurance policy upon his wife's death.</p>
       <p>In 1971 Supt <!--del_lnk--> Gerry Richardson, 38, was shot dead while chasing a gang of London thugs who had robbed a resort jewellers. The five-man group bungled the raid on Preston's Jewellers in the Strand. They arrived late and failed to check a back room where the shop manager had already raised a silent alarm connected to Blackpool Police Station. As the gang made their getaway they became involved in a high-speed chase through the streets of North Shore which ended with Supt Richardson's tragic murder at the hands of "Fat" Freddie Sewell. Supt Richardson was posthumously awarded the <!--del_lnk--> George Cross in 1972. Wounded Inspector <!--del_lnk--> Carl Walker also received the George Cross.</p>
       <p>In 1999, Stuart Michael Diamond was convicted of the brutal murder of a homeless 17-year-old heroin addict, Christopher Hartley. Diamond murdered Hartley and dismembered his body before 'dumping' the remains in a hotel 'swill bin'; his head was never recovered.</p>
       <p>In 2007, the jury in the case of the alleged rape and murder of Blackpool schoolgirl Charlene Downes, 14, heard a police surveillance tape of <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordanian</a> Iyad Albattikhi, 29, and <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iranian</a> Mohammed Reveshi, 50, allegedly detailing her stabbing, and her later alleged disposal in their "Funny Boyz" kebab shop's mincing machine by the prosecution. Albattikhi allegedly boasted that he had sold her remains in kebabs. both men were acquitted of the alleged offence. John Bromley-Davenport, for the defence, said: "We have uncovered within the Blackpool Police force an astonishing catalogue of incompetence, failure to disclose, manipulation and lies, some of which were uttered on oath during the trial last year. If the jury at that trial had swallowed the lies and been duped by the manipulation then a grave miscarriage of justice would have occurred."</p>
       <p>On 25 July 2010, a nurse named Jane Clough was stabbed to death in <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Hospital's car park. Her ex-boyfriend Jonathan Vass, a paramedic, was later found guilty of her murder.</p>
