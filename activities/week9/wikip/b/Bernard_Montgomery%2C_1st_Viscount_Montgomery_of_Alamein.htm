       <p>He saw action in the First World War, where he was seriously wounded, and during the Second World War he commanded the <!--del_lnk--> Eighth Army from August 1942 in the <!--del_lnk--> Western Desert until the final Allied victory in Tunisia. This command included the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of El Alamein, a turning point in the <!--del_lnk--> Western Desert Campaign. He subsequently commanded the Eighth Army in Sicily and <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> before being given responsibility for planning the D-Day invasion in Normandy. He was in command of all Allied ground forces during <!--del_lnk--> Operation Overlord from the initial landings until after the <a href="../../wp/i/Invasion_of_Normandy.htm" title="Invasion of Normandy">Battle of Normandy</a>. He then continued in command of the <!--del_lnk--> 21st Army Group for the rest of the campaign in North West Europe. As such he was the principal field commander for <!--del_lnk--> the failed airborne attempt to bridge the Rhine at <!--del_lnk--> Arnhem and the <!--del_lnk--> Allied Rhine crossing. On 4 May 1945 he took the German surrender at <!--del_lnk--> Luneburg Heath in northern Germany. After the war he became Commander-in-Chief of the <!--del_lnk--> British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in Germany and then <!--del_lnk--> Chief of the Imperial General Staff.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
       <p>Montgomery was born in <!--del_lnk--> Kennington, London, in 1887, the fourth child of nine, to an <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Irish <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> priest, the <!--del_lnk--> Reverend <!--del_lnk--> Henry Montgomery, and his wife, Maud (n&eacute;e Farrar). Henry Montgomery, Vicar of St Mark's, Kennington, at that time, was the second son of the noted <!--del_lnk--> Indian administrator, <!--del_lnk--> Sir Robert Montgomery, who died a month after Bernard's birth. He was probably a descendant of <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Montgomery (1686&ndash;1729). Bernard's mother, Maud, was the daughter of the well-known preacher <!--del_lnk--> Frederic William Farrar, and was eighteen years younger than her husband. After the death of Sir Robert Montgomery, Henry inherited the Montgomery ancestral estate of New Park at <!--del_lnk--> Moville in northern <!--del_lnk--> County Donegal. However, there was still &pound;13,000 to pay on a <!--del_lnk--> mortgage, a fairly large amount of money in the 1880s, and Henry was at the time still only a mere parish priest. Despite selling off all of those farms that were at Ballynally, "there was barely enough to keep up New Park and pay for the blasted summer holiday" (i.e., at New Park). It was a financial relief of some magnitude when, in 1889, Henry was made <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Tasmania, then still a British colony. He considered it his duty to spend as much time as possible in the outlying country of Tasmania and was away six months at a time. While he was away his wife, still in her mid-twenties, gave her children "constant" beatings, then ignored them most of the time as she performed the public duties of the bishop's wife. Of Bernard's siblings, Sibyl died prematurely in Tasmania, and Harold, Donald and Una all emigrated. Maud Montgomery took little active interest in the education of her young children other than to have them taught by tutors brought from England. The loveless environment made Bernard something of a bully, as he himself later recalled "I was a dreadful little boy. I don't suppose anybody would put up with my sort of behaviour these days." Later in life Montgomery refused to allow his son <!--del_lnk--> David to have anything to do with his grandmother and he refused to attend her funeral in 1949.</p>
       <p>The family returned home once for the <!--del_lnk--> Lambeth Conference in 1897, and Bernard and his brother Harold were educated for a term at <!--del_lnk--> The King's School, Canterbury. In 1901, Bishop Montgomery became secretary of the <!--del_lnk--> Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the family returned to London. Montgomery attended <!--del_lnk--> St Paul's School and then the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from which he was almost expelled for rowdiness and violence. On graduation he joined the 1st Battalion, <!--del_lnk--> The Royal Warwickshire Regiment in September 1908 as a second lieutenant, and first saw service later that year in <!--del_lnk--> India. He was promoted to <!--del_lnk--> lieutenant in 1910. He became adjutant of the 1st Battalion of his regiment at <!--del_lnk--> Shorncliffe in 1912.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The First World War began in August 1914 and Montgomery moved to France with his regiment that month. He saw action at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Le Cateau that month and during the retreat from <!--del_lnk--> Mons. At <!--del_lnk--> M&eacute;teren, near the Belgian border at <!--del_lnk--> Bailleul on 13 October 1914, during an Allied counter-offensive, he was shot through the right <!--del_lnk--> lung by a sniper. Montgomery was hit once more though, in the knee. He was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Distinguished Service Order for gallant leadership: the citation for this award, published in the <i><!--del_lnk--> London Gazette</i> in December 1914 reads:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">Conspicuous gallant leading on 13th October, when he turned the enemy out of their trenches with the bayonet. He was severely wounded.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>After recovering in early 1915, he was appointed to be <!--del_lnk--> brigade major first of <!--del_lnk--> 112th Brigade and then with <!--del_lnk--> 104th Brigade under training in <!--del_lnk--> Lancashire. He returned to the Western Front in early 1916 as a general staff officer in the <!--del_lnk--> 33rd Division and took part in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Arras in April / May 1917. He became a general staff officer with <!--del_lnk--> IX Corps, part of General Sir <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Plumer's Second Army, in July 1917.</p>
       <p>Montgomery served at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Passchendaele in Autumn 1917 before finishing the war as General Staff Officer 1 and effectively chief of staff of the <!--del_lnk--> 47th (2nd London) Division, with the temporary rank of <!--del_lnk--> lieutenant-colonel. A photograph from October 1918, reproduced in many biographies, shows the then unknown Lt.-Col. Montgomery standing in front of <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> (Minister of Munitions) at the parade following the liberation of <a href="../../wp/l/Lille.htm" title="Lille">Lille</a>.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Between_the_wars">Between the wars</span></h2>
       <p>After the First World War Montgomery commanded the 17th Battalion the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Fusiliers, a battalion in the <!--del_lnk--> British Army of the Rhine, before reverting to his substantive rank of <!--del_lnk--> captain (brevet major) in November 1919. He then attended the army's <!--del_lnk--> Staff College, Camberley, before being appointed <!--del_lnk--> Brigade Major in the 17th Infantry Brigade in January 1921. The brigade was stationed in <!--del_lnk--> County Cork carrying out counter-insurgency operations during the final stages of the <!--del_lnk--> Irish War of Independence. Montgomery came to the conclusion that the conflict could not be won without harsh measures, and that self-government was the only feasible solution; in 1923, after the establishment of the <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_Free_State.htm" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a> and during the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Civil War, Montgomery wrote to Colonel <a href="../../wp/a/Arthur_Percival.htm" title="Arthur Percival">Arthur Percival</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Essex Regiment:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">Personally, my whole attention was given to defeating the rebels but it never bothered me a bit how many houses were burnt. I think I regarded all civilians as 'Shinners' and I never had any dealings with any of them. My own view is that to win a war of this sort, you must be ruthless. <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>, or the Germans, would have settled it in a very short time. Nowadays public opinion precludes such methods, the nation would never allow it, and the politicians would lose their jobs if they sanctioned it. That being so, I consider that <!--del_lnk--> Lloyd George was right in what he did, if we had gone on we could probably have squashed the rebellion as a temporary measure, but it would have broken out again like an ulcer the moment we removed the troops. I think the rebels would probably [have] refused battles, and hidden their arms etc. until we had gone.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In May 1923, Montgomery was posted to the <!--del_lnk--> Territorial <!--del_lnk--> 49th Division. He returned to the 1st Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1925 as a company commander. In January 1926 having been promoted to major in 1925, he was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant General at the <!--del_lnk--> Staff College, Camberley in the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel, a position he held until January 1929 by which time he had been made a (<!--del_lnk--> brevet lieutenant-colonel).</p>
       <p>In 1927, he met and married <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Carver, n&eacute;e Hobart, widow of <!--del_lnk--> Oswald Carver, Olympic rowing medalist who was killed in the First World War. Their son, <!--del_lnk--> David, was born in August 1928. Elizabeth Carver was the sister of the Second World War commander <!--del_lnk--> Percy Hobart.</p>
       <p>He returned to 1st Royal Warwickshire Regiment again, as Commander of Headquarters Company in January 1929 and went to the War Office to help write the Infantry Training Manual in Summer 1929. In 1931 Montgomery became lieutenant-colonel commanding the 1st Battalion of <!--del_lnk--> The Royal Warwickshire Regiment and saw service in <!--del_lnk--> Palestine and <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. He was promoted to full colonel in 1934. He attended and was then recommended to become an instructor at the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Army <!--del_lnk--> Staff College (now the <!--del_lnk--> Pakistan Army Staff College) in <!--del_lnk--> Quetta, British India.</p>
       <p>On completion of his tour of duty in India, Montgomery returned to Britain in June 1937 where he became commanding officer of the 9th Infantry Brigade with the temporary rank of <!--del_lnk--> brigadier, but that year saw great tragedy when his wife was bitten by an insect while on holiday in <!--del_lnk--> Burnham-on-Sea. The bite became infected, and his wife died in his arms from <!--del_lnk--> septicaemia following an <!--del_lnk--> amputation. The loss devastated Montgomery, but he insisted on throwing himself back into his work immediately after the funeral. In 1938, he organised an amphibious combined operations landing exercise that impressed the new <!--del_lnk--> commander-in-chief, <!--del_lnk--> Southern Command, General <!--del_lnk--> Wavell. He was promoted to major-general in October 1938 and took command of the <!--del_lnk--> 8th Infantry Division in Palestine. There he quashed an Arab revolt before returning in July 1939 to Britain, suffering a serious illness on the way, to command the <!--del_lnk--> 3rd (Iron) Infantry Division. On hearing of the rebel defeat in April 1939, Montgomery said, "I shall be sorry to leave Palestine in many ways, as I have enjoyed the war out here".</p>

       <p>Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. The 3rd Division was deployed to Belgium as part of the <!--del_lnk--> British Expeditionary Force (BEF). During this time, Montgomery faced serious trouble from his military superiors and the clergy for his frank attitude regarding the sexual health of his soldiers, but was defended from dismissal by his superior <!--del_lnk--> Alan Brooke, commander of <!--del_lnk--> II Corps. Montgomery's training paid off when the Germans began their invasion of the <!--del_lnk--> Low Countries on 10 May 1940 and the 3rd Division advanced to the River <!--del_lnk--> Dijle and then withdrew to <!--del_lnk--> Dunkirk with great professionalism, entering the Dunkirk perimeter in a famous night-time march which placed his forces on the left flank which had been left exposed by the Belgian surrender. The 3rd Division returned to Britain intact with minimal casualties. During <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Dunkirk_evacuation.htm" title="Operation Dynamo">Operation Dynamo</a> &mdash; the evacuation of 330,000 BEF and French troops to Britain &mdash; Montgomery assumed command of the <!--del_lnk--> II Corps.</p>
       <p>On his return Montgomery antagonised the <!--del_lnk--> War Office with trenchant criticisms of the command of the BEF and was briefly relegated to divisional command. He was however made a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Order_of_the_Bath.htm" title="Companion of the Order of the Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a>. In July 1940, he was appointed acting <!--del_lnk--> lieutenant-general, placed in command of <!--del_lnk--> V Corps, responsible for the defence of <a href="../../wp/h/Hampshire.htm" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Dorset.htm" title="Dorset">Dorset</a>, and started a long-running feud with the new commander-in-chief, Southern Command, <!--del_lnk--> Claude Auchinleck. In April 1941, he became commander of <!--del_lnk--> XII Corps responsible for the defence of <!--del_lnk--> Kent. During this period he instituted a regime of continuous training and insisted on high levels of physical fitness for both officers and other ranks. He was ruthless in sacking officers he considered would be unfit for command in action. In December 1941 Montgomery was given command of <!--del_lnk--> South-Eastern Command overseeing the defence of Kent, <!--del_lnk--> Sussex and <!--del_lnk--> Surrey. He renamed his command the South-Eastern Army to promote offensive spirit. During this time he further developed and rehearsed his ideas and trained his soldiers, culminating in <!--del_lnk--> Exercise Tiger in May 1942, a combined forces <!--del_lnk--> exercise involving 100,000 troops.</p>

       <p>In 1942, a new field commander was required in the Middle East, where Auchinleck was fulfilling both the role of commander-in-chief <!--del_lnk--> Middle East Command and commander <!--del_lnk--> Eighth Army. He had stabilised the Allied position at the <!--del_lnk--> First Battle of El Alamein, but after a visit in August 1942, the Prime Minister, <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, replaced him as C-in-C with <!--del_lnk--> Alexander and <!--del_lnk--> William Gott as commander of the Eighth Army in the <!--del_lnk--> Western Desert. After Gott was killed flying back to <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> Churchill was persuaded by Brooke, who by this time was <!--del_lnk--> Chief of the Imperial General Staff, to appoint Montgomery, who had only just been nominated to replace Alexander as commander of the British ground forces for <!--del_lnk--> Operation Torch.</p>
       <p>A story, probably apocryphal but popular at the time, is that the appointment caused Montgomery to remark that "After having an easy war, things have now got much more difficult." A colleague is supposed to have told him to cheer up &ndash; at which point Montgomery is supposed to have said "I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about Rommel!"</p>
       <p>Montgomery's assumption of command transformed the fighting spirit and abilities of the Eighth Army. Taking command on 13 August 1942, he immediately became a whirlwind of activity. He ordered the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> X Corps, which contained all armoured divisions to fight alongside his <!--del_lnk--> XXX Corps which was all infantry divisions. This was in no way similar to a German Panzer Corps. One of Rommel's Panzer Corps combined infantry, armour and artillery units under one corps commander. The only common commander for Montgomery's all infantry and all armour corps was the Eighth Army Commander himself. <!--del_lnk--> Correlli Barnett commented that Montgomery's solution "...&nbsp;was in every way opposite to Auchinleck's and in every way wrong, for it carried the existing dangerous separatism still further." Montgomery reinforced the 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) long front line at El Alamein, something that would take two months to accomplish. He asked Alexander to send him two new British divisions (51st Highland and 44th) that were then arriving in Egypt and were scheduled to be deployed in defence of the Nile Delta. He moved his field HQ to Burg al Arab, close to the Air Force command post in order better to coordinate combined operations. Montgomery was determined that the Army, Navy and Air Forces should fight their battles in a unified, focused manner according to a detailed plan. He ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa, just behind his own lines, expecting the German commander, <a href="../../wp/e/Erwin_Rommel.htm" title="Erwin Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>, to attack with the heights as his objective, something that Rommel soon did. Montgomery ordered all contingency plans for retreat to be destroyed. "I have cancelled the plan for withdrawal", he told his officers at the first meeting he held with them in the desert. "If we are attacked, then there will be no retreat. If we cannot stay here alive, then we will stay here dead."</p>
       <p>Montgomery made a great effort to appear before troops as often as possible, frequently visiting various units and making himself known to the men, often arranging for cigarettes to be distributed. Although he still wore a standard British officer's cap on arrival in the desert, he briefly wore an Australian broad-brimmed hat before switching to wearing the black beret (with the badge of the Royal Tank Regiment next to the British General Officer's badge) for which he became notable. The black beret had been offered to him by a soldier upon climbing into a tank to get a closer look at the front lines. Both Brooke and Alexander were astonished by the transformation in atmosphere when they visited on 19 August, less than a week after Montgomery had taken command.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="First_battles_with_Rommel">First battles with Rommel</span></h4>
       <p>Rommel attempted to turn the left flank of the Eighth Army at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Alam Halfa from 31 August 1942. The German/Italian armoured Corps infantry attack was stopped in very heavy fighting. Rommel's forces had to withdraw urgently lest their retreat through the British minefields be cut off. Montgomery was criticised for not counter-attacking the retreating forces immediately, but he felt strongly that his methodical build-up of British forces was not yet ready. A hasty counter-attack risked ruining his strategy for an offensive on his own terms in late October, planning for which had begun soon after he took command. He was confirmed in the permanent rank of lieutenant-general in mid October. The conquest of Libya was essential for airfields to support <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a> and to threaten the rear of Axis forces opposing <!--del_lnk--> Operation Torch. Montgomery prepared meticulously for the new offensive after convincing Churchill that the time was not being wasted. (Churchill sent a telegram to Alexander on 23 September 1942 which began, "We are in your hands and of course a victorious battle makes amends for much delay.") He was determined not to fight until he thought there had been sufficient preparation for a decisive victory, and put into action his beliefs with the gathering of resources, detailed planning, the training of troops&mdash;especially in clearing minefields and fighting at night&mdash;and in the use of 252 of the latest American-built <!--del_lnk--> Sherman tanks, 90 <!--del_lnk--> M7 Priest self-propelled howitzers, and making a personal visit to every unit involved in the offensive. By the time the offensive was ready in late October, Eighth Army had 231,000 men on its ration strength.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Second Battle of El Alamein began on 23 October 1942, and ended 12 days later with the first large-scale, decisive Allied land victory of the war. Montgomery correctly predicted both the length of the battle and the number of casualties (13,500). However, soon after Allied armoured units and infantry broke through the German and Italian lines and were pursuing the enemy forces at speed along the coast road, a violent rainstorm burst over the region, bogging down the tanks and support trucks in the desert mud. Montgomery, standing before his officers at headquarters and close to tears, announced that he was forced to call off the pursuit. Corelli Barnett has pointed out that the rain also fell on the Germans, and that the weather is therefore an inadequate explanation for the failure to exploit the breakthrough, but nevertheless the Battle of El Alamein had been a great success. Over 30,000 prisoners were taken including the German second in command, <!--del_lnk--> General von Thoma, as well as eight other general officers. Rommel, having been in a hospital in Germany at the start of the battle, was forced to return on 25 October 1942 after <!--del_lnk--> General Stumme &ndash; his replacement as German commander &ndash; died of a heart attack in the early hours of the battle.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tunisia">Tunisia</span></h4>
       <p>Montgomery was <a href="../../wp/o/Order_of_the_Bath.htm" title="Order of the Bath">knighted</a> and promoted to full <!--del_lnk--> general. He kept the initiative, applying superior strength when it suited him, forcing Rommel out of each successive defensive position. On 6 March 1943, Rommel's attack on the over-extended Eighth Army at <!--del_lnk--> Medenine (<!--del_lnk--> Operation Capri) with the largest concentration of German armour in North Africa was successfully repulsed. At the <!--del_lnk--> Mareth Line, 20 to 27 March, when Montgomery encountered fiercer frontal opposition than he had anticipated, he switched his major effort into an outflanking inland pincer, backed by low-flying <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a> fighter-bomber support. For his role in North Africa he was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Legion of Merit by the United States government in the rank of Chief Commander.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Sicily">Sicily</span></h4>
       <p>The next major Allied attack was the <!--del_lnk--> Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). Montgomery considered the initial plans for the Allied invasion, which had been agreed in principle by Eisenhower and Alexander, to be unworkable because of the dispersion of effort. He managed to have the plans recast to concentrate the Allied forces, having Patton's Seventh US Army land in the Gulf of Gela (on the left flank of Eighth Army, which landed around Syracuse in the south-east of Sicily) rather than near Palermo in the west and north of Sicily. Inter-Allied tensions grew as the American commanders <!--del_lnk--> Patton and <!--del_lnk--> Bradley (then commanding II US Corps under Patton), took umbrage at what they perceived as Montgomery's attitudes and boastfulness.</p>

       <p>During the autumn of 1943, Montgomery continued to command the Eighth Army during the <!--del_lnk--> landings on the mainland of Italy itself. In conjunction with the Anglo-American landings at Salerno (near Naples) by <!--del_lnk--> Mark Clark's <!--del_lnk--> Fifth Army and seaborne landings by British paratroops in the heel of Italy (including the key port of Taranto, where they disembarked without resistance directly into the port), Montgomery led the Eighth Army up the toe of Italy. Montgomery abhorred the lack of coordination, the dispersion of effort, and the strategic muddle and opportunism he perceived in the Allied effort in Italy and was glad to leave the "dog's breakfast" on 23 December 1943.</p>

       <p>Montgomery returned to Britain in January 1944 to take command of the <!--del_lnk--> 21st Army Group which consisted of all Allied ground forces that would take part in <!--del_lnk--> Operation Overlord, the invasion of <!--del_lnk--> Normandy. At <!--del_lnk--> St Paul's School on 7 April and 15 May he presented his strategy for the invasion. He envisaged a ninety day battle, ending when all the forces reached the <!--del_lnk--> Seine, pivoting on an Allied-held <!--del_lnk--> Caen, with British and Canadian armies forming a shoulder and the US armies wheeling on the right.</p>
       <p>During the hard fought two and a half month <a href="../../wp/i/Invasion_of_Normandy.htm" title="Invasion of Normandy">Battle of Normandy</a> that followed, the impact of a series of unfavourable autumnal weather conditions disrupted the Normandy landing areas. Montgomery's initial plan was to break out immediately towards <!--del_lnk--> Caen. Unable to do so, as the British did not get enough forces ashore to exploit the successful landing, Montgomery's advance was checked. When it appeared unlikely that the British Second Army would break out, Montgomery's contingency was designed to attract German forces to the British sector to ease the passing of United States Army through German defences to the west, during <!--del_lnk--> Operation Cobra. This series of battle plans by the British, Canadian and American armies trapped and defeated the German forces in Normandy in the <!--del_lnk--> Falaise pocket. The campaign that Montgomery fought was essentially <!--del_lnk--> attritional until the middle of July with the occupation of the <!--del_lnk--> Cotentin Peninsula and a series of offensives in the east, which secured Caen and attracted the bulk of German armour there. An American break-out was achieved with Operation Cobra and the encirclement of German forces in the <!--del_lnk--> Falaise pocket at the cost of British sacrifice with the diversionary <!--del_lnk--> Operation Goodwood.</p>

       <p>The increasing preponderance of American troops in the European theatre (from five out of ten divisions at <!--del_lnk--> D-Day to 72 out of 85 in 1945) made it a political impossibility for the Ground Forces Commander to be British. After the end of the Normandy campaign, <a href="../../wp/d/Dwight_D._Eisenhower.htm" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">General Eisenhower</a> himself took over Ground Forces Command on 1 September, while continuing as Supreme Commander, with Montgomery continuing to command the 21st Army Group, now consisting mainly of British and Canadian units. Montgomery bitterly resented this change, although it had been agreed before the D-Day invasion. <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> had Montgomery promoted to <!--del_lnk--> field marshal by way of compensation.</p>
       <p>Montgomery was able to persuade Eisenhower to adopt his strategy of a single thrust to the <!--del_lnk--> Ruhr with <!--del_lnk--> Operation Market Garden in September 1944. It was uncharacteristic of Montgomery's battles: the offensive was strategically bold, but poorly planned. Montgomery either did not receive or ignored <!--del_lnk--> ULTRA intelligence which warned of the presence of German armoured units near the site of the attack.</p>
       <p>When the surprise attack on the Ardennes took place on 16 December 1944, starting the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_the_Bulge.htm" title="Battle of the Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>, the front of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. 12th Army Group was split, with the bulk of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. First Army being on the northern shoulder of the German 'bulge'. The Army Group commander, General <!--del_lnk--> Omar Bradley, was located south of the penetration at <a href="../../wp/l/Luxembourg.htm" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> and command of the U.S. First Army became problematic. Montgomery was the nearest commander on the ground and on 20 December, Eisenhower (who was in <!--del_lnk--> Versailles) transferred <!--del_lnk--> Courtney Hodges' U.S. First Army and <!--del_lnk--> William Simpson's <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Ninth Army to his 21st Army Group, despite Bradley's vehement objections on national grounds. Montgomery grasped the situation quickly, visiting all divisional, corps, and army field commanders himself and instituting his '<!--del_lnk--> Phantom' network of liaison officers. He grouped the <!--del_lnk--> British XXX Corps as a strategic reserve behind the Meuse and reorganised the US defence of the northern shoulder, shortening and strengthening the line and ordering the evacuation of <!--del_lnk--> St Vith. The German commander of the 5th Panzer Army, <!--del_lnk--> Hasso von Manteuffel said:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>The operations of the American 1st Army had developed into a series of individual holding actions. Montgomery's contribution to restoring the situation was that he turned a series of isolated actions into a coherent battle fought according to a clear and definite plan. It was his refusal to engage in premature and piecemeal counter-attacks which enabled the Americans to gather their reserves and frustrate the German attempts to extend their breakthrough.</p>

       <p>After the war Montgomery became the C-in-C of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), the name given to the British Occupation Forces and the British member of the Allied Control Council. He was created 1st <!--del_lnk--> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein in 1946. He was <!--del_lnk--> Chief of the Imperial General Staff from 1946 until 1948, succeeding Alanbrooke, but was largely a failure as it required strategic and political skills he did not possess. He was barely on speaking terms with his fellow chiefs, sending his VCIGS to attend their meetings and he clashed particularly with <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Tedder, who as Deputy Supreme Commander had intrigued for Montgomery's dismissal during the Battle of Normandy, and who was by now <!--del_lnk--> Chief of the Air Staff. When Montgomery's term of office expired, Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Clement Attlee appointed General (later Field-Marshal) <!--del_lnk--> William Slim as his successor; when Montgomery protested that he had told his prot&eacute;g&eacute; <!--del_lnk--> John Crocker, a former corps commander from the 1944-5 campaign, that the job was to be his, Attlee is said to have given the memorable retort "Untell him".</p>
       <p>He was then appointed Chairman of the <!--del_lnk--> Western European Union's commanders-in-chief committee. Volume 3 of Nigel Hamilton's <i>Life of Montgomery of Alamein</i> gives a good account of the bickering between Montgomery and his land forces chief, a French general, which created splits through the Union headquarters. He was thus pleased to become Eisenhower's deputy in creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's <!--del_lnk--> European forces in 1951. He was an effective inspector-general and mounted good exercises, but out of his depth politically. He continued to serve under Eisenhower's successors, <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Ridgway and <!--del_lnk--> Al Gruenther, until his retirement, aged nearly 71, in 1958. His mother died in 1949; Montgomery did not attend the funeral, claiming he was "too busy".</p>
       <p>He was chairman of the governing body of <!--del_lnk--> St. John's School, Leatherhead from 1951 to 1966, and a generous supporter. Montgomery was an Honorary Member of the <!--del_lnk--> Winkle Club, a noted charity in Hastings, East Sussex, and introduced <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> to the club in 1955.</p>

       <p>In 1953, the Hamilton Board of Education in <!--del_lnk--> Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, wrote to Montgomery and asked permission to name a new school in the city's east end after him. Viscount Montgomery Elementary was billed as "the most modern school in North America" and the largest single-storey school in Hamilton, when the sod was turned on 14 March 1951. The school officially opened on 18 April 1953, with Montgomery in attendance among almost 10,000 well-wishers. At the opening, he gave the motto "Gardez Bien" from his own family's <!--del_lnk--> coat of arms. Montgomery referred to the school as his "beloved school" and visited on five separate occasions, the last being in 1960. On his last visit, he said to "his" students:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>Let's make Viscount Montgomery School the best in Hamilton, the best in Ontario, the best in Canada. I don't associate myself with anything that is not good. It is up to you to see that everything about this school is good. It is up to the students to not only be their best in school but in their behaviour outside of Viscount. Education is not just something that will help you pass your exams and get you a job, it is to develop your brain to teach you to marshal facts and do things.</p>

       <p>Montgomery's memoirs (1958) criticised many of his wartime comrades in harsh terms, including Eisenhower, whom he accused, among other things, of prolonging the war by a year through poor leadership &mdash; allegations which ended their friendship, not least as Eisenhower was still US President at the time. He was threatened with legal action by Field-Marshal Auchinleck for suggesting that Auchinleck had intended to retreat from the Alamein position if attacked again, and had to give a radio broadcast (20 November 1958) expressing his gratitude to Auchinleck for having stabilised the front at the First Battle of Alamein. The 1960 paperback edition of his memoirs contains a publisher's note drawing attention to that broadcast, and stating that in the publisher's view the reader might reasonably assume from Montgomery's text that Auchinleck had been planning to retreat "into the Nile Delta or beyond" and pointing out that it had been Auchinleck's intention to launch an offensive as soon as Eighth Army was "rested and regrouped". Montgomery was stripped of his honorary citizenship of <!--del_lnk--> Montgomery, Alabama, and was challenged to a duel by an Italian officer.</p>
       <p>In retirement he publicly supported <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Apartheid_in_South_Africa.htm" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> after a visit to South Africa in 1962, outraging much British liberal opinion, and after a visit to China declared himself impressed by the Chinese leadership. He spoke out against the legalisation of homosexuality in the United Kingdom, arguing that the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sexual Offences Act 1967</i> was a "charter for buggery" and that "this sort of thing may be tolerated by the French, but we're British &ndash; thank God." Biographer Nigel Hamilton has suggested Montgomery may have been a repressed homosexual; in the late 1940s Montgomery maintained an affectionate friendship with a 12-year-old Swiss boy. One biographer called the friendship "bizarre", although not "improper", and a sign of "pitiful loneliness."</p>
       <p>He twice met with <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israeli</a> general <!--del_lnk--> Moshe Dayan. After an initial meeting in the early 1950s, Montgomery met Dayan again in the 1960s to discuss the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, which Dayan was studying. Montgomery was harshly critical of US strategy in Vietnam, which involved deploying large numbers of combat troops, aggressive bombing attacks, and uprooting entire village populations and forcing them into <!--del_lnk--> strategic hamlets. Montgomery said that the Americans' most important problem was that they had no clear-cut objective, and allowed local commanders to set military policy. At the end of their meeting, Montgomery asked Dayan to tell the Americans, in his name, that they were "insane".</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Death">Death</span></h2>
       <p>Montgomery died from unspecified causes in 1976 at his home Isington Mill, <!--del_lnk--> Isington near <!--del_lnk--> Alton, Hampshire, aged 88. After a funeral ceremony at <!--del_lnk--> St George's Chapel, Windsor, he was interred in the Holy Cross Churchyard, <!--del_lnk--> Binsted.  Every year a remembrance service is held at his grave, which includes veterans of Normandy, and a bugler playing the Last Post.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Imperial War Museum holds a variety of material relating to Montgomery in its collections. These include Montgomery's <!--del_lnk--> Grant command tank (on display in the atrium at the Museum's London branch), his command caravans as used in North West Europe (on display at IWM Duxford), and his papers are held by the Museum's Department of Documents. The Museum maintains a permanent exhibition about Montgomery, entitled <i>Monty: Master of the Battlefield</i>.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Field Marshal Montgomery Pipe Band from <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> is named after him.</p>
       <p>His Rolls Royce staff car is on display at the Royal Logistic Corps Museum, Deepcut, Surrey.</p>
       <p>The Montgomery cocktail is a <!--del_lnk--> martini mixed at a ratio of 15:1, facetiously named that because Montgomery supposedly refused to go into battle unless his numerical advantage was at least that high. Ironically, following severe internal injuries received in the First World War, Montgomery himself could neither smoke nor drink.</p>
       <p>In the 1998 documentary <i>Live At Aspen</i> during the <!--del_lnk--> US Comedy Arts Festival, the British comedy troupe <i><!--del_lnk--> Monty Python's Flying Circus</i> explained how they came up with their name, saying that the name Monty "...&nbsp;made us laugh because Monty to us means Lord Montgomery, our great general of the Second World War".</p>
