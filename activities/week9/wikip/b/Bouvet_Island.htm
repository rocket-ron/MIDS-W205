       <p><b>Bouvet Island</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Norwegian: <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>Bouvet&oslash;ya</i></span>, also historically known as <b>Liverpool Island</b> or <b>Lindsay Island</b>) is an uninhabited <!--del_lnk--> sub-antarctic volcanic <!--del_lnk--> island in the South <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, south-southwest of the <!--del_lnk--> Cape of Good Hope (<a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>). It is a <!--del_lnk--> dependent area of <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> and is not subject to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Antarctic_Treaty_System.htm" title="Antarctic Treaty">Antarctic Treaty</a>.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geography">Geography</span></h2>
       <p>Bouvet Island is located at <span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><!--del_lnk--> <span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">54&deg;26&prime;S</span> <span class="longitude">3&deg;24&prime;E</span></span></span></span>. It is 49&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km&sup2; in area, 93% of which is covered by <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glaciers</a> which block the south and east coasts.</p>
       <p>Bouvet Island is <!--del_lnk--> the most remote island in the world. The nearest land is <!--del_lnk--> Queen Maud Land, <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, over 1,600&nbsp;km (1,000&nbsp;miles) away to the south, which is itself uninhabited.</p>
       <p>It has no ports or harbours, only offshore anchorages, and is therefore difficult to approach. The waves have created a very steep coast. The easiest way to access the island is with a helicopter from a ship. The glaciers form a thick ice layer falling in high cliffs into the sea or onto the black beaches of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcanic">volcanic</a> sand. The 29.6&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km (18.4&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> miles) of coastline are often surrounded by an ice pack. The highest point on the island is called <i>Olavtoppen</i>, whose peak is 780&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m (2,559&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft) above sea level. A <a href="../../wp/l/Lava.htm" title="Lava">lava</a> shelf on the island's west coast, which appeared between <a href="../../wp/1/1955.htm" title="1955">1955</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/1958.htm" title="1958">1958</a>, provides a nesting site for birds.</p>
       <p>Because of the harsh climate and ice-bound terrain, vegetation is limited to lichens and mosses. Seals, seabirds and penguins are the only fauna.</p>
       <p>Despite being uninhabited, Bouvet Island has the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> <!--del_lnk--> country code <!--del_lnk--> top-level domain (<!--del_lnk--> ccTLD) <!--del_lnk--> .bv, though it is not used. A handful of <!--del_lnk--> amateur radio expeditions have gone to this remote location (<!--del_lnk--> call signs used here begin with <i>3Y</i>). There is no telephone country code or <!--del_lnk--> area code, and no telephone connection (except by satellite, but there is nothing installed). There is no <!--del_lnk--> postal code and no postal distribution. Ships approaching the Bouvet Island fall within the UTC Z <a href="../../wp/t/Time_zone.htm" title="Time zone">time zone</a>. There is a Norwegian law saying that the time zone of Norwegian territory is UTC+1, except for a part of year (daylight saving time) . This means that the legal time zone is UTC+1 for the Bouvet Island, like <a href="../../wp/j/Jan_Mayen.htm" title="Jan Mayen">Jan Mayen</a> which is located in the UTC-1 nautical time zone, but also has UTC+1.</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>Bouvet Island was discovered on <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1739, by <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier, who commanded the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> ships <i>Aigle</i> and <i>Marie</i>. However, the island's position was not accurately fixed having been placed eight degrees to the east, and Bouvet did not circumnavigate his discovery, so it remained unclear whether it was an island or part of a continent.</p>
       <p>In 1772, Captain <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> left South Africa on a mission to find the island. However, when arriving at 54&deg;S, 11&deg;E where Bouvet had said he sighted the island, nothing was to be seen. Captain Cook assumed that Bouvet had taken an iceberg for an island, and he abandoned the search. </p>
       <p>The island was not sighted again until <a href="../../wp/1/1808.htm" title="1808">1808</a>, when it was spotted by James Lindsay, the captain of the <!--del_lnk--> Enderby Company <!--del_lnk--> whaler <i>Snow Swan</i>. Though he didn't land, he was the first to correctly fix the island's position. During this time the island was sometimes referred to as Lindsay Island, though it was not then completely certain that it was the same island as Bouvet had sighted.</p>
       <p>The first successful landfall dates to December <a href="../../wp/1/1822.htm" title="1822">1822</a>, when Captain <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Morrell of the sealer <i>Wasp</i> landed, hunting for <!--del_lnk--> seals. He took several seal skins.</p>
       <p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 10, <a href="../../wp/1/1825.htm" title="1825">1825</a>, Captain Norris, master of the Enderby Company whalers <i>Sprightly</i> and <i>Lively</i>, landed on the island, named it <i>Liverpool Island</i>, and claimed it for the <!--del_lnk--> British Crown. Again, it was not known with certainty at the time that this was the same island found previously. He also reported sighting a second island nearby, which he named <!--del_lnk--> Thompson Island. No trace of this island now remains.</p>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/1/1898.htm" title="1898">1898</a>, the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> <i>Valdivia</i> expedition of <!--del_lnk--> Carl Chun visited the island but did not land.</p>
       <p>The first extended stay on the island was in <a href="../../wp/1/1927.htm" title="1927">1927</a>, when the <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> "Norvegia" crew stayed for about a month; this is the basis for the claim by "Norvegia" expedition leader <!--del_lnk--> Lars Christensen on behalf of <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>, who have named the island Bouvet Island (Bouvet&oslash;ya in Norwegian). The island was <!--del_lnk--> annexed on <!--del_lnk--> December 1 <a href="../../wp/1/1927.htm" title="1927">1927</a>, and by a Royal Norwegian Decree of <!--del_lnk--> January 23 <a href="../../wp/1/1928.htm" title="1928">1928</a>, Bouvet&oslash;ya became a Norwegian Territory. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> waived its claim in favour of Norway the following year. In <a href="../../wp/1/1930.htm" title="1930">1930</a> a Norwegian act was passed that made the island a dependent area subject to the <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty of the Kingdom (but not a part of the Kingdom).</p>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/1/1964.htm" title="1964">1964</a>, an abandoned <!--del_lnk--> lifeboat was discovered on the island, along with various supplies; however, the lifeboat's passengers were never found.</p>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/1/1971.htm" title="1971">1971</a>, Bouvet Island and the adjacent territorial waters were designated a nature reserve. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was some interest from <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> to establish a weather station, but conditions were deemed to be too hostile. The island remains uninhabited, although an automated <!--del_lnk--> weather station was set up there in <a href="../../wp/1/1977.htm" title="1977">1977</a> by the Norwegians.</p>
       <p>On <!--del_lnk--> September 22, <a href="../../wp/1/1979.htm" title="1979">1979</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> satellite recorded a flash of light (which was later interpreted as having been caused by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear bomb">nuclear bomb</a> explosion or natural event such as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Meteoroid.htm" title="Meteor">meteor</a>) in a stretch of the southern <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> between Bouvet Island and <!--del_lnk--> Prince Edward Islands. This flash, since dubbed the <!--del_lnk--> Vela Incident, is still not completely resolved.</p>
       <p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 19, <a href="../../wp/2/2007.htm" title="2007">2007</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian Institute of Polar Research announced that satellite photos no longer show the research station built on the island in <a href="../../wp/1/1994.htm" title="1994">1994</a>. It is believed that the uninhabited station has been blown out to sea by the wind. An earthquake in the area in <a href="../../wp/2/2006.htm" title="2006">2006</a> supposedly weakened the building's base, and is believed to have made it more exposed to the powerful winter storms in the area. An unmanned weather station on the island is reportedly still intact.</p>
