Apart from its coastline with the <a href="../../wp/s/South_China_Sea.htm" title="South China Sea">South China Sea</a>, it is completely surrounded by the <!--del_lnk--> state of <!--del_lnk--> Sarawak, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, and it is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of <!--del_lnk--> Limbang. It is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo, with the remainder of the island forming parts of Malaysia and <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Brunei's population was 401,890 in July 2011.</p>
       <p>The official national history claims that Brunei can trace its beginnings to the 7th century, when it was a subject state named P'o-li, in the <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>-centric <!--del_lnk--> Srivijayan empire. It later became a <!--del_lnk--> vassal state of the <!--del_lnk--> Java-centric <!--del_lnk--> Majapahit empire. Brunei became a <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">sultanate</a> in the 14th century, under a newly converted <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> sultan&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Shah.</p>
       <p>At the peak of <!--del_lnk--> Bruneian Empire, <!--del_lnk--> Sultan Bolkiah (reigned 1485&ndash;1528) had control over the northern regions of Borneo, including modern-day Sarawak and <!--del_lnk--> Sabah, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Sulu archipelago off the northeast tip of Borneo, <!--del_lnk--> Seludong (modern day <a href="../../wp/m/Manila.htm" title="Manila">Manila</a>), and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo. The <!--del_lnk--> thalassocracy was visited by Spain's <!--del_lnk--> Magellan Expedition in 1521 and fought Spain in 1578's <!--del_lnk--> Castille War. The Bruneian Empire began to decline, reaching its modern shape in 1890 after the progressive 19th century ceding of Sarawak to the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Sarawak and the ceding of Sabah to the British <!--del_lnk--> North Borneo Chartered Company. Brunei became a British <!--del_lnk--> protectorate in 1888 and was assigned a <!--del_lnk--> British Resident in 1906. In the years after the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> wartime occupation during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, it formalised a constitution and fought an <!--del_lnk--> armed rebellion. Brunei regained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. Economic growth during the 1970s and 1990s, averaging 56% from 1999 to 2008, has transformed Brunei into a newly industrialised country.</p>
       <p>Brunei has the second highest <!--del_lnk--> Human Development Index among the <!--del_lnk--> South East Asia nations after Singapore, and is classified as a <!--del_lnk--> developed country. According to the <!--del_lnk--> International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brunei is ranked fifth in the world by gross domestic product per capita at <!--del_lnk--> purchasing power parity. The IMF also states in a 2011 estimate that Brunei was one of two countries (the other being <a href="../../wp/l/Libya.htm" title="Libya">Libya</a>) with their public debt at 0% of the national GDP. <!--del_lnk--> Forbes also ranks Brunei as the fifth richest nation out of 182 nations due to its extensive petroleum and natural gas fields.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>According to legend, Brunei was founded by Awang Alak Betatar. His move from Garang, a place in the <!--del_lnk--> Temburong District to the Brunei river estuary led to the discovery of Brunei. According to legend, upon landing he exclaimed "Baru nah!" (loosely translating as "that's it!" or "there"), from which the name "Brunei" was derived.</p>
       <p>It was renamed "Barunai" in the 14th century, possibly influenced by the <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word "<span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Sanskrit transliteration">varu&#x1E47;</span>" (<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#x935;&#x930;&#x941;&#x923;</span>), meaning either "ocean" or the mythological "regent of the ocean" ."

       <p>In the absence of any other evidence, scholars have created an early history of Brunei that is mainly based on flexible interpretations of Chinese texts. This early part reads: Chinese records from the sixth century mention a state called P&rsquo;o-li on the northwest coast of Borneo. In the seventh century, Chinese and Arab accounts state a place called Vijayapura, which was thought to be founded by members of the royal family of <!--del_lnk--> Funan. They were believed to have landed on the northwest coast of Borneo with some of their followers. They then captured P&rsquo;o-li and renamed the territory 'Vijayapura' (meaning 'victory' in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>). In 977, Chinese records started to use Po-ni instead of Vijayapura to refer to Brunei. In 1225 a Chinese official named Chua Ju-Kua reported that Brunei has 100 warships to protect its trade and that there was a lot of gold in the kingdom. Another report in 1280 described Po-ni as controlling large parts of <!--del_lnk--> Borneo Island (modern day <!--del_lnk--> Sabah and <!--del_lnk--> Sarawak, <!--del_lnk--> Sulu and some parts of the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>). In the fourteenth century, Po-ni became a <!--del_lnk--> vassal state of Majapahit, and had to pay an annual payment of 40 <!--del_lnk--> katis of <!--del_lnk--> camphor. Po-ni was attacked and looted of its treasure and gold by the Sulus in 1369. A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus but Po-ni became much weaker after the attack. A Chinese report of 1371 described Po-ni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit.</p>
       <p>The power of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultanate">Sultanate</a> of Brunei was at its peak between the 15th and 17th centuries, with its power extending from northern Borneo to the southern Philippines.</p>
       <p>By the 16th century, Islam was firmly rooted in Brunei, and the country had built one of its biggest mosques. In 1578, Alonso Beltr&aacute;n, a Spanish traveler described it as being five stories tall and built on the water.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="War_with_Spain_and_decline">War with Spain and decline</span></h4>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> European influence gradually brought an end to the <!--del_lnk--> regional power, as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. Piracy was also detrimental to the kingdom. Spain <!--del_lnk--> declared war in 1578, attacking and capturing Brunei's capital at the time, <!--del_lnk--> Kota Batu. This was achieved as a result in part of the assistance rendered to them by two Bruneian <!--del_lnk--> noblemen, Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had travelled to Manila to offer Brunei as a <!--del_lnk--> tributary of Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal. The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would indeed become the Sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new <!--del_lnk--> Bendahara. In March 1578, the Spanish fleet, led by <!--del_lnk--> De Sande himself, acting as <!--del_lnk--> Capit&aacute;n-General, started their journey towards Brunei. The expedition consisted of 400 Spaniards, 1,500 <!--del_lnk--> Filipino natives and 300 Borneans. The campaign was one of many, which also included action in <!--del_lnk--> Mindanao and <!--del_lnk--> Sulu.</p>
       <p>The Spanish succeeded in invading the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to <!--del_lnk--> Jerudong. In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei. The Spanish suffered heavy losses due to a <a href="../../wp/c/Cholera.htm" title="Cholera">cholera</a> or <!--del_lnk--> dysentery outbreak. They were so weakened by the illness that they decided to abandon Brunei to return to Manila on 26 June 1578, after just 72 days. Before doing so, they burned the mosque, a high structure with a five-tier roof.</p>
       <p>Pengiran Seri Lela died in August&ndash;September 1578, probably from the same illness that had afflicted his Spanish allies, although there was suspicion he could have been poisoned by the ruling Sultan. Seri Lela's daughter left with the Spanish and went on to marry a Christian <!--del_lnk--> Tagalog, named Agust&iacute;n de Legazpi de Tondo.</p>
       <p>The local Brunei accounts differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events. The <i>Castilian War</i> entering the national conscience as a heroic episode, with the Spaniards being driven out by Bendahara Sakam, supposedly a brother of the ruling Sultan, and a thousand native warriors. This version, nevertheless, is disputed by most historians and considered a <!--del_lnk--> folk-hero recollection, probably created decades or centuries after.</p>
       <p>A <!--del_lnk--> civil war was fought from 1660 to 1673.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The British have intervened in the affairs of Brunei on a number of occasions.</p>
       <p>Britain attacked Brunei on July 1846 due to disagreement as to who was the rightful Sultan.</p>
       <p>In the 1880s, as the decline of the <!--del_lnk--> Bruneian Empire continued, and Brunei lost much of its territory to the ruling <!--del_lnk--> White Rajahs of the neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Sarawak. Sultan <!--del_lnk--> Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin appealed to the British to stop further encroachment. The "Treaty of Protection" was negotiated by <!--del_lnk--> Sir Hugh Low and signed into effect on 17 September 1888. The treaty did state that the Sultan "could not cede or lease any territory to foreign powers without British consent" &ndash; but it also enabled <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">Britain's</a> control over Brunei's external affairs and made it a British <!--del_lnk--> protectorate (which continued until 1984). When the Kingdom of Sarawak annexed Brunei's <!--del_lnk--> Pandaruan district in 1890, the British did not take any action to stop it, as they did not regard either Brunei or the Kingdom of Sarawak as 'foreign' (per the Treaty of Protection). This final annexation by Sarawak left Brunei with its current small landmass and separation into two parts.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> British Residents were introduced in Brunei under the Supplementary Protectorate Agreement in 1906. The Residents were to advise the Sultan on all matters of administration. However, the Resident assumed more executive control than the Sultan. The Residential system ended in 1959.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Discovery_of_oil">Discovery of oil</span></h3>
       <p>Petroleum was discovered in 1929 after several fruitless attempts. Two men, F.F. Marriot and T.G. Cochrane, smelled oil near the <!--del_lnk--> Seria river in late 1926. They informed a geophysicist who then conducted a survey there. In 1927, gas seepages were reported in the area. Seria Well Number One (S-1) was drilled on 12 July 1928. Oil was struck at 297 meters on 5 April 1929. Seria Well Number 2 was drilled on 19 August 1929 and is still producing oil to this date. Oil production increased considerably in the 1930s. In 1940, oil production was at more than six million barrels. The British Malayan Petroleum Company (now <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Royal_Dutch_Shell.htm" title="Brunei Shell Petroleum">Brunei Shell Petroleum</a> Company) was formed on 22 July 1922.</p>
       <p>The first offshore well was drilled in 1957.</p>

       <p>The Japanese invaded Brunei on 16 December 1941, eight days after <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbour">the attack on Pearl Harbour</a>. They landed 10,000 troops of the <!--del_lnk--> Kawaguchi Detachment from <!--del_lnk--> Cam Ranh Bay at <!--del_lnk--> Kuala Belait. After six days fighting they occupied the entire country. The only Allied troops in the area were the 2nd Battalion of the <!--del_lnk--> 15th Punjab Regiment based at <!--del_lnk--> Kuching, <!--del_lnk--> Sarawak.</p>
       <p>Once the Japanese occupied Brunei they made an agreement with <!--del_lnk--> Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin over governing the country. Inche Ibrahim (known later as Pehin Datu Perdana Menteri Dato Laila Utama Awang Haji Ibrahim), a former Secretary to the British Resident, Ernest Edgar Pengilly, was appointed Chief Administrative Officer under the Japanese Governor. The Japanese had proposed that Pengilly retain his position under their administration but he declined. Both he and other British nationals still in Brunei were then interned by the Japanese at <!--del_lnk--> Batu Lintang camp in Sarawak. Ibrahim, while the British officials were under Japanese guard, made a point of personally shaking each one by the hand and wishing them well.</p>
       <p>The Sultan retained his throne and was given a pension and honours by the Japanese. During the later part of the occupation he resided at Tantuya, <!--del_lnk--> Limbang and had little more to do with the Japanese. Most of the Malay government officers were retained by the Japanese. Brunei's administration was reorganised into five prefectures, which included British <!--del_lnk--> North Borneo. The Prefectures included <!--del_lnk--> Baram, <!--del_lnk--> Labuan, <!--del_lnk--> Lawas, and <!--del_lnk--> Limbang. Ibrahim managed to hide a number of significant documents from the Japanese during the occupation. Pengiran Yusuf (later YAM Pengiran Setia Negara Pengiran Haji Mohd Yusuf) along with other Bruneian's were sent to Japan for training. Yusuf was fortunate to survive as he was in <!--del_lnk--> Hiroshima when the <!--del_lnk--> atomic bomb was dropped.</p>
       <p>The British had anticipated a Japanese attack, but lacked the resources to defend the area because of the war in Europe. The troops from the Punjab Regiment filled in the <!--del_lnk--> Seria oilfield oilwells with concrete in September 1941 to deny the Japanese their use. The remaining equipment and installations were destroyed when the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese invaded Malaya. By the end of the war 16 wells at <!--del_lnk--> Miri and Seria had been restarted, with production reaching about half the pre-war level. Coal production at <!--del_lnk--> Muara was also recommenced, but with little success.</p>

       <p>The Japanese language was taught in schools and Government officers were also required to learn Japanese. The local currency was replaced by what was to become known as <!--del_lnk--> <i>duit pisang</i>(banana money). From 1943 hyper-inflation destroyed the currency's value and at the end of the war this currency was worthless. Allied attacks on shipping eventually caused trade to cease with food and medicine falling into short supply. Famine and disease followed.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> airport runway was constructed by the Japanese during the occupation and in 1943 Japanese naval units were based in <!--del_lnk--> Brunei Bay and Labuan. The naval base was destroyed by Allied bombing, however despite being attacked by the Allies towards the end of the war the runway survived and was turned into a proper airport. In 1944 the Allies began a bombing campaign against the occupying Japanese that destroyed much of the town and Kuala Belait, but missed <!--del_lnk--> Kampong Ayer.</p>
       <p>On 10 June 1945 the <!--del_lnk--> Australian 9th Division landed at Muara under <!--del_lnk--> Operation Oboe Six to recapture Borneo from the Japanese. They were supported by American air and naval units. Brunei town was bombed extensively and recaptured after three days of heavy fighting. Many buildings were destroyed including the Mosque. The Japanese forces in Brunei, Borneo, and Sarawak, under Lieutenant-General Masao Baba, formally surrendered at Labuan on 10 September 1945. The British Military Administration took over from the Japanese and remained until July 1946.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Post_World_War_II">Post World War II</span></h3>
       <p>After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, a new government was formed in Brunei under the <!--del_lnk--> British Military Administration (BMA). It consisted mainly of Australian officers and servicemen. The administration of Brunei was handed over to the Civil Administration on 6 July 1945. The Brunei State Council was also revived that year. The BMA was also tasked to revive the Bruneian economy, which was extensively damaged by the Japanese during their occupation. They were also tasked with putting out the fires started on the wells of Seria, which were started by the Japanese prior to their defeat. Before 1941, the Governor of the Straits Settlements based in Singapore was responsible for the duties of British High Commissioner for Brunei, <!--del_lnk--> Sarawak, and <!--del_lnk--> North Borneo (now <!--del_lnk--> Sabah). The first <!--del_lnk--> British High Commissioner for Brunei was the Governor of Sarawak, Sir Charles Ardon Clarke. The Barisan Pemuda (&ldquo;Youth Movement&rdquo;) (abbreviated as BARIP) was the first political party to be formed in Brunei. It was formed on 12 April 1946. The aims of the party were to &ldquo;preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan and the country, and to defend the rights of the Malays.&rdquo; BARIP also contributed to the formation of the country&rsquo;s National Anthem. The party was dissolved in 1948 due to inactivity.</p>
       <p>In 1959, a new constitution was written declaring Brunei a self-governing state, while its foreign affairs, security, and defense remained the responsibility of the United Kingdom. There was a small <!--del_lnk--> rebellion against the monarchy in 1962, which was suppressed with help from the United Kingdom. This event became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Brunei Revolt and was partly responsible for the failure to create the <!--del_lnk--> North Borneo Federation. The rebellion partially affected Brunei's decision to opt out of the Malaysian Federation.</p>
       <p>Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. The official National Day, which celebrates the country's independence, however, is held on 23 February due to tradition.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_of_the_Constitution">Writing of the Constitution</span></h3>
       <p>In July 1953, Sultan <!--del_lnk--> Omar Ali Saifuddien III formed a seven-member committee named Tujuh Serangkai to find out the citizens&rsquo; views regarding a written constitution for Brunei. In May 1954, a meeting attended by the Sultan, the Resident and the High Commissioner was held to discuss the findings of the committee. In March 1959 Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to discuss the proposed Constitution. The British delegation was led by Sir Alan Lennox-Boyd who was the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The British Government later accepted the draft constitution. On 29 September 1959, the Constitution Agreement was signed in <!--del_lnk--> Bandar Seri Begawan. The agreement was signed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia. Some of the points of the constitution were:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The Sultan was made the Supreme Head of State.</li>
        <li>Brunei was responsible for its internal administration.</li>
        <li>The British Government was now responsible for foreign and defence affairs only.</li>
        <li>The post of Resident was abolished and replaced by a British High Commissioner.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Five councils were also set up:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The Executive Council</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> The Legislative Council of Brunei</li>

       </ul>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_National_Development_Plans">The National Development Plans</span></h3>
       <p>A series of National Development Plans were initiated by the 28th Sultan of Brunei, Omar Ali Saifuddien III.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_First_National_Development_Plan">The First National Development Plan</span></h4>
       <p>The First National Development plan was introduced in 1953. A total sum of B$100 million was approved by the Brunei State Council for the plan. E.R. Bevington from the Colonial Office in <a href="../../wp/f/Fiji.htm" title="Fiji">Fiji</a>. A $14 million Gas Plant was built under the plan. In 1954, survey and exploration work were undertaken by the Brunei Shell Petroleum on both offshore and onshore fields. By 1956, production reached 114,700 <!--del_lnk--> bpd. Developments on education were also made. In 1952, a written policy on education was made. By 1958, expenditure on education totaled at $4 million. Communications were also improved with new roads built and reconstruction works at Berakas Airport being completed at 1954.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Second_National_Development_Plan">The Second National Development Plan</span></h4>
       <p>The second National Development Plan was launched in 1962. A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963, with this discovery, <!--del_lnk--> Liquefied Natural Gas became important. Developments in the oil and gas sector have continued actively and oil production has steadily increased since then. The plan also saw an increase of production of meat and eggs. The fishing industry increased its output by 25% throughout the course of the plan. The <!--del_lnk--> deepwater port at <!--del_lnk--> Muara was also constructed under the plan. Power requirements were met and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas. Efforts were made to eradicate <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, with the help of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organisation">World Health Organisation</a>, under the plan. Efforts were successful, bringing down the cases of malaria from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959. The death rate was also brought down from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11.3 per thousand in 1953. This has been attributed to public sanitation and improvement of drainage and the provision of piped pure water to the population.</p>

The government, however, denies this and says that their claim on Limbang was never dropped.</p>

       <p>Brunei is a southeast Asian country consisting of two unconnected parts with the total area of 5,765 square kilometres (2,226&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). It has 161 kilometres (100&nbsp;mi) of coastline next to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/South_China_Sea.htm" title="South China sea">South China sea</a>, and it shares a 381&nbsp;km (237&nbsp;mi) border with Malaysia. It has 500 square kilometres (193&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of territorial waters, and an 200 nautical mile <!--del_lnk--> exclusive economic zone.</p>
       <p>About 97% of the population lives in the larger western part (<!--del_lnk--> Belait, <!--del_lnk--> Tutong, and <!--del_lnk--> Brunei-Muara), while only about 10,000 people live in the mountainous eastern part (<!--del_lnk--> Temburong District). The total population of Brunei is approximately 408,000 as of July 2010, of which around 150,000 live in the capital <!--del_lnk--> Bandar Seri Begawan. Other major towns are the port town of <!--del_lnk--> Muara, the oil producing town of <!--del_lnk--> Seria and its neighboring town, <!--del_lnk--> Kuala Belait. In Belait District, the <!--del_lnk--> Panaga area is home to large numbers of expatriates due to <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Dutch_Shell.htm" title="Royal Dutch Shell">Royal Dutch Shell</a> and British Army housing and several recreational facilities are located there.</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
       <p>This small, wealthy <!--del_lnk--> economy is a mixture of <!--del_lnk--> foreign and <!--del_lnk--> domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation, <!--del_lnk--> welfare measures, and village tradition.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">Crude oil</a> and natural gas production account for about 90% of its GDP. About 167,000 barrels of oil are produced every day, making Brunei the fourth largest producer of oil in South-east Asia. It also produces approximately 895,000,000 cubic feet (25,300,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of liquified natural gas per day, making Brunei the ninth-largest exporter of the substance in the world.</p>
       <p>Substantial income from overseas investment supplements with income from domestic production. Most of these investments are made by the Brunei Investment Agency, an arm of the Ministry of Finance. The government provides for all medical services and subsidizes rice and housing. The national <!--del_lnk--> air carrier, <!--del_lnk--> Royal Brunei Airlines, is trying to make Brunei a modest hub for international travel between Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Central to this strategy is the position that the airline maintains at London Heathrow Airport. It holds a daily slot at the highly capacity-controlled airport, which it serves from Bandar Seri Begawan via Dubai. The airline also has services to major Asian destinations including Shanghai, Bangkok, Singapore and Manila.</p>
       <p>Brunei depends heavily on imports such as agricultural products (e.g. rice, <!--del_lnk--> food products, livestock, etc.), <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">motorcars</a> and <!--del_lnk--> electrical products from other countries. Brunei imports 60% of its food requirements, which around 75% of those food imports come from the ASEAN countries.</p>
       <p>Brunei's leaders are very concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal <!--del_lnk--> social cohesion although it became a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000 <!--del_lnk--> Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Stated plans for the future include upgrading the <!--del_lnk--> labour force, reducing unemployment, which currently stands at 6%, strengthening the banking and tourism sectors, and, in general, further widening the economic base.</p>
       <p>To achieve its target for food self-sufficiency, Brunei renamed its Brunei Darussalam Rice 1 to Laila Rice during the launch of the "Padi Planting Towards Achieving Self-Sufficiency of Rice Production in Brunei Darussalam" ceremony at the Wasan padi fields in April 2009. In August 2009, the Royal Family reaped the first few Laila padi stalks, after years of multiple attempts to boost local rice production, a goal which was envisioned about half a century ago. In July 2009 Brunei launched its national <!--del_lnk--> halal branding scheme, Brunei Halal, with an aim to export to foreign markets.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_rights">Human rights</span></h2>
       <p><b>Women</b></p>
       <p>May 2010, the Sultan appointed the first female Deputy Minister.</p>
       <p>The law stipulates imprisonment of up to 30 years and caning with not fewer than 12 strokes for rape. The law does not criminalize spousal rape; it explicitly states that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, as long as she is not under 13 years of age, is not rape. Protections against sexual assault by a spouse are provided under the amended Islamic Family Law Order 2010 and Married Women Act Order 2010, and the penalty for breaching a protection order is a fine not exceeding BN$2,000 ($1,538) or imprisonment not exceeding six months. During the year 23 rape cases were reported; at year's end police were investigating 11 and had forwarded 10 to the Attorney General Chambers.</p>
       <p>There is no specific domestic violence law, but arrests have been made in domestic violence cases under the Women and Girls Protection Act. The police investigate domestic violence only in response to a report by a victim. The police were generally responsive in the investigation of such cases. During the year there were a total of 62 cases of spousal dispute abuse reported; at year's end 55 cases were under investigation, and eight had been forwarded to the Attorney General Chambers. The criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault is one to two weeks in jail and a fine. An assault resulting in serious injury is punishable by caning and a longer prison sentence.</p>
       <p>A special unit staffed by female officers existed within the police department to investigate domestic abuse and child abuse complaints. A hotline was available for persons to report domestic violence. The Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sport's Department of Community Development provided counseling for women and their spouses. Based on individual circumstances, some female and minor victims were placed in protective custody while waiting for their cases to be brought to court.</p>
       <p>Islamic courts staffed by male and female officials offered counseling to married couples in domestic violence cases. Officials did not encourage wives to reconcile with flagrantly abusive spouses, and Islamic courts recognized assault as grounds for divorce.</p>
       <p>The law prohibits sexual harassment and stipulates that whoever assaults or uses criminal force, intending thereby to outrage or knowing it is likely to outrage the modesty of a person, shall be punished with imprisonment for as much as five years and caning.</p>
       <p>Couples and individuals have the right to decide the number, spacing, and timing of their children and have access to contraceptive devices and methods through the government and private clinics. According to information gathered by the UN, in 2008 the maternal mortality rate was an estimated 21 deaths per 100,000 live births. Citizens enjoy free medical and health care, including skilled attendance during childbirth, prenatal care, and essential obstetric and postpartum care. Women had equal access to diagnostic and treatment facilities for sexually transmitted diseases. Women had equal access to HIV treatment and counseling, as well as follow-up treatment.</p>
       <p>In accordance with the government's interpretation of Qur'anic precepts, Muslim women have rights similar to those of Muslim men in areas such as divorce and child custody. Islamic law requires that males receive twice the inheritance of women. Civil law permits female citizens to pass their nationality on to their children and to own property and other assets, including business properties.</p>
       <p>Unlike in previous years, women with permanent positions in the government could apply for travel allowances for their children; however, they could not do so for their husbands working in the private sector. With this exception, they received the same allowance privileges as their college-educated counterparts. According to government statistics, women made up 57 percent of the civil service force and held 28 percent of senior management posts. Women are not discriminated against in access to employment and business.</p>
       <p><b>Children</b></p>
       <p>Citizenship is derived through one's parents rather than through birth within the country's territory. Parents with stateless status are required to apply for a special pass for a child born in the country; failure to register a child may make it difficult to enroll the child in school.</p>
       <p>By law sexual intercourse with a female under 14 years of age constitutes rape and is punishable by imprisonment for not less than eight years and not more than 30 years and not less than 12 strokes of the cane. The law protects women, girls, and boys from exploitation through prostitution and "other immoral purposes," including pornography.</p>

       <p>The population of Brunei in July 2011 was 401,890 of which 76% live in urban areas. The average life expectancy is 76.37 years. In 2004, 66.3% of the population were <!--del_lnk--> Malay, 11.2% are <!--del_lnk--> Chinese, 3.4% are Indigenous, with smaller groups making up the rest.</p>
       <p>The official <!--del_lnk--> language of Brunei is <!--del_lnk--> Malay, <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> may be used for all official purposes. There is some support for a lingual movement aimed at the 'expansion' of the language in Brunei. The principal spoken language is <!--del_lnk--> Melayu Brunei (Brunei Malay). Brunei Malay is rather divergent from standard Malay and the rest of the Malay dialects, being about 84% cognate with standard Malay, and is mostly mutually unintelligible with it. English and Chinese are also widely spoken, English is also used in business and as the language of instruction from primary to tertiary education, and there is a relatively large <!--del_lnk--> expatriate community. <!--del_lnk--> Bahasa Rojak, often spoken by the public and on some popular radio shows, is known as a "<!--del_lnk--> mixed language" and considered by some to be detrimental to 'standard' Malay. Other languages spoken include <!--del_lnk--> Kedayan, Tutong, <!--del_lnk--> Murut, <!--del_lnk--> Dusun and <!--del_lnk--> Iban.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Islam is the official religion of Brunei, and two-thirds of the population adheres to Islam. Other faiths practiced are <!--del_lnk--> Buddhism (13%, mainly by the Chinese) and <!--del_lnk--> Christianity (10%). <!--del_lnk--> Freethinkers, mostly Chinese, form about 7% of the population. Although most of them practice some form of religion with elements of Buddhism, <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>, they prefer to present themselves as having practised no religion officially, hence labelled as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheists">atheists</a> in official censuses. Followers of indigenous religions are about 2% of the population.</p>

       <p>The population centres in the country are linked by a network of 2,800 kilometres of road. The 135&nbsp;km highway from Muara Town to Kuala Belait is being upgraded to a <!--del_lnk--> dual carriageway.</p>
       <p>Brunei is accessible by air, sea and land transport. <!--del_lnk--> Brunei International Airport is the main entry point to the country. <!--del_lnk--> Royal Brunei Airlines is the national carrier. There is another airfield, the <!--del_lnk--> Anduki Airfield, located in <!--del_lnk--> Seria. The ferry terminal at Muara services regular connections to <!--del_lnk--> Labuan (Malaysia). Speedboats provide passenger and goods transportation to the Temburong district. The main highway running across Brunei is the Tutong-Muara Highway. The country's road network is well developed. Brunei has one main sea port located at Muara.</p>
       <p>With one private car for every 2.09 persons, Brunei has one of the highest car ownership rates in the world. This has been attributed to the absence of a comprehensive transport system, low import tax and low unleaded petrol price of B$0.53 per litre.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Healthcare">Healthcare</span></h2>
       <p>Healthcare in Brunei is charged at B$1 per consultation for citizens. A health centre run by Brunei Shell Petroleum is located in <!--del_lnk--> Panaga. For medical assistance not available in the country, citizens are sent overseas at the government's expense.</p>

       <p>There is currently no <!--del_lnk--> medical school in Brunei, and Bruneians wishing to study to become doctors must attend university overseas. However, the Institute of Medicines had been introduced at the <!--del_lnk--> Universiti Brunei Darussalam and a new building has been built for the faculty. The building, including research lab facilities, was completed in 2009. There has been a School of Nursing since 1951. 58 nurse managers were appointed in RIPAS to improve service and provide better medical care. In December 2008, The nursing college merged with the Institute of Medicines at the Universiti Brunei Darussalam to produce more nurses and midwives. It is now called the PAPRSB (Pengiran Anak Puteri Rashidah Sa'datul Bolkiah) Institute of Health Sciences.</p>
