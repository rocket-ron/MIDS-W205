       <p><b>Biochemistry</b> (from <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">&beta;&#x3AF;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>bios</i>, "life" and <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian <i>k&#x113;me</i>, <!--del_lnk--> "earth") is the study of the <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemical</a> processes in living <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a>. It deals with the <!--del_lnk--> structure and function of cellular components, such as <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">proteins</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Carbohydrate.htm" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrates</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Lipid.htm" title="Lipid">lipids</a>, <!--del_lnk--> nucleic acids, and other <!--del_lnk--> biomolecules. Chemical biology aims to answer many questions arising from biochemistry by using tools developed within <!--del_lnk--> chemical synthesis.</p>
       <p>Although there are a vast number of different biomolecules, many are complex and large molecules (called <i><!--del_lnk--> polymers</i>) that are composed of similar repeating subunits (called <i><!--del_lnk--> monomers</i>). Each class of polymeric biomolecule has a different set of subunit types. For example, a <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a> is a polymer made up of 20 or more <a href="../../wp/a/Amino_acid.htm" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>. Biochemistry studies the chemical properties of important biological molecules, like proteins, in particular the chemistry of <!--del_lnk--> enzyme-<a href="../../wp/c/Catalysis.htm" title="Catalysis">catalyzed</a> <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_reaction.htm" title="Chemical reaction">reactions</a>.</p>
       <p>The biochemistry of <a href="../../wp/c/Cell_%2528biology%2529.htm" title="Cell (biology)">cell</a> <!--del_lnk--> metabolism and the <!--del_lnk--> endocrine system has been extensively described. Other areas of biochemistry include the <a href="../../wp/g/Genetic_code.htm" title="Genetic code">genetic code</a> (<a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a>, <!--del_lnk--> RNA), <!--del_lnk--> protein synthesis, <!--del_lnk--> cell membrane <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transport</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> signal transduction.</p>
       <p>This article only discusses terrestrial biochemistry (<a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a>- and <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>-based), as all the life forms we know are on <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>. Since life forms alive today are hypothesized by most to have descended from the same <!--del_lnk--> common ancestor, they have similar biochemistries, even for matters that seem to be essentially arbitrary, such as <!--del_lnk--> handedness of various biomolecules. It is unknown whether <!--del_lnk--> alternative biochemistries are possible or practical.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Originally, it was generally believed that life was not subject to the laws of science the way non-life was. It was thought that only living beings could produce the molecules of life (from other, previously existing biomolecules). Then, in 1828, <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich W&ouml;hler published a paper on the synthesis of <a href="../../wp/u/Urea.htm" title="Urea">urea</a>, proving that <a href="../../wp/o/Organic_chemistry.htm" title="Organic chemistry">organic</a> compounds can be created artificially.</p>
       <p>The dawn of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first enzyme, <!--del_lnk--> diastase (today called <!--del_lnk--> amylase), in 1833 by <!--del_lnk--> Anselme Payen. <!--del_lnk--> Eduard Buchner contributed the first demonstration of a complex biochemical process outside of a cell in 1896: <!--del_lnk--> alcoholic fermentation in cell extracts of yeast. Although the term &ldquo;biochemistry&rdquo; seems to have been first used in 1882, it is generally accepted that the formal coinage of biochemistry occurred in 1903 by <!--del_lnk--> Carl Neuberg, a German <!--del_lnk--> chemist. Previously, this area would have been referred to as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Biochemistry.htm" title="Physiological chemistry">physiological chemistry</a>. Since then, biochemistry has advanced, especially since the mid-20th century, with the development of new techniques such as <a href="../../wp/c/Chromatography.htm" title="Chromatography">chromatography</a>, <!--del_lnk--> X-ray diffraction, <!--del_lnk--> NMR spectroscopy, <!--del_lnk--> radioisotopic labeling, <!--del_lnk--> electron microscopy and <!--del_lnk--> molecular dynamics simulations. These techniques allowed for the discovery and detailed analysis of many molecules and <!--del_lnk--> metabolic pathways of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cell_%2528biology%2529.htm" title="Cell (biology)">cell</a>, such as <!--del_lnk--> glycolysis and the <!--del_lnk--> Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle).</p>
       <p>Another significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the <!--del_lnk--> gene and its role in the transfer of information in the cell. This part of biochemistry is often called <!--del_lnk--> molecular biology. In the 1950's, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/James_Watson.htm" title="James D. Watson">James D. Watson</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Francis_Crick.htm" title="Francis Crick">Francis Crick</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Rosalind Franklin, and <!--del_lnk--> Maurice Wilkins were instrumental in solving DNA structure and suggesting its relationship with genetic transfer of information. In 1958, <!--del_lnk--> George Beadle and <!--del_lnk--> Edward Tatum received the Nobel Prize for work in fungi showing that one gene produces one enzyme. In 1988, <!--del_lnk--> Colin Pitchfork was the first person convicted of murder with <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> evidence, which led to growth of <!--del_lnk--> forensic science. More recently, <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Z. Fire and <!--del_lnk--> Craig C. Mello received the 2006 Nobel Prize for discovering the role of <!--del_lnk--> RNA interference (<!--del_lnk--> RNAi), in the silencing of gene expression.</p>
       <p>Today, there are three main types of biochemistry as established by Michael E. Sugar. Plant biochemistry involves the study of the biochemistry of <!--del_lnk--> autotrophic organisms such as <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> and other plant specific <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Biochemistry.htm" title="Biochemical">biochemical</a> processes. General <strong class="selflink">biochemistry</strong> encompasses both plant and animal biochemistry. Human/medical/medicinal biochemistry focuses on the biochemistry of humans and medical illnesses.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Carbohydrates">Carbohydrates</span></h2>
       <p>The function of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Carbohydrate.htm" title="Carbohydrates">carbohydrates</a> includes energy storage and providing structure. <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">Sugars</a> are carbohydrates, but not all carbohydrates are sugars. There are more carbohydrates on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Monosaccharides">Monosaccharides</span></h3>
       <div class="thumb tright">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/111/11154.png.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="99" src="../../images/111/11154.png"  width="180" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">
          <div class="magnify"><a class="internal" href="../../images/111/11154.png.htm" title="Enlarge"><img alt="" height="11" src="../../images/1x1white.gif" title="This image is not present because of licensing restrictions" width="15" /></a></div><a href="../../wp/g/Glucose.htm" title="Glucose">Glucose</a></div>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The simplest type of carbohydrate is a <!--del_lnk--> monosaccharide, which among other properties contains carbon, <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, and <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, mostly in a ratio of 1:2:1 (generalized formula C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>O<sub><i>n</i></sub>, where <i>n</i> is at least 3). <a href="../../wp/g/Glucose.htm" title="Glucose">Glucose</a>, one of the most important carbohydrates, is an example of a monosaccharide. So is <!--del_lnk--> fructose, the sugar that gives <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruits</a> their sweet taste. Some carbohydrates (especially after <!--del_lnk--> condensation to oligo- and polysaccharides) contain less carbon relative to H and O, which still are present in 2:1 (H:O) ratio. Monosaccharides can be grouped into <!--del_lnk--> aldoses (having an <!--del_lnk--> aldehyde group at the end of the chain, e. g. glucose) and <!--del_lnk--> ketoses (having a <a href="../../wp/k/Ketone.htm" title="Ketone">keto</a> group in their chain; e. g. fructose). Both aldoses and ketoses occur in an <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_equilibrium.htm" title="Chemical equilibrium">equilibrium</a> between the open-chain forms and (starting with chain lengths of C4) cyclic forms. These are generated by bond formation between one of the hydroxyl groups of the sugar chain with the carbon of the aldehyde or keto group to form a <!--del_lnk--> hemiacetal bond. This leads to saturated five-membered (in furanoses) or six-membered (in pyranoses) <!--del_lnk--> heterocyclic rings containing one O as heteroatom.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Disaccharides">Disaccharides</span></h3>
       <div class="thumb tright">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/111/11159.png.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="90" src="../../images/111/11159.png"  width="180" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Two monosaccharides can be joined together using <!--del_lnk--> dehydration synthesis, in which a hydrogen atom is removed from the end of one molecule and a <!--del_lnk--> hydroxyl group (&mdash;OH) is removed from the other; the remaining residues are then attached at the sites from which the atoms were removed. The H&mdash;OH or H<sub>2</sub>O is then released as a molecule of <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>, hence the term <i>dehydration</i>. The new molecule, consisting of two monosaccharides, is called a <i><!--del_lnk--> disaccharide</i> and is conjoined together by a glycosidic or <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Ether.htm" title="Ether bond">ether bond</a>. The reverse reaction can also occur, using a molecule of water to split up a disaccharide and break the glycosidic bond; this is termed <i><!--del_lnk--> hydrolysis</i>. The most well-known disaccharide is <a href="../../wp/s/Sucrose.htm" title="Sucrose">sucrose</a>, ordinary <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a> (in scientific contexts, called <i>table sugar</i> or <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sugarcane.htm" title="Cane sugar">cane sugar</a></i> to differentiate it from other sugars). Sucrose consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is <!--del_lnk--> lactose, consisting of a glucose molecule and a <!--del_lnk--> galactose molecule. As most humans age, the production of <!--del_lnk--> lactase, the enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose back into glucose and galactose, typically decreases. This results in <!--del_lnk--> lactase deficiency, also called <i>lactose intolerance</i>.</p>
       <p>Sugar polymers are characterised by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A <!--del_lnk--> reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom which can be in equilibrium with the open-chain <!--del_lnk--> aldehyde or keto form. If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the <!--del_lnk--> pyranose or <!--del_lnk--> furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side chain of another sugar, yielding a full <!--del_lnk--> acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety form a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sucrose.htm" title="Saccharose">Saccharose</a> does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).</p>

       <p>When a few (around three to six) monosaccharides are joined together, it is called an <i><!--del_lnk--> oligosaccharide</i> (<i>oligo-</i> meaning "few"). These molecules tend to be used as markers and signals, as well as having some other uses.</p>
       <p>Many monosaccharides joined together make a <!--del_lnk--> polysaccharide. They can be joined together in one long linear chain, or they may be branched. Two of the most common polysaccharides are <!--del_lnk--> cellulose and <!--del_lnk--> glycogen, both consisting of repeating <a href="../../wp/g/Glucose.htm" title="Glucose">glucose</a> <!--del_lnk--> monomers.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Like carbohydrates, some proteins perform largely structural roles. For instance, movements of the proteins <!--del_lnk--> actin and <!--del_lnk--> myosin ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of molecules&mdash;they may be <i>extremely</i> selective in what they bind. <a href="../../wp/a/Antibody.htm" title="Antibody">Antibodies</a> are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. In fact, the <!--del_lnk--> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies, is currently one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the <!--del_lnk--> enzymes. These amazing molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called <i><!--del_lnk--> substrates</i>; they then <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catalysis.htm" title="Catalyze">catalyze</a> the reaction between them. By lowering the <a href="../../wp/a/Activation_energy.htm" title="Activation energy">activation energy</a>, the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 10<sup>11</sup> or more: a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.</p>
       <p>In essence, proteins are chains of <a href="../../wp/a/Amino_acid.htm" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>. An amino acid consists of a carbon atom bound to four groups. One is an <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Amine.htm" title="Amino">amino</a> group, &mdash;NH<sub>2</sub>, and one is a <a href="../../wp/c/Carboxylic_acid.htm" title="Carboxylic acid">carboxylic acid</a> group, &mdash;COOH (although these exist as &mdash;NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and &mdash;COO<sup>&minus;</sup> under physiologic conditions). The third is a simple <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> atom. The fourth is commonly denoted "&mdash;R" and is different for each amino acid. There are twenty standard amino acids. Some of these have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance, glutamate functions as an important <!--del_lnk--> neurotransmitter.</p>
       <div class="thumb tright">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:352px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/111/11174.png.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="93" src="../../images/111/11174.png"  width="350" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Amino acids can be joined together via a <!--del_lnk--> peptide bond. In this dehydration synthesis, a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid's amino group to the carbon of the other's carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is called a <i><!--del_lnk--> dipeptide</i>, and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than around thirty) are called <i><!--del_lnk--> peptides</i> or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title <i>proteins</i>. As an example, the important blood <!--del_lnk--> serum protein <!--del_lnk--> albumin contains 585 amino acid residues.</p>
       <p>The structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels. The <!--del_lnk--> primary structure of a protein simply consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, "alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-&hellip;". <!--del_lnk--> Secondary structure is concerned with local morphology. Some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an <!--del_lnk--> &alpha;-helix or into a sheet called a <!--del_lnk--> &beta;-sheet; some &alpha;-helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic above. <!--del_lnk--> Tertiary structure is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the <!--del_lnk--> glutamate residue at position 6 with a <!--del_lnk--> valine residue changes the behaviour of hemoglobin so much that it results in <a href="../../wp/s/Sickle-cell_disease.htm" title="Sickle-cell disease">sickle-cell disease</a>. Finally <!--del_lnk--> quaternary structure is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.</p>
       <p>Ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the <!--del_lnk--> small intestine, and then absorbed. They can then be joined together to make new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the <!--del_lnk--> pentose phosphate pathway can be used to make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can only synthesize half of them. They cannot synthesize <!--del_lnk--> isoleucine, <!--del_lnk--> leucine, <!--del_lnk--> lysine, <!--del_lnk--> methionine, <!--del_lnk--> phenylalanine, <!--del_lnk--> threonine, <!--del_lnk--> tryptophan, and <!--del_lnk--> valine. These are the <!--del_lnk--> essential amino acids, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize <!--del_lnk--> alanine, <!--del_lnk--> asparagine, <!--del_lnk--> aspartate, <!--del_lnk--> cysteine, <!--del_lnk--> glutamate, <!--del_lnk--> glutamine, <!--del_lnk--> glycine, <!--del_lnk--> proline, <!--del_lnk--> serine, and <!--del_lnk--> tyrosine, the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize <!--del_lnk--> arginine and <!--del_lnk--> histidine, they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.</p>
       <p>If the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an &alpha;-<!--del_lnk--> keto acid. Enzymes called <!--del_lnk--> transaminases can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an &alpha;-keto acid) to another &alpha;-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the &alpha;-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via <!--del_lnk--> transamination. The amino acids may then be linked together to make a protein.</p>
       <p>A similar process is used to break down proteins. It is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids. Free <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> (NH<sub>3</sub>), existing as the <!--del_lnk--> ammonium ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) in blood, is toxic to life forms. A suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist. Different strategies have evolved in different animals, depending on the animals' needs. <!--del_lnk--> Unicellular organisms, of course, simply release the ammonia into the environment. Similarly, <!--del_lnk--> bony fish can release the ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted. In general, mammals convert the ammonia into urea, via the <!--del_lnk--> urea cycle.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lipids">Lipids</span></h2>
       <p>The term lipid comprises a diverse range of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Molecule.htm" title="Molecules">molecules</a> and to some extent is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or <!--del_lnk--> nonpolar compounds of biological origin, including <!--del_lnk--> waxes, <a href="../../wp/f/Fatty_acid.htm" title="Fatty acid">fatty acids</a>, fatty-acid derived <!--del_lnk--> phospholipids, <!--del_lnk--> sphingolipids, <!--del_lnk--> glycolipids and <!--del_lnk--> terpenoids (eg. <!--del_lnk--> retinoids and <!--del_lnk--> steroids). Some lipids are linear <!--del_lnk--> aliphatic molecules, while others have ring structures. Some are <!--del_lnk--> aromatic, while others are not. Some are flexible, while others are rigid.</p>
       <p>Most lipids have some <!--del_lnk--> polar character in addition to being largely nonpolar. Generally, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or <!--del_lnk--> hydrophobic ("water-fearing"), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water. Another part of their structure is polar or <!--del_lnk--> hydrophilic ("water-loving") and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water. This makes them <!--del_lnk--> amphiphilic molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions). In the case of <!--del_lnk--> cholesterol, the polar group is a mere -OH (<!--del_lnk--> hydroxyl or alcohol). In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar, as described below.</p>
       <p>Lipids are an integral part of our daily diet. Most <!--del_lnk--> oils and <!--del_lnk--> milk products that we use for cooking and eating like <a href="../../wp/b/Butter.htm" title="Butter">butter</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cheese.htm" title="Cheese">cheese</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ghee etc, are comprised of <!--del_lnk--> fats. <!--del_lnk--> Vegetable oils are rich in various <!--del_lnk--> polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and <!--del_lnk--> glycerol, which are the final degradation products of fats and lipids.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Nucleic_acids">Nucleic acids</span></h2>
       <p>A nucleic acid is a complex, high-molecular-weight biochemical <!--del_lnk--> macromolecule composed of nucleotide chains that convey <!--del_lnk--> genetic information. The most common nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (<!--del_lnk--> RNA). Nucleic acids are found in all living cells and viruses. Aside from the genetic material of the cell, nucleic acids often play a role as <!--del_lnk--> second messengers, as well as forming the base molecule for <a href="../../wp/a/Adenosine_triphosphate.htm" title="Adenosine triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a>, the primary energy-carrier molecule found in all living organisms.</p>
       <p>Nucleic acid, so called because of its prevalence in cellular <!--del_lnk--> nuclei, is the generic name of the family of <!--del_lnk--> biopolymers. The monomers are called <!--del_lnk--> nucleotides, and each consists of three components: a nitrogenous heterocyclic <!--del_lnk--> base (either a <!--del_lnk--> purine or a <!--del_lnk--> pyrimidine), a <!--del_lnk--> pentose <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, and a <!--del_lnk--> phosphate group. Different nucleic acid types differ in the specific sugar found in their chain (e.g. DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid contains 2-<!--del_lnk--> deoxyriboses). Also, the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different: <!--del_lnk--> adenine, <!--del_lnk--> cytosine, and <!--del_lnk--> guanine occur in both RNA and DNA, while <!--del_lnk--> thymine occurs only in DNA and <!--del_lnk--> uracil occurs in RNA.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Researchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry, but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas from <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> molecular biology and <!--del_lnk--> biophysics. There has never been a hard-line between these disciplines in terms of content and technique, but members of each discipline have in the past been very territorial; today the terms <i>molecular biology</i> and <i>biochemistry</i> are nearly interchangeable. The following figure is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationship between the fields:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><i>Biochemistry</i> is the study of the chemical substances and vital processes occurring in living <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Biochemists focus heavily on the role, function, and structure of <!--del_lnk--> biomolecules. The study of the chemistry behind biological processes and the synthesis of biologically active molecules are examples of biochemistry.</li>
        <li><i>Genetics</i> is the study of the effect of genetic differences on organisms. Often this can be inferred by the absence of a normal component (e.g. one <!--del_lnk--> gene). The study of "<!--del_lnk--> mutants" &ndash; organisms which lack one or more functional components with respect to the so-called "<!--del_lnk--> wild type" or normal <!--del_lnk--> phenotype. <!--del_lnk--> Genetic interactions (<!--del_lnk--> epistasis) can often confound simple interpretations of such "knock-out" studies.</li>
        <li><i>Molecular biology</i> is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the <!--del_lnk--> genetic material. The <!--del_lnk--> central dogma of molecular biology where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein, despite being an oversimplified picture of molecular biology, still provides a good starting point for understanding the field. This picture, however, is undergoing revision in light of emerging novel roles for <!--del_lnk--> RNA.</li>
        <li><i>Chemical Biology</i> seeks to develop new tools based on <!--del_lnk--> small molecules that allow minimal perturbation of biological systems while providing detailed information about their function. Further, chemical biology employs biological systems to create non-natural hybrids between biomolecules and synthetic devices (for example emptied viral capsids that can deliver <!--del_lnk--> gene therapy or drug molecules).</li>
