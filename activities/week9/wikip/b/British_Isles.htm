       <p>The <b>British Isles</b> are a <!--del_lnk--> group of islands off the northwest coast of <!--del_lnk--> continental Europe that include the islands of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and over six thousand smaller isles. Two <!--del_lnk--> sovereign states are located on the islands: <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a> (additionally described as the Republic of Ireland, covering five-sixths of the island of the same name) and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> (commonly known as the United Kingdom). The British Isles also include three <!--del_lnk--> dependencies of the British Crown: the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> and, by tradition, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/Jersey.htm" title="Bailiwick of Jersey">Bailiwick of Jersey</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Guernsey.htm" title="Bailiwick of Guernsey">Bailiwick of Guernsey</a> in the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a>, although the latter are not physically a part of the <!--del_lnk--> archipelago.</p>
       <p>The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, Ireland and North Wales are 2,700 <!--del_lnk--> million years old. During the <a href="../../wp/s/Silurian.htm" title="Silurian">Silurian</a> period the north-western regions <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">collided</a> with the south-east, which had been part of a separate continental landmass. The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards. <a href="../../wp/b/Ben_Nevis.htm" title="Ben Nevis">Ben Nevis</a> rises to an <!--del_lnk--> elevation of only 1,344 metres (4,409&nbsp;ft), <!--del_lnk--> Lough Neagh, which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles, covers 381 square kilometres (147&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). The climate is <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Temperateness.htm" title="Temperateness">temperate</a> <a href="../../wp/o/Oceanic_climate.htm" title="Oceanic climate">marine</a>, with mild winters and warm summers. The <!--del_lnk--> North Atlantic Drift brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 &deg;C (20 &deg;F) above the global average for the latitude. This led to a landscape which was long dominated by <!--del_lnk--> temperate rainforest, although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover. The region was re-inhabited after the <!--del_lnk--> last glacial period of <!--del_lnk--> Quaternary glaciation, by 12,000 BC in Great Britain and 8000 BC in Ireland. At that time, Great Britain was a <!--del_lnk--> peninsula of the European continent from which Ireland had become separated to form an island.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Scoti (Ireland), <!--del_lnk--> Pictish (northern Britain) and <!--del_lnk--> Brythons (southern Britain) tribes inhabited the islands at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD. Much of Brythonic-controlled Britain was <!--del_lnk--> conquered by the Roman Empire from AD 43. The first <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now England. <!--del_lnk--> Viking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements and political change&mdash;particularly in England. The subsequent <!--del_lnk--> Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the later <!--del_lnk--> Angevin partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the <!--del_lnk--> Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of <a href="../../wp/k/Kingdom_of_England.htm" title="Kingdom of England">England</a> and <a href="../../wp/k/Kingdom_of_Scotland.htm" title="Kingdom of Scotland">Scotland</a>, while control in Ireland fluxed between <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic kingdoms, <!--del_lnk--> Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated <!--del_lnk--> Lordship of Ireland, soon restricted only to <!--del_lnk--> The Pale. The 1603 <!--del_lnk--> Union of the Crowns, <a href="../../wp/a/Acts_of_Union_1707.htm" title="Acts of Union 1707">Acts of Union 1707</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Acts of Union 1800 attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland.htm" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as <!--del_lnk--> Crown Dependencies. The expansion of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> and migrations following the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Famine and <!--del_lnk--> Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the <!--del_lnk--> Irish War of Independence and the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Irish Treaty (1919&ndash;1922), with six counties remaining in the UK as <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
       <p>The term <i>British Isles</i> is <!--del_lnk--> controversial in Ireland, where there are objections to its usage due to the association of the word <i>British</i> with Ireland. The <!--del_lnk--> Government of Ireland does not recognise or use the term and its embassy in London discourages its use. As a result, Britain and Ireland is used as an alternative description, and Atlantic Archipelago has had limited use among a minority in academia, although British Isles is still commonly employed.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>The earliest known references to the islands as a group appeared in the writings of sea-farers from the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greek</a> colony of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Marseille.htm#Prehistory_and_classical_antiquity" title="Massalia">Massalia</a>. The original records have been lost; however, later writings that quoted from the <!--del_lnk--> Massaliote Periplus (6th century BC) and <!--del_lnk--> Pytheas's <i>On the Ocean</i> (<!--del_lnk--> circa 325&ndash;320 BC) have survived. In the 1st century BC, <!--del_lnk--> Diodorus used the Latin form, &Pi;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&#x3AF;&alpha; (<i>Prettania</i>) from &Pi;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#x3AE; (<i>Prettanike</i>), <!--del_lnk--> Strabo used &Beta;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&#x3AF;&alpha; (<i>Brettania</i>), and <!--del_lnk--> Marcian of Heraclea, in his <i>Periplus maris exteri</i>, used &alpha;&#x1F31; &Pi;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&alpha;&#x3AF; &nu;&#x1FC6;&sigma;&omicron;&iota; (<i>the Prettanic Isles</i>) to refer to the islands. Historians today, though not in absolute agreement, largely agree that these Greek and Latin names were probably drawn from native <!--del_lnk--> Celtic-language names for the archipelago. Along these lines, the inhabits of the islands of <i>Pretanike</i> were called the &Pi;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&#x3AF; (<i><!--del_lnk--> Priteni</i> or <i>Pretani</i>). The shift from the "P" of <i>Pretannia</i> to the "B" of <i><!--del_lnk--> Britannia</i> by the Romans occurred during the time of <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>.</p>
       <p>The classical writer, Ptolemy, referred to the larger island as <i>Great Britain</i> (<i>Megale Britannia</i>) and to Ireland as <i>Little Britain</i> (<i>Mikra Brettania</i>) in his work, <i><!--del_lnk--> Almagest</i> (147&ndash;148 AD). In his later work, <i><!--del_lnk--> Geography</i> (c. 150 AD), he gave these islands the names <i><!--del_lnk--> Albion</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Iwernia</i>, and <i>Mona</i> (the Isle of Man), suggesting these may have been native names of the individual islands not known to him at the time of writing <i>Almagest</i>. The name <i>Albion</i> appears to have fallen out of use sometime after the <!--del_lnk--> Roman conquest of Great Britain, after which <i>Britain</i> became the more common-place name for the island called Great Britain. <i>Great Britain</i> would return to use a millennium later, in the Middle Ages. At that time, it was used to distinguish the island of Britain from the peninsula of <!--del_lnk--> Brittany, in northern-western France that had been settled by <!--del_lnk--> Britons, which was confusingly similar to the medieval writers. <i>Great Britain</i> and <i>Britain</i> later became synonymous with the <a href="../../wp/k/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain.htm" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
       <p>The earliest known use of the phrase <i>Brytish Iles</i> in the English language is dated 1577 in a work by <!--del_lnk--> John Dee. Today, this name is seen by some as carrying imperialist overtones although it is still commonly used. Other names used to describe the islands include the <i><!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Celtic Isles</i>, <i>Atlantic archipelago</i>, <i>British-Irish Isles</i>, <i>Britain and Ireland</i>, <i>UK and Ireland</i>, and <i>British Isles and Ireland</i>. Owing to political and national associations with the word <i>British</i>, the Government of Ireland does not use the term <i>British Isles</i>  and in documents drawn up jointly between the British and Irish governments, the archipelago is referred to simply as "these islands". Nonetheless, British Isles is still the most widely accepted term for the archipelago.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The British Isles lie at the juncture of several regions with past episodes of <!--del_lnk--> tectonic mountain building. These <!--del_lnk--> orogenic belts form a complex geology which records a huge and varied span of earth history. Of particular note was the <!--del_lnk--> Caledonian Orogeny during the <a href="../../wp/o/Ordovician.htm" title="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> Period, c. 488&ndash;444 <!--del_lnk--> Ma and early <a href="../../wp/s/Silurian.htm" title="Silurian">Silurian</a> period, when the <a href="../../wp/c/Craton.htm" title="Craton">craton</a> <!--del_lnk--> Baltica collided with the <!--del_lnk--> terrane <!--del_lnk--> Avalonia to form the mountains and hills in northern Britain and Ireland. Baltica formed roughly the north western half of Ireland and Scotland. Further collisions caused the <!--del_lnk--> Variscan orogeny in the <a href="../../wp/d/Devonian.htm" title="Devonian">Devonian</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Carboniferous.htm" title="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> periods, forming the hills of <!--del_lnk--> Munster, south-west England, and south Wales. Over the last 500&nbsp;million years the land which forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30&deg;S, crossing the <a href="../../wp/e/Equator.htm" title="Equator">equator</a> around 370&nbsp;million years ago to reach its present northern latitude.</p>
       <p>The islands have been shaped by numerous glaciations during the <!--del_lnk--> Quaternary Period, the most recent being the <!--del_lnk--> Devensian. As this ended, the central <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_Sea.htm" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a> was de-glaciated and the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> flooded, with sea levels rising to current levels some 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, leaving the British Isles in their current form. Whether or not there was a land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland at this time is somewhat disputed, though there was certainly a single ice sheet covering the entire sea.</p>
       <p>The west coasts of Ireland and Scotland that directly face the Atlantic Ocean are generally characterised by long <!--del_lnk--> peninsulas, and headlands and bays; the internal and eastern coasts are "smoother".</p>
       <p>There are about <!--del_lnk--> 136 permanently inhabited islands in the group, the largest two being Great Britain and Ireland. Great Britain is to the east and covers 216,777 km<sup>2</sup> (83,698&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Ireland is to the west and covers 84,406&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (32,589&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). The largest of the other islands are to be found in the <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrides.htm" title="Hebrides">Hebrides</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Shetland.htm" title="Shetland">Shetland</a> to the north, <!--del_lnk--> Anglesey and the Isle of Man between Great Britain and Ireland, and the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> near the coast of France.</p>
       <p>The islands are at relatively low altitudes, with central Ireland and southern Great Britain particularly low lying: the lowest point in the islands is <!--del_lnk--> Holme, Cambridgeshire at &minus;2.75&nbsp;m (&minus;9.02&nbsp;ft). The <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Highlands.htm" title="Scottish Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> in the northern part of Great Britain are mountainous, with <a href="../../wp/b/Ben_Nevis.htm" title="Ben Nevis">Ben Nevis</a> being the highest point on the islands at 1,343&nbsp;m (4,406&nbsp;ft). Other mountainous areas include Wales and parts of Ireland, however only seven peaks in these areas reach above 1,000&nbsp;m (3,281&nbsp;ft). Lakes on the islands are generally not large, although <!--del_lnk--> Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland is an exception, covering 381 square kilometres (147&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). The largest freshwater body in Great Britain (by area) is <!--del_lnk--> Loch Lomond at 71.1 square kilometres (27&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), and <a href="../../wp/l/Loch_Ness.htm" title="Loch Ness">Loch Ness</a>, by volume whilst <!--del_lnk--> Loch Morar is the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles, with a maximum depth of 1,017&nbsp;ft (310&nbsp;m). There are a number of major rivers within the British Isles. The longest is the <!--del_lnk--> Shannon in Ireland at 360.5&nbsp;km (224&nbsp;mi). The river <a href="../../wp/r/River_Severn.htm" title="River Severn">Severn</a> at 354&nbsp;km (220&nbsp;mi) is the longest in Great Britain. The isles have a <!--del_lnk--> temperate <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Oceanic_climate.htm" title="Marine climate">marine climate</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> North Atlantic Drift ("Gulf Stream") which flows from the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> brings with it significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 &deg;C (20 &deg;F) above the global average for the islands' latitudes. Winters are cool and wet, with summers mild and also wet. Most Atlantic <!--del_lnk--> depressions pass to the north of the islands, combined with the general <!--del_lnk--> westerly circulation and interactions with the landmass, this imposes an east-west variation in climate.</p>

       <p>The islands enjoy a mild climate and varied <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soils">soils</a>, giving rise to a diverse pattern of <a href="../../wp/v/Vegetation.htm" title="Vegetation">vegetation</a>. Animal and plant life in the archipelago is similar to that of the northwestern <!--del_lnk--> European continent. However, there are few numbers of <a href="../../wp/s/Species.htm" title="Species">species</a> with Ireland having even less. All native <!--del_lnk--> flora and <!--del_lnk--> fauna in Ireland, for example, is made up of species that migrated from the elsewhere in Europe, and Great Britain in particular. However, the only window during which this could occur was between the end of <!--del_lnk--> the last Ice Age (about 12,000 years ago) and when the land bridge connecting the two islands was flooded by sea (about 8,000 years ago).</p>
       <p>As with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of the mainland due to a small population and later development of trade and industry and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland are maintained by state <!--del_lnk--> forestation programmes. Almost all land outside of urban areas is <a href="../../wp/a/Arable_land.htm" title="Arable land">farmland</a>. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. <a href="../../wp/o/Oak.htm" title="Oak">Oak</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Elm.htm" title="Elm">elm</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Fraxinus.htm" title="Fraxinus">ash</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Beech.htm" title="Beech">beech</a> are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, <a href="../../wp/p/Pine.htm" title="Pine">pine</a> and <!--del_lnk--> birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, <!--del_lnk--> wych elm, birch and pine. Beech and <!--del_lnk--> lime, though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of <!--del_lnk--> grasses and flowering plants. Woods, <!--del_lnk--> hedgerows, mountain slopes and <!--del_lnk--> marshes host <!--del_lnk--> heather, wild grasses, <!--del_lnk--> gorse and <!--del_lnk--> bracken.</p>
       <p>Larger animals, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gray_wolf.htm" title="Wolf">wolf</a>, bear and <!--del_lnk--> reindeer are today extinct. However, some species such as <a href="../../wp/r/Red_deer.htm" title="Red deer">red deer</a> are protected. Other small mammals, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Rabbit.htm" title="Rabbits">rabbits</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fox.htm" title="Foxes">foxes</a>, <!--del_lnk--> badgers, <!--del_lnk--> hares, <a href="../../wp/h/Hedgehog.htm" title="Hedgehog">hedgehogs</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Stoat.htm" title="Stoat">stoats</a>, are very common. <!--del_lnk--> Wild boars have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain <a href="../../wp/o/Otter.htm" title="Otter">otters</a> and <!--del_lnk--> seals are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently on the islands and another 200 migrate to them. Common types are the <a href="../../wp/c/Common_Chaffinch.htm" title="Common Chaffinch">Common Chaffinch</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Common_Blackbird.htm" title="Common Blackbird">Common Blackbird</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/House_Sparrow.htm" title="House Sparrow">House Sparrow</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Common Starling, all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as <!--del_lnk--> pheasant, <!--del_lnk--> partridge, and <!--del_lnk--> Red Grouse. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes of the islands, in particular <!--del_lnk--> salmon, <a href="../../wp/t/Trout.htm" title="Trout">trout</a>, <!--del_lnk--> perch and <a href="../../wp/e/Esox.htm" title="Esox">pike</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Dogfish, <a href="../../wp/c/Cod.htm" title="Cod">cod</a>, <!--del_lnk--> sole, <!--del_lnk--> pollock and <!--del_lnk--> bass are among the sea fish as well as <!--del_lnk--> mussels, crab and <!--del_lnk--> oysters on the coastline. There are more than 21,000 species of insects found on the islands.</p>
       <p>Neither Great Britain nor Ireland are inhabited by many <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Reptile.htm" title="Reptiles">reptiles</a> or <!--del_lnk--> amphibians. Only three <!--del_lnk--> snakes are native to Great Britain: the <!--del_lnk--> common European adder, the <!--del_lnk--> grass snake and the <!--del_lnk--> smooth snake; none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Weasel.htm" title="Weasels">weasels</a>, <!--del_lnk--> polecats, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Wildcat.htm" title="Wildcats">wildcats</a>, most <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Shrew.htm" title="Shrews">shrews</a>, <!--del_lnk--> moles, the <!--del_lnk--> water voles, <a href="../../wp/r/Roe_deer.htm" title="Roe deer">roe deer</a> and <!--del_lnk--> common toads also being absent in Ireland. This patterns in true also for birds and insects. However, notable reversals of this theme include the <!--del_lnk--> Kerry slug and certain species of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Woodlouse.htm" title="Wood lice">wood lice</a>, which are native to Ireland but not found on Great Britain.</p>
       <p>Domestic animals native to the islands include the <!--del_lnk--> Connemara pony, <!--del_lnk--> Shetland pony, <!--del_lnk--> Irish wolfhound and several types of cattle and sheep.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The demographics of the British Isles today are characterised by a generally high density of population in England, which accounts for almost 80% of the total population of the islands. In elsewhere on Great Britain and on Ireland, high density of population is limited to areas around, or close to, a few large cities. The largest urban area by far is the <!--del_lnk--> London metropolitan area with 12&ndash;14&nbsp;million inhabitants. Other major populations centres include <!--del_lnk--> Greater Manchester Urban Area (2.5&nbsp;million), <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands conurbation (2.3&nbsp;million), <!--del_lnk--> West Yorkshire Urban Area (2.1&nbsp;million) in England, <!--del_lnk--> Greater Glasgow (1.7&nbsp;million) in Scotland and <!--del_lnk--> Greater Dublin Area (1.6&nbsp;million) in Ireland.</p>
       <p>The population of England rose rapidly during the 19th and 20th centuries whereas the populations of Scotland and Wales have shown little increase during the 20th century, with the population of Scotland remaining unchanged since 1951. Ireland for most of its history comprised a population proportionate to its land area (about one third of the total population). However, since the <!--del_lnk--> Great Irish Famine, the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine, which caused a century-long population decline, drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles. On a global scale, this disaster led to the creation of an <!--del_lnk--> Irish diaspora that numbers fifteen times the current population of the island.</p>
       <p>The linguistic heritage of the British Isles is rich, with twelve <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Languages">languages</a> from six groups across four branches of the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European <!--del_lnk--> family. The <!--del_lnk--> Insular Celtic languages of the <!--del_lnk--> Goidelic sub-group (Irish, <!--del_lnk--> Manx and <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Gaelic) and the <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic sub-group (<!--del_lnk--> Cornish, Welsh and <!--del_lnk--> Breton, spoken in <!--del_lnk--> north-western France) are the only remaining <!--del_lnk--> Celtic languages&mdash;the last of their continental relations becoming extinct before the 7th century. The <!--del_lnk--> Norman languages of <!--del_lnk--> Guern&eacute;siais, <!--del_lnk--> J&egrave;rriais and <!--del_lnk--> Sarkese spoken in the Channel Islands are similar to French. A <!--del_lnk--> cant, called <!--del_lnk--> Shelta, is a language spoken by <!--del_lnk--> Irish Travellers, often as a means to conceal meaning from those outside the group. However, English, sometimes in the form of <!--del_lnk--> Scots, is the dominant language, with few monoglots remaining in the other languages of the region. The <!--del_lnk--> Norn language of <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Shetland.htm" title="Shetland">Shetland</a> became extinct around 1880.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>There are two <!--del_lnk--> sovereign states in the isles: <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>. Ireland, sometimes called <i>the Republic of Ireland</i>, governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with the remainder of the island forming <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply <i>the United Kingdom</i>, which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> and the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a>. The Isle of Man and the two states of the Channel Islands, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/Jersey.htm" title="Bailiwick of Jersey">Jersey</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Guernsey.htm" title="Bailiwick of Guernsey">Guernsey</a>, are known as the <!--del_lnk--> Crown Dependencies. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence; responsibility for international representation rests largely upon the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the UK. The United Kingdom is made up of four <!--del_lnk--> constituent parts: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have "<!--del_lnk--> devolved" governments meaning that they have their own parliaments/assemblies and are self-governing with respect to certain areas set down by law. For <!--del_lnk--> judicial purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and <!--del_lnk--> England and Wales (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdiction, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.</p>
       <p>Ireland, the United Kingdom and the three Crown Dependencies are all <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary democracies">parliamentary democracies</a>, with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom return <!--del_lnk--> members to <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">parliament in London</a>. In addition to this, voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a <!--del_lnk--> parliament in Edinburgh and to assemblies in <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff and <!--del_lnk--> Belfast respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority rule, however, Northern Ireland uses a system of <!--del_lnk--> power sharing whereby <!--del_lnk--> unionists and <!--del_lnk--> nationalists share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of both groups are required for the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Assembly to make certain decisions. (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern Ireland join with the rest of Ireland.) The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="British monarch">British monarch</a> is the head of state for all parts of the isles except for the Republic of Ireland, where the head of state is the <!--del_lnk--> President of Ireland.</p>
       <p>Ireland and the United Kingdom are part of the European Union (EU). The Crown Dependencies are not a part of the European Union but have certain limited privileges and obligations that were negotiated as a part of the UK's accession to the EU. Neither the United Kingdom or Ireland area part of the <!--del_lnk--> Schengen area, that allow passport-free travel between EU members states. However, since the <!--del_lnk--> partition of Ireland, an informal free-travel area had existed across the region. In 1997, this area required formal recognition during the course of negotiations for the <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam Treaty of the European Union and is now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Common Travel Area.</p>
       <p>Reciprocal arrangements allow British and Irish citizens to full voting rights in the two states. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and <!--del_lnk--> constitutional referendums in the Republic of Ireland, for which there is no comparable franchise in the other states. In the United Kingdom, these pre-date European Union law, and in both jurisdictions go further than that required by European Union law. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland. In 2008, a <!--del_lnk--> UK Ministry of Justice report investigating how to strengthen the British sense of citizenship proposed to end this arrangement arguing that, "the right to vote is one of the hallmarks of the political status of citizens; it is not a means of expressing closeness between countries."</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Peace Process has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both and the Governments of <!--del_lnk--> Ireland and the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom consult on matters not devolved to the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Executive. The <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Executive and the <!--del_lnk--> Government of Ireland also meet as the <!--del_lnk--> North/South Ministerial Council to develop policies common across the island of Ireland.</p>
       <p>These arrangements were made following the 1998 <!--del_lnk--> Belfast Agreement. Another body established under that agreement, the <!--del_lnk--> British-Irish Council, is made up of the major political entities governing the islands. The <!--del_lnk--> British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body (<!--del_lnk--> Irish: <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga"><i>Comhlacht Idir-Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na h&Eacute;ireann</i></span>) predates the British-Irish Council and was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the <!--del_lnk--> Oireachtas, the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">parliament of the United Kingdom</a>, with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislature. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Parliament, the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly for Wales, the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Assembly, the <!--del_lnk--> States of Jersey, the <!--del_lnk--> States of Guernsey and the <!--del_lnk--> High Court of Tynwald (Isle of Man).</p>
       <p>The British-Irish Council does not have executive powers but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance. Similarly, the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members. Reports on its findings are presented to the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom. During the February 2008 meeting of the British-Irish Council, it was agreed to set up a standing secretariat that would serve as a permanent 'civil service' for the Council. Leading on from developments in the British-Irish Council, the chair of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary, <!--del_lnk--> Niall Blaney, has suggested that the body should shadow the British-Irish Council's work.</p>
       <p>Many civil bodies are organised throughout the islands as a whole. For example the <!--del_lnk--> Samaritans, which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions. The <!--del_lnk--> RNLI, the life boats service, is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, covering the waters of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>At the end of the last <!--del_lnk--> ice age, what are now the British Isles were joined to <!--del_lnk--> the European mainland as a mass of land extending north west from the modern-day northern coastline of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Ice covered almost all of what is now Ireland and Great Britain with the exception of most of modern-day <!--del_lnk--> Munster and much of what we now call England. From 14,000 to 10,000 years ago, as the ice melted, sea levels rose separating Ireland from the mainland and also creating the Isle of Man. About two to four millennia later, Great Britain became separated from the mainland. Britain probably became repopulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland. It is likely that Ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island.</p>
       <p>At the time of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, about two thousand years ago, various tribes were inhabiting the islands. The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further, building <a href="../../wp/h/Hadrian%2527s_Wall.htm" title="Hadrian's Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a> to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD. At that time, Ireland was populated by a people known as <!--del_lnk--> Scots, the northern third or so of Great Britain by a people known as <a href="../../wp/p/Picts.htm" title="Picts">Picts</a> and the southern two thirds by <!--del_lnk--> Britons. <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons arrived as <!--del_lnk--> Roman power waned in the 5th century AD. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Scots and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in <!--del_lnk--> the north of what is now England, in <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, having been <!--del_lnk--> Christianised, traditionally by the Romano-Brition, <!--del_lnk--> Saint Patrick. As Europe, including Britain descended turmoil following in the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as <a href="../../wp/d/Dark_Ages_%2528historiography%2529.htm" title="Dark Ages (historiography)">the Dark Ages</a>, Ireland entering a <!--del_lnk--> golden age and <!--del_lnk--> responded with missions, first to Great Britain and then to the continent, founding <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Monastery.htm" title="Monasteries">monasteries</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="Universities">universities</a> and were later joined by <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon missions of the same nature.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Viking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Cork, <a href="../../wp/l/Limerick.htm" title="Limerick">Limerick</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Waterford and <!--del_lnk--> Wexford. England however was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in <!--del_lnk--> Normandy, in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the <!--del_lnk--> Norman <a href="../../wp/n/Norman_conquest_of_England.htm" title="Norman conquest of England">conquest of England in 1066</a>. The remnants of the <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Normandy, which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> to this day. A century later the marriage of the future <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_II_of_England.htm" title="Henry II of England">Henry II of England</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor of Aquitaine created the <!--del_lnk--> Angevin Empire, partially under the <a href="../../wp/l/List_of_French_monarchs.htm" title="List of French monarchs">French Crown</a>. At the invitation of <!--del_lnk--> a provincial king and under <!--del_lnk--> the authority of <!--del_lnk--> Pope Adrian IV (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the <!--del_lnk--> Angevins invaded Ireland in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of <!--del_lnk--> the Irish High King to ensure the terms of the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Windsor led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of <!--del_lnk--> Lord of Ireland. This title was granted to his younger son but when Henry's heir unexpectedly died the title of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/List_of_English_monarchs.htm" title="King of England">King of England</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Lord of Ireland became entwined in one person.</p>
       <p>By the <!--del_lnk--> Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of <a href="../../wp/k/Kingdom_of_England.htm" title="Kingdom of England">England</a> and <a href="../../wp/k/Kingdom_of_Scotland.htm" title="Kingdom of Scotland">Scotland</a>. Power in Ireland fluxed between <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic kingdoms, <!--del_lnk--> Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated <!--del_lnk--> Lordship of Ireland. A similar situation existed in the <!--del_lnk--> Principality of Wales, which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England as from being <!--del_lnk--> vassal of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/List_of_French_monarchs.htm" title="King of France">King of France</a>. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as "the only Supreme Head in Earth of the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>", thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church. Ireland, which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion invasion was declared <a href="../../wp/k/Kingdom_of_Ireland.htm" title="Kingdom of Ireland">a separate kingdom</a> in personal union with England.</p>
       <p>Scotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland <!--del_lnk--> inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in <!--del_lnk--> Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting <a href="../../wp/e/English_Civil_War.htm" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> or <!--del_lnk--> War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new <!--del_lnk--> Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterated the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new class was Protestant and British the common people were, largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The "<a href="../../wp/g/Glorious_Revolution.htm" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Limerick. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics.</p>
       <p>The Kingdoms of England and Scotland were <a href="../../wp/a/Acts_of_Union_1707.htm" title="Acts of Union 1707">unified in 1707</a> creating the <a href="../../wp/k/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain.htm" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. Following an attempted republican <!--del_lnk--> revolution in Ireland in 1798, the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were <!--del_lnk--> unified in 1801, creating the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland.htm" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom</a>. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown (effectively the British government). Although, the colonies of North American that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century, the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> expanded rapidly elsewhere. A century later it would cover one third of the globe. Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate however and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working class. Mass migrations following the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Famine and <!--del_lnk--> Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second-half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the <!--del_lnk--> Irish War of Independence and the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Irish Treaty (1919&ndash;1922), with the six counties that formed <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> remaining as an autonomous region of the UK.</p>

       <p>The United Kingdom and Ireland have separate media, although British television, newspapers and magazines are widely available in Ireland, giving people in Ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in the United Kingdom. Certain reality TV shows have embraced the whole of the islands, for example <i><!--del_lnk--> The X Factor</i>, seasons 3, 4 and 7 of which featured auditions in Dublin and were open to Irish voters, whilst the show previously known as <i>Britain's Next Top Model</i> became <i><!--del_lnk--> Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model</i> in 2011. A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Costa Book Awards are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The <!--del_lnk--> Man Booker Prize is awarded to authors from the <a href="../../wp/c/Commonwealth_of_Nations.htm" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> and Ireland. The <!--del_lnk--> Mercury Music Prize is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group.</p>
       <p>Many globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the British Isles, including <!--del_lnk--> golf, <!--del_lnk--> association football, <!--del_lnk--> cricket, <a href="../../wp/r/Rugby_football.htm" title="Rugby football">rugby</a>, <!--del_lnk--> snooker and <!--del_lnk--> darts, as well as many minor sports such as <!--del_lnk--> croquet, <!--del_lnk--> bowls, <!--del_lnk--> pitch and putt, <!--del_lnk--> water polo and <!--del_lnk--> handball. A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is <a href="../../wp/a/Association_football.htm" title="Association football">association football</a>. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. <a href="../../wp/r/Rugby_union.htm" title="Rugby union">Rugby union</a> is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from <a href="../../wp/e/England_national_rugby_union_team.htm" title="England national rugby union team">England</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland_national_rugby_union_team.htm" title="Ireland national rugby union team">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland_national_rugby_union_team.htm" title="Scotland national rugby union team">Scotland</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Wales_national_rugby_union_team.htm" title="Wales national rugby union team">Wales</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> British and Irish Lions is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the <!--del_lnk--> southern hemisphere rugby playing nations every four years. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. These national rugby teams play each other each year for the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Crown as part of the <a href="../../wp/s/Six_Nations_Championship.htm" title="Six Nations Championship">Six Nations Championship</a>. Also since 2001 the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy compete against each other in the <!--del_lnk--> RaboDirect Pro12.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/r/Ryder_Cup.htm" title="Ryder Cup">Ryder Cup</a> in <a href="../../wp/g/Golf.htm" title="Golf">golf</a> was originally played between a United States team and a team representing Great Britain and Ireland.

       <p>The idea of building a <!--del_lnk--> tunnel under the Irish Sea has been raised since 1895, when it was first investigated. Several potential Irish Sea tunnel projects have been proposed, most recently the <i>Tusker Tunnel</i> between the ports of <!--del_lnk--> Rosslare and <!--del_lnk--> Fishguard proposed by <!--del_lnk--> The Institute of Engineers of Ireland in 2004. A rail tunnel was proposed in 1997 on a different route, between <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Holyhead, by British engineering firm Symonds. Either tunnel, at 80&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;mi), would be by far the longest in the world, and would cost an estimated &euro;20&nbsp;billion. A proposal in 2007, estimated the cost of building a bridge from <!--del_lnk--> County Antrim in Northern Ireland to <!--del_lnk--> Galloway in Scotland at &pound;3.5bn (&euro;5bn).</p>
