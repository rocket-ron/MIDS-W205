       <p><b>Beer</b> is an <!--del_lnk--> alcoholic beverage produced by the <!--del_lnk--> saccharification of <!--del_lnk--> starch and <!--del_lnk--> fermentation of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification <!--del_lnk--> enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly <!--del_lnk--> malted barley and malted wheat. Most beer is also flavoured with <!--del_lnk--> hops, which <!--del_lnk--> add bitterness and act as a natural <!--del_lnk--> preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The preparation of beer is called <!--del_lnk--> brewing.</p>
       <p>Beer is the world's most widely consumed <!--del_lnk--> alcoholic beverage; it is the third-most popular drink overall, after <a href="../../wp/d/Drinking_water.htm" title="Drinking water">water</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tea.htm" title="Tea">tea</a>. It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage.</p>
       <p>Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the <a href="../../wp/c/Code_of_Hammurabi.htm" title="Code of Hammurabi">Code of Hammurabi</a> included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and "The Hymn to <!--del_lnk--> Ninkasi", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. Today, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant <!--del_lnk--> multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from <!--del_lnk--> brewpubs to <!--del_lnk--> regional breweries.</p>
       <p>The strength of beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (<!--del_lnk--> abv) although it may vary between 0.5% (de-alcoholized) and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% abv and above in recent years.</p>
       <p>Beer forms part of the culture of beer-drinking nations and is associated with social traditions such as <!--del_lnk--> beer festivals, as well as a rich <!--del_lnk--> pub culture involving activities like <!--del_lnk--> pub crawling and <!--del_lnk--> pub games such as <!--del_lnk--> bar billiards.</p>

       <p>Beer is one of the world's oldest prepared beverages, possibly dating back to the <!--del_lnk--> early Neolithic or 9500 BC, when cereal was first <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_agriculture.htm" title="History of agriculture">farmed</a>, and is recorded in the written history of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. Archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations.</p>
       <p>The earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa 3500&ndash;3100 BC from the site of <!--del_lnk--> Godin Tepe in the <!--del_lnk--> Zagros Mountains of western <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>. Some of the earliest Sumerian writings found in the region contain references to a type of beer; one such example, a prayer to the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Ninkasi, known as "The Hymn to Ninkasi", served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. The <!--del_lnk--> Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in <!--del_lnk--> Ebla, <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> and date back to 2500 BC, reveal that the city produced a range of beers, including one that appears to be named "Ebla" after the city. A fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC. Unlike <!--del_lnk--> sake, mold was not used to saccharify the rice (amylolytic fermentation); the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or <!--del_lnk--> malting,</p>
       <p>Almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation. It is likely that many cultures, on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch, independently invented beer. Bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technology and contributed to the building of civilizations.</p>
       <p>Beer was spread through Europe by <!--del_lnk--> Germanic and <!--del_lnk--> Celtic tribes as far back as 3000 BC, and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale. The product that the early Europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today. Alongside the basic starch source, the early European beers might contain fruits, honey, numerous types of plants, spices and other substances such as <!--del_lnk--> narcotic herbs. What they did not contain was <!--del_lnk--> hops, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian Abbot and again in 1067 by Abbess <!--del_lnk--> Hildegard of Bingen.</p>

       <p>In 1516, <!--del_lnk--> William IV, Duke of Bavaria, adopted the <i><!--del_lnk--> Reinheitsgebot</i> (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality regulation still in use in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water, <!--del_lnk--> hops and barley-<!--del_lnk--> malt. Beer produced before the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Monastery.htm" title="Monasteries">monasteries</a>. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from <!--del_lnk--> artisanal manufacture to <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">industrial manufacture</a>, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century. The development of <!--del_lnk--> hydrometers and <!--del_lnk--> thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results.</p>
       <p>Today, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from <!--del_lnk--> brewpubs to <!--del_lnk--> regional breweries. As of 2006, more than 133 billion liters (35 billion gallons), the equivalent of a cube 510 metres on a side, of beer are sold per year, producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (&pound;147.7 billion).</p>
       <p>In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 million hectoliters (45 billion liters) or nearly twice that of the United States but only 5 percent sold were Premium draught beers, compared with 50 percent in France and Germany.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The process of making beer is known as brewing. A dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a <!--del_lnk--> brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as <!--del_lnk--> homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in <!--del_lnk--> developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the USA in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.</p>
       <p>The purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called <!--del_lnk--> wort and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Brewer's yeast">yeast</a>.</p>

       <p>The first step, where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, is known as "<!--del_lnk--> mashing". Hot water (known as "liquor" in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as "<!--del_lnk--> grist") in a <!--del_lnk--> mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called <i>wort separation</i>. The traditional process for wort separation is <!--del_lnk--> lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist. Most modern breweries use a continuous sparge, collecting the original wort and the sparge water together. However, it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.</p>
       <p>The sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle, or "copper", (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper) and boiled, usually for about one hour. During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage. <!--del_lnk--> Hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, flavour and aroma. Hops may be added at more than one point during the boil. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer.</p>
       <p>After boiling, the hopped wort is now cooled, ready for the yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing alcohol, fine <!--del_lnk--> particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.</p>
       <p>Fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of <!--del_lnk--> secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is <a href="#Packaging">packaged</a> either into casks for <!--del_lnk--> cask ale or kegs, <!--del_lnk--> aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.</p>

       <p>The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as <!--del_lnk--> malted <a href="../../wp/b/Barley.htm" title="Barley">barley</a>, able to be saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide); a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Brewer's yeast">brewer's yeast</a> to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as <!--del_lnk--> hops. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an <!--del_lnk--> adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley. Less widely used starch sources include <!--del_lnk--> millet, <a href="../../wp/s/Sorghum.htm" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a> and <!--del_lnk--> cassava root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and <!--del_lnk--> agave in Mexico, among others. The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the <!--del_lnk--> grain bill.</p>
       <dl>
        <dt>Water</dt>
       </dl>
       <p>Beer is composed mostly of water. Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character. For example, <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> has <!--del_lnk--> hard water well-suited to making <!--del_lnk--> stout, such as <a href="../../wp/g/Guinness.htm" title="Guinness">Guinness</a>; while <!--del_lnk--> Plze&#x148; has soft water well-suited to making <!--del_lnk--> pale lager, such as <!--del_lnk--> Pilsner Urquell. The waters of <!--del_lnk--> Burton in England contain <a href="../../wp/g/Gypsum.htm" title="Gypsum">gypsum</a>, which benefits making <!--del_lnk--> pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as <!--del_lnk--> Burtonisation.</p>
       <dl>
        <dt>Starch source</dt>
       </dl>
       <p>The starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin <!--del_lnk--> germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.</p>
       <p>Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the <!--del_lnk--> mash, and act as a filter bed during <!--del_lnk--> lautering, when sweet <!--del_lnk--> wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Oat.htm" title="Oats">oats</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. In recent years, a few brewers have produced <!--del_lnk--> gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume <!--del_lnk--> gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.</p>

       <p>Flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops. The flower of the <!--del_lnk--> hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. The flowers themselves are often called "hops".</p>
       <p>The first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as <!--del_lnk--> Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century. Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, <i><!--del_lnk--> Glechoma hederacea</i>. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like <!--del_lnk--> wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as <!--del_lnk--> gruit and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.</p>
       <p>Hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the <!--del_lnk--> International Bitterness Units scale. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer. Hops have an <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Antibacterial.htm" title="Antibiotic">antibiotic</a> effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in "<!--del_lnk--> head retention", the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last. The acidity of hops is a preservative.</p>
       <dl>
        <dt>Yeast</dt>
       </dl>
       <p>Yeast is the <!--del_lnk--> microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer. Yeast <!--del_lnk--> metabolises the sugars extracted from grains, which produces <a href="../../wp/e/Ethanol.htm" title="Ethanol">alcohol</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, and thereby turns <!--del_lnk--> wort into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour. The dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Top-fermenting yeast">top-fermenting</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Bottom-fermenting">bottom-fermenting</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Saccharomyces uvarum</i>. <i><!--del_lnk--> Brettanomyces</i> ferments <!--del_lnk--> lambics, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Torulaspora delbrueckii</i> ferments Bavarian <!--del_lnk--> weissbier. Before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts. A few styles such as <!--del_lnk--> lambics rely on this method today, but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast <!--del_lnk--> cultures.</p>
       <dl>
        <dt>Clarifying agent</dt>
       </dl>
       <p>Some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer, which typically <!--del_lnk--> precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear <!--del_lnk--> bright and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as <!--del_lnk--> wheat beers.</p>
       <p>Examples of clarifying agents include <!--del_lnk--> isinglass, obtained from <!--del_lnk--> swimbladders of fish; <!--del_lnk--> Irish moss, a seaweed; kappa <!--del_lnk--> carrageenan, from the seaweed <i><!--del_lnk--> Kappaphycus cottonii</i>; <!--del_lnk--> Polyclar (artificial); and <!--del_lnk--> gelatin. If a beer is marked "suitable for Vegans", it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents.</p>

The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (18,000 hectolitres/ 475,000 US gallons) a year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a <!--del_lnk--> pub or other <!--del_lnk--> eating establishment.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> SABMiller became the largest brewing company in the world when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand <!--del_lnk--> Grolsch. <!--del_lnk--> InBev was the second-largest beer-producing company in the world and <!--del_lnk--> Anheuser-Busch held the third spot, but after the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch by InBev, the new <!--del_lnk--> Anheuser-Busch InBev company is currently the largest brewer in the world.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Brewing at home is subject to regulation and prohibition in many countries. Restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the UK in 1963, Australia followed suit in 1972, and the USA in 1978, though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production.</p>

       <p>Top-fermented beers are most commonly produced with <i><!--del_lnk--> Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Top-fermenting yeast">top-fermenting yeast</a> which <!--del_lnk--> clumps and rises to the surface, typically between 15 and 24 &deg;C (60 and 75 &deg;F). At these temperatures, yeast produces significant amounts of <!--del_lnk--> esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products, and the result is often a beer with slightly "fruity" compounds resembling apple, pear, pineapple, banana, plum, or prune, among others.</p>
       <p>Before the introduction of hops into England from the Netherlands in the 15th century, the name "ale" was exclusively applied to unhopped fermented beverages, the term <i>beer</i> being gradually introduced to describe a brew with an infusion of hops. The word <i>ale</i> may come from the <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English.htm" title="Old English">Old English</a> <i>ealu</i>, in turn from the <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Indo-European base <i>*alut-</i>, which holds connotations of "sorcery, magic, possession, intoxication".</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Real ale is the term coined by the <!--del_lnk--> Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) in 1973 for "beer brewed from traditional ingredients, matured by <!--del_lnk--> secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of <!--del_lnk--> extraneous carbon dioxide". It is applied to <!--del_lnk--> bottle conditioned and <!--del_lnk--> cask conditioned beers.</p>

        <dt>Pale Ale</dt>
       </dl>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Pale ale is a beer which uses a top-fermenting yeast and predominantly pale malt. It is one of the world's major beer styles.</p>
       <dl>
        <dt>Stout</dt>
       </dl>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley, and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast. There are a number of variations including Baltic porter, dry stout, and Imperial stout. The name Porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river <!--del_lnk--> porters of London. This same beer later also became known as stout, though the word stout had been used as early as 1677. The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined.</p>
       <dl>
        <dt>Mild</dt>
       </dl>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Mild ale has a predominantly malty palate. It is usually dark coloured with an <!--del_lnk--> abv of 3% to 3.6%, although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching 6% abv and higher.</p>
       <dl>
        <dt>Wheat</dt>
       </dl>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Wheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of <!--del_lnk--> malted barley. Wheat beers are usually <!--del_lnk--> top-fermented (in Germany they have to be by law). The flavour of wheat beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific style.</p>
       <dl>
        <dt>Lager</dt>
       </dl>
       <p><a href="../../wp/l/Lager.htm" title="Lager">Lager</a> is the English name for cool fermenting beers of Central European origin. <!--del_lnk--> Pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world. The name "lager" comes from the German "lagern" for "to store", as brewers around Bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months. These brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment, and to also clear of sediment, when stored in cool conditions.</p>
       <p>Lager yeast is a cool bottom-fermenting yeast (<i><!--del_lnk--> Saccharomyces pastorianus</i>) and typically undergoes primary fermentation at 7&ndash;12&nbsp;&deg;C (45&ndash;54&nbsp;&deg;F) (the fermentation phase), and then is given a long secondary fermentation at 0&ndash;4&nbsp;&deg;C (32&ndash;39&nbsp;&deg;F) (the lagering phase). During the secondary stage, the lager clears and mellows. The cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of <!--del_lnk--> esters and other byproducts, resulting in a "cleaner"-tasting beer.</p>
       <p>Modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the <!--del_lnk--> Spaten Brewery in Bavaria, and <!--del_lnk--> Anton Dreher, who began brewing a lager (now known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Lager.htm" title="Vienna lager">Vienna lager</a>), probably of amber-red colour, in <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> in 1840&ndash;1841. With improved modern yeast strains, most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage, typically 1&ndash;3 weeks.</p>

        <dt>Lambic</dt>
       </dl>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Lambic, a beer of <!--del_lnk--> Belgium, is naturally fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many of these are not strains of brewer's yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness. Yeast varieties such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Brettanomyces bruxellensis</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Brettanomyces lambicus</i> are common in lambics. In addition, other organisms such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Lactobacillus</i> bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.</p>

       <p>Beer is measured and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived <!--del_lnk--> bitterness is measured by the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the <!--del_lnk--> American Society of Brewing Chemists and the <!--del_lnk--> European Brewery Convention. The international scale was a development of the European Bitterness Units scale, often abbreviated as EBU, and the bitterness values should be identical.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Beer colour is determined by the malt. The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. <i>Pale lager</i> and <i>pale ale</i> are terms used for beers made from malt dried with <!--del_lnk--> coke. Coke was first used for roasting malt in 1642, but it was not until around 1703 that the term <i>pale ale</i> was used.</p>
       <p>In terms of sales volume, most of today's beer is based on the pale lager brewed in 1842 in the town of <!--del_lnk--> Pilsen in the present-day <!--del_lnk--> Czech Republic. The modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation (fizzy bubbles) and a typical <!--del_lnk--> alcohol by volume content of around 5%. The <!--del_lnk--> Pilsner Urquell, <!--del_lnk--> Bitburger, and <!--del_lnk--> Heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, as are the American brands <!--del_lnk--> Budweiser, <!--del_lnk--> Coors, and <!--del_lnk--> Miller.</p>
       <p>Dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants&mdash;such as caramel&mdash;are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as <!--del_lnk--> stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Strength">Strength</span></h3>
       <p>Beer ranges from less than 3% <!--del_lnk--> alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14% abv, though this strength can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast, and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process. The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style. The <!--del_lnk--> pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4&ndash;6%, with a typical abv of 5%. The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many <!--del_lnk--> session beers being around 4% abv. Some beers, such as <!--del_lnk--> table beer are of such low alcohol content (1%&ndash;4%) that they are served instead of <a href="../../wp/s/Soft_drink.htm" title="Soft drink">soft drinks</a> in some schools.</p>
       <p>The alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily "light" beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.</p>

       </dl>
       <p>The strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the 20th century. Vetter 33, a 10.5% abv (33 <!--del_lnk--> degrees Plato, hence Vetter "33") <!--del_lnk--> doppelbock, was listed in the 1994 <i><!--del_lnk--> Guinness Book of World Records</i> as the strongest beer at that time, though <!--del_lnk--> Samichlaus, by the Swiss brewer H&uuml;rlimann, had also been listed by the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> as the strongest at 14% abv. Since then, some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers. <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Adams reached 20% abv with <i>Millennium</i>, and then surpassed that amount to 25.6% abv with <!--del_lnk--> Utopias. The strongest beer brewed in Britain was Baz's Super Brew by Parish Brewery, a 23% abv beer. In September 2011, the Scottish brewery <!--del_lnk--> BrewDog produced Ghost Deer, which, at 28%, they claim to be the world's strongest beer produced by fermentation alone.</p>
       <p>The product claimed to be the strongest beer made is Schorschbr&auml;u's 2011 <i>Schorschbock 57</i> with 57,5%. It was preceded by <i>The End of History</i>, a 55% <!--del_lnk--> Belgian ale, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had previously made <i>Sink The Bismarck!</i>, a 41% abv <!--del_lnk--> IPA, and <i>Tactical Nuclear Penguin</i>, a 32% abv <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Stout. Each of these beers are made using the <!--del_lnk--> eisbock method of <!--del_lnk--> fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as <a href="../../wp/d/Distilled_beverage.htm" title="Distilled beverage">spirits</a> rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbr&auml;u's <i>Schorschbock</i>, a 31% abv eisbock, and <!--del_lnk--> Hair of the Dog's <i>Dave</i>, a 29% abv <!--del_lnk--> barley wine made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv <!--del_lnk--> blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a <!--del_lnk--> Dutch brewery in July 2010.</p>

       <p><b>Draught beer</b> from a pressurised <!--del_lnk--> keg is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing <!--del_lnk--> tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">Nitrogen</a> produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense <!--del_lnk--> head and a creamy <!--del_lnk--> mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called <!--del_lnk--> beer balls.</p>
       <p>In the 1980s, Guinness introduced the <!--del_lnk--> beer widget, a nitrogen-pressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense, tight head, similar to beer served from a nitrogen system. The words <i>draft</i> and <i>draught</i> can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or <!--del_lnk--> bottled beers containing a beer widget, or which are cold-filtered rather than pasteurised.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Cask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed "<!--del_lnk--> real ale" by the <!--del_lnk--> CAMRA organisation. Typically, when a cask arrives in a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a "<!--del_lnk--> stillage" which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between 11&ndash;13&nbsp;&deg;C&nbsp;/ 52&ndash;55&nbsp;&deg;F), before being tapped and vented&mdash;a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard <!--del_lnk--> spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to "drop" (clear) again, as well as to fully condition&mdash;this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump, or simply being "gravity-fed" directly into the glass.</p>
       <p>Draught beer's environmental impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, shows that the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer is estimated to be 2.5 square meters (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Packaging">Packaging</span></h3>
       <p>Most beers are cleared of yeast by <!--del_lnk--> filtering when packaged in bottles and cans. However, <!--del_lnk--> bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast&mdash;either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with <!--del_lnk--> wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.</p>
       <p>Many beers are sold in cans, though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries. In Sweden in 2001, 63.9% of beer was sold in cans. People either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass. Cans protect the beer from light (thereby preventing <!--del_lnk--> "skunked" beer) and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles. Cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer, then became commonly associated with less expensive, mass-produced beers, even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles. Plastic (<!--del_lnk--> PET) bottles are used by some breweries.</p>

       <p>The temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinker's experience; warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing.

       <p>Drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial <!--del_lnk--> refrigeration and by the 1870s, was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager. Chilling beer makes it more refreshing, though below <span style="white-space:nowrap;">15.5 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(59.9&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> the chilling starts to reduce taste awareness and reduces it significantly below <span style="white-space:nowrap;">10 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(50&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>. Beer served unchilled&mdash;either cool or at room temperature, reveal more of their flavours. <!--del_lnk--> Cask Marque, a non-profit UK beer organisation, has set a temperature standard range of 12&deg;-14&nbsp;&deg;C (53&deg;-57&nbsp;&deg;F) for cask ales to be served.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vessels">Vessels</span></h3>
       <p>Beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels, such as a glass, a <!--del_lnk--> beer stein, a mug, a <!--del_lnk--> pewter <!--del_lnk--> tankard, a beer bottle or a can. The shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales.</p>
       <p>The pouring process has an influence on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the <!--del_lnk--> tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and <!--del_lnk--> turbulence of the beer and its release of <!--del_lnk--> carbonation.</p>

       <p>In most societies, beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage.</p>
       <p>Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending <!--del_lnk--> beer festivals; visiting a <!--del_lnk--> series of pubs in one evening; joining an organisation such as <!--del_lnk--> CAMRA; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or <!--del_lnk--> rating beer. <!--del_lnk--> Drinking games, such as <!--del_lnk--> beer pong, are also popular. A relatively new profession is that of the <!--del_lnk--> beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.</p>
       <p>Beer is considered to be a social lubricant in many societies and is <!--del_lnk--> consumed in countries all over the world. There are breweries in Middle Eastern countries such as <!--del_lnk--> Iran and <!--del_lnk--> Syria, and in <!--del_lnk--> African countries. Sales of beer are four times those of wine, which is the second most popular alcoholic beverage.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_effects">Health effects</span></h3>
       <p>The main active ingredient of beer is alcohol, and therefore, the health effects of alcohol apply to beer. The moderate consumption of alcohol, including beer, is associated with a decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and cognitive decline. The <!--del_lnk--> long term health effects of continuous, heavy alcohol consumption can, however, include the risk of developing <!--del_lnk--> alcoholism and <!--del_lnk--> alcoholic liver disease.</p>

       <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Brewer's yeast">Brewer's yeast</a> is known to be a rich source of nutrients; therefore, as expected, beer can contain significant amounts of nutrients, including <a href="../../wp/m/Magnesium.htm" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Selenium.htm" title="Selenium">selenium</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <!--del_lnk--> biotin, chromium and <a href="../../wp/b/B_vitamins.htm" title="B vitamins">B vitamins</a>. In fact, beer is sometimes referred to as "liquid bread". Some sources maintain that filtered beer loses much of its nutrition.</p>
       <p>A 2005 Japanese study found that <!--del_lnk--> low alcohol beer may possess strong anti-cancer properties. Another study found nonalcoholic beer to mirror the cardiovascular benefits associated with moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages. However, much research suggests that the primary health benefit from alcoholic beverages comes from the alcohol they contain.</p>
       <p>It is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a <!--del_lnk--> beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A recent study, however, found a link between <!--del_lnk--> binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high <!--del_lnk--> glycemic index of 110, the same as <!--del_lnk--> maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes <!--del_lnk--> metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.<br style="clear:both;" />

       <p>Around the world, there are a number of traditional and ancient starch-based beverages classed as beer. In Africa, there are various ethnic beers made from <a href="../../wp/s/Sorghum.htm" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a> or <!--del_lnk--> millet, such as <!--del_lnk--> Oshikundu in Namibia and <!--del_lnk--> Tella in Ethiopia. <a href="../../wp/k/Kyrgyzstan.htm" title="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a> also has a beer made from millet; it is a low alcohol, somewhat porridge-like drink called "Bozo". <a href="../../wp/b/Bhutan.htm" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, Nepal, <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sikkim.htm" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> also use millet in <!--del_lnk--> Chhaang, a popular semi-fermented rice/millet drink in the eastern <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalaya">Himalayas</a>. Further east in China are found <!--del_lnk--> Huangjiu and <!--del_lnk--> Choujiu&mdash;traditional rice-based beverages related to beer.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> in South America has <!--del_lnk--> Chicha, made from germinated maize (corn); while the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples in Brazil have <!--del_lnk--> Cauim, a traditional beverage made since pre-Columbian times by chewing <!--del_lnk--> manioc so that enzymes present in human saliva can break down the starch into fermentable sugars; this is similar to Masato in <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>.</p>
       <p>Some beers which are made from bread, which is linked to the earliest forms of beer, are <!--del_lnk--> Sahti in Finland, <!--del_lnk--> Kvass in Russia and <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Bouza in Sudan.</p>

       <p>Hops, and beer made with it, contain <!--del_lnk--> 8-prenylnaringenin which is a potent <!--del_lnk--> phytoestrogen.
