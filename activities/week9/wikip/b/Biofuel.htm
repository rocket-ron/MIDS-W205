       <p><b>Biofuel</b> can be broadly defined as solid, liquid, or gas <!--del_lnk--> fuel derived from recently dead <!--del_lnk--> biological material.This distinguishes it from <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a>, which are <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm#formation" title="Petroleum">derived from long dead biological material</a>. Biofuel can be theoretically produced from any (<a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biological</a>) carbon source, though the most common by far is <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a>. Many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture. Biofuels are used globally, most commonly to power <a href="#Liquid_fuels_for_transportation">vehicles</a> and cooking stoves. Biofuel industries are expanding in Europe, Asia and the Americas.</p>
       <p>Biofuels offer the possibility of producing energy without a net increase of carbon into the atmosphere because the plants used in to produce the fuel have <!--del_lnk--> removed CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, unlike fossil fuels which return carbon which was stored beneath the surface for millions of years into the air. Biofuel is therefore more nearly <!--del_lnk--> carbon neutral and less likely increase atmospheric concentrations of <a href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_gas.htm" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> (though doubts have been raised as to whether this benefit can be achieved in practice, <a href="../../wp/b/Biofuel.htm#Energy_efficiency_and_energy_balance_of_biofuels" title="Biofuel">see below</a>). The use of biofuels also reduces dependence on petroleum and enhances <!--del_lnk--> energy security.</p>
       <p>There are two common strategies of producing biofuels. One is to grow crops high in either sugar (<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sugarcane.htm" title="Sugar cane">sugar cane</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar_beet.htm" title="Sugar beet">sugar beet</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> sweet sorghum) or <!--del_lnk--> starch (<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Corn">corn</a>/<a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">maize</a>), and then use <a href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Yeast">yeast</a> fermentation to produce ethyl alcohol (<a href="../../wp/e/Ethanol.htm" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>). The second is to grow plants that contain high amounts of vegetable oil, such as <!--del_lnk--> oil palm, <a href="../../wp/s/Soybean.htm" title="Soybean">soybean</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Algae.htm" title="Algae">algae</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> jatropha. When these oils are heated, their <!--del_lnk--> viscosity is reduced, and they can be burned directly in a <!--del_lnk--> diesel engine, or the oils can be chemically processed to produce fuels such as <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiesel.htm" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a>. Wood and its byproducts can also be converted into biofuels such as <!--del_lnk--> woodgas, <a href="../../wp/m/Methanol.htm" title="Methanol">methanol</a> or <!--del_lnk--> ethanol fuel. It is also possible to make <!--del_lnk--> cellulosic ethanol from non-edible plant parts, but this can be difficult to accomplish economically.</p>
       <p>Biofuels are discussed as having significant roles in a variety of international issues, including: mitigation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_gas.htm" title="Carbon emissions">carbon emissions</a> levels and <!--del_lnk--> oil prices, the "<!--del_lnk--> food vs fuel" debate, <!--del_lnk--> deforestation and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Erosion.htm" title="Soil erosion">soil erosion</a>, impact on <a href="../../wp/w/Water_resources.htm" title="Water resources">water resources</a>, and energy balance and efficiency.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_and_policy">History and policy</span></h2>
       <p>Humans have used biomass fuels in the form of solid biofuels for heating and cooking since the discovery of fire. Following the discovery of electricity, it became possible to use biofuels to generate electrical power as well. However, the discovery and use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a>: <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">gas</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a>, have dramatically reduced the amount of biomass fuel used in the developed world for transport, heat and power. biofuels-p2.html National Geographic, <i>Green Dreams</i>, Oct 2007]</ref> However, when large <!--del_lnk--> supplies of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Crude oil">crude oil</a> were discovered in <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania and <!--del_lnk--> Texas, <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> based fuels became inexpensive, and soon were widely used. Cars and trucks began using fuels derived from <!--del_lnk--> mineral oil/<a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>: <!--del_lnk--> gasoline/<!--del_lnk--> petrol or <!--del_lnk--> diesel.</p>
       <p>Nevertheless, before <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and during the high demand wartime period, biofuels were valued as a strategic alternative to imported oil. Wartime Germany experienced extreme oil shortages, and many energy innovations resulted. This includes the powering of some of its vehicles using a blend of gasoline with alcohol fermented from potatoes, called <i>Monopolin</i>. In Britain, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Ethanol.htm" title="Grain alcohol">grain alcohol</a> was blended with <!--del_lnk--> petrol by the <!--del_lnk--> Distillers Company Limited under the name <i>Discol</i>, and marketed through <!--del_lnk--> Esso's affiliate Cleveland.</p>
       <p>During the peacetime post-war period, inexpensive oil from the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> contributed in part to the lessened economic and geopolitical interest in biofuels. Then in 1973 and 1979, geopolitical conflict in the Middle East caused <!--del_lnk--> OPEC to cut exports, and non-OPEC nations experienced a very large decrease in their oil <!--del_lnk--> supply. This "<!--del_lnk--> energy crisis" resulted in severe shortages, and a sharp increase in the prices of high <!--del_lnk--> demand oil-based products, notably <!--del_lnk--> petrol/<!--del_lnk--> gasoline. There was also increased interest from governments and academics in energy issues and biofuels. Throughout history, the fluctuations of <a href="../../wp/s/Supply_and_demand.htm" title="Supply and demand">supply and demand</a>, <!--del_lnk--> energy policy, <!--del_lnk--> military conflict, and the environmental impacts, have all contributed to a highly complex and volatile market for energy and fuel.</p>
       <p>In the year 2000 and beyond, renewed interest in biofuels has been seen. The drivers for biofuel <!--del_lnk--> research and development include rising oil prices, concerns over the potential <!--del_lnk--> oil peak, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_gas.htm" title="Greenhouse gas emission">greenhouse gas emissions</a> (causing <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Climate_change.htm" title="Climate change">climate change</a>), rural development interests, and instability in the Middle East.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biomass">Biomass</span></h2>
       <p>Biomass is material derived from recently living <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a>. This includes plants, animals and their by-products. For example, manure, garden waste and crop residues are all sources of biomass. It is a <a href="../../wp/r/Renewable_energy.htm" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> source based on the <!--del_lnk--> carbon cycle, unlike other <!--del_lnk--> natural resources such as <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fuels.</p>
       <p>Animal waste is a persistent and unavoidable pollutant produced primarily by the animals housed in industrial sized farms. Researchers from Washington University have figured out a way to turn manure into <!--del_lnk--> biomass. In April 2008 with the help of imaging technology they noticed that vigorous mixing helps microorganisms turn farm waste into alternative energy, providing farmers with a simple way to treat their waste and convert it into energy.</p>
       <p>There are also <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> products specifically grown for biofuel production include <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">corn</a>, <!--del_lnk--> switchgrass, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Soybean.htm" title="Soybeans">soybeans</a>, primarily in the United States; <!--del_lnk--> rapeseed, <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar_beet.htm" title="Sugar beet">sugar beet</a> primarily in Europe; <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sugarcane.htm" title="Sugar cane">sugar cane</a> in Brazil; <a href="../../wp/p/Palm_oil.htm" title="Palm oil">palm oil</a> and <!--del_lnk--> miscanthus in South-East Asia; <a href="../../wp/s/Sorghum.htm" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a> and <!--del_lnk--> cassava in China; and <!--del_lnk--> jatropha in India. <!--del_lnk--> Hemp has also been proven to work as a biofuel. <!--del_lnk--> Biodegradable outputs from industry, agriculture, forestry and households can be used for biofuel production, either using <!--del_lnk--> anaerobic digestion to produce <!--del_lnk--> biogas, or using <!--del_lnk--> second generation biofuels; examples include straw, timber, manure, rice husks, sewage, and food waste. The use of biomass fuels can therefore contribute to waste management as well as fuel security and help to prevent climate change, though alone they are not a comprehensive solution to these problems.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Using waste biomass to produce energy can reduce the use of fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce pollution and waste management problems. A recent publication by the European Union highlighted the potential for waste-derived bioenergy to contribute to the reduction of global warming. The report concluded that 19 million tons of oil equivalent is available from biomass by 2020, 46% from bio-wastes: municipal solid waste (MSW), agricultural residues, farm waste and other biodegradable waste streams.</p>
       <p>Landfill sites generate gases as the waste buried in them undergoes <!--del_lnk--> anaerobic digestion. These gases are known collectively as <!--del_lnk--> landfill gas (LFG). This can be burned and is considered a source of renewable energy, even though landfill disposal are often non-sustainable. Landfill gas can be burned either directly for heat or to generate <!--del_lnk--> electricity for public consumption. Landfill gas contains approximately 50% methane, the same gas that is found in <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>.</p>
       <p>Biomass can come from waste plant material. If landfill gas is not harvested, it escapes into the atmosphere: this is not desirable because methane is a greenhouse gas, with more <!--del_lnk--> global warming potential than carbon dioxide. Over a time span of 100 years, methane has a global warming potential of 23 relative to <b>CO<sub>2</sub></b>. Therefore, during this time, one ton of methane produces the same greenhouse gas (GHG) effect as 23 tons of <b>CO<sub>2</sub></b>. When methane burns the formula is <b>CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> = CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O</b> So by harvesting and burning landfill gas, its global warming potential is reduced a factor of 23, in addition to providing energy for <!--del_lnk--> heat and power.</p>
       <p>Frank Keppler and Thomas Rockmann discovered that living plants also produce methane <b>CH<sub>4</sub></b>. The amount of methane produced by living plants is 10 to 100 times greater than that produced by dead plants (in an aerobic environment) but does not increase global warming because of the <!--del_lnk--> carbon cycle.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Anaerobic digestion can be used as a distinct waste management strategy to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill and generate methane, or <!--del_lnk--> biogas. Any form of biomass can be used in <!--del_lnk--> anaerobic digestion and will break down to produce <a href="../../wp/m/Methane.htm" title="Methane">methane</a>, which can be harvested and burned to generate heat, power or to power certain automotive vehicles.</p>
       <p>A 3 MW landfill power plant would power 1,900 homes. It would eliminate 6,000 tons per year of methane from getting into the environment. It would eliminate 18,000 tons per year of <b>CO<sub>2</sub></b> from fossil fuel replacement. This is the same as removing 25,000 cars from the road, or planting 36,000 acres (146&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of forest, or not using 305,000 barrels (48,500&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of oil per year.</p>

       <p>Most transportation fuels are liquids, because vehicles usually require high <!--del_lnk--> energy density, as occurs in <a href="../../wp/l/Liquid.htm" title="Liquid">liquids</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Solid.htm" title="Solid">solids</a>. Vehicles usually need high <!--del_lnk--> power density as can be provided most inexpensively by an <!--del_lnk--> internal combustion engine.

The fuels that are easier to burn cleanly are typically liquids and <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gases</a>. Thus liquids (and gases that can be stored in liquid form) meet the requirements of being both portable and clean burning. Also, liquids and gases can be <a href="../../wp/p/Pump.htm" title="Pump">pumped</a>, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_biofuels">Types of biofuels</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_generation_biofuels">First generation biofuels</span></h3>
       <p>'First-generation biofuels' refer to biofuels made from <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, <!--del_lnk--> starch, <!--del_lnk--> vegetable oil, or <!--del_lnk--> animal fats using conventional technology. The basic feedstocks for the production of first generation biofuels are often seeds or grains such as wheat, which yields starch that is fermented into bioethanol, or sunflower seeds, which are pressed to yield vegetable oil that can be used in biodiesel. These feedstocks could also enter the animal or human food chain, and as the global population has risen their use in producing biofuels has been criticised for diverting food away from the human food chain, leading to food shortages and price rises.</p>
       <p>The most common first generation biofuels are listed below.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vegetable_oil">Vegetable oil</span></h4>
       <p>Vegetable oil can be used for either food or fuel; the quality of the oil may be lower for fuel use. Vegetable oil can be used in many older diesel engines (equipped with <!--del_lnk--> indirect injection systems), but only in warm climates. In most cases, vegetable oil is used to manufacture biodiesel, which is compatible with most diesel engines when blended with conventional diesel fuel. <!--del_lnk--> MAN B&amp;W Diesel, <!--del_lnk--> Wartsila and <!--del_lnk--> Deutz AG offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, and at a smaller scale, cleaned of water and particulates and used as a fuel.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Biodiesel">Biodiesel</span></h4>
       <p>Biodiesel is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using <!--del_lnk--> transesterification and is a liquid similar in composition to mineral diesel. Its chemical name is fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) ester (<!--del_lnk--> FAME). Oils are mixed with sodium hydroxide and methanol (or ethanol) and the chemical reaction produces biodiesel (FAME) and <!--del_lnk--> glycerol. One part glycerol is produced for every 10 parts biodiesel. Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Soybean.htm" title="Soy">soy</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rapeseed, <!--del_lnk--> jatropha, <!--del_lnk--> mahua, <a href="../../wp/m/Mustard_plant.htm" title="Mustard plant">mustard</a>, <!--del_lnk--> flax, <a href="../../wp/s/Sunflower.htm" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Palm_oil.htm" title="Palm oil">palm oil</a>, <!--del_lnk--> hemp, <!--del_lnk--> field pennycress, and <!--del_lnk--> algae.</p>
       <p>Biodiesel can be used in any <!--del_lnk--> diesel engine when mixed with mineral diesel. In some countries manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for 100% biodiesel use, although Volkswagen of Germany, for example, asks drivers to make a telephone check with the VW environmental services department before switching to 100% biodiesel (see <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiesel.htm#Use" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel use</a>). Many people have run their vehicles on biodiesel without problems, although it can become thick/viscous at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used, and vehicles may require fuel line heaters. However, the majority of vehicle manufacturers limit their recommendations to 15% biodiesel blended with mineral diesel. Many newer diesel engines are made so that they can run with 100% biodiesel fuel without altering the engine itself, although this can be dependent on the fuel rail design. Since biodiesels burn cleaner than regular mineral diesel, filters may need to be replaced more often, especially as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.</p>
       <p>In the USA, more than 80% of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel. Therefore "the nascent U.S. market for biodiesel is growing at a staggering rate&mdash;from 25 million gallons per year in 2004 to 78 million gallons by the beginning of 2005. By the end of 2006 biodiesel production was estimated to increase fourfold to more than 1 billion gallons," energy expert <!--del_lnk--> Will Thurmond writes in an article for the July-August 2007 issue of <!--del_lnk--> THE FUTURIST magazine.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Butanol is formed by <!--del_lnk--> ABE fermentation (acetone, butanol, ethanol) and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high net energy gains with butanol as the only liquid product.

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Ethanol fuel is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly <!--del_lnk--> in Brazil. <!--del_lnk--> Alcohol fuels are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Corn">corn</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar_beet.htm" title="Sugar beet">sugar beets</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sugarcane.htm" title="Sugar cane">sugar cane</a>, <!--del_lnk--> molasses and any sugar or starch that <!--del_lnk--> alcoholic beverages can be made from (like <a href="../../wp/p/Potato.htm" title="Potato">potato</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruit</a> waste, etc.). The <a href="../../wp/e/Ethanol.htm" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> production methods used are <!--del_lnk--> enzyme digestion (to release sugars from stored starches, <!--del_lnk--> fermentation of the sugars, <a href="../../wp/d/Distillation.htm" title="Distillation">distillation</a> and <!--del_lnk--> drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (often unsustainable <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a>, but cellulosic biomass such as <!--del_lnk--> bagasse, the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, can also be used more sustainably).</p>
       <p>Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for <!--del_lnk--> gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing automobile petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Gasoline with ethanol added has higher <!--del_lnk--> octane, which means that your engine can typically burn hotter and more efficiently. In high altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter <!--del_lnk--> oxidizer to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Ethanol fuel has less <!--del_lnk--> BTU energy content, which means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to go the same distance. More-expensive premium fuels contain less, or no, ethanol. In high-compression engines, less ethanol, slower-burning premium fuel is required to avoid harmful <!--del_lnk--> pre-ignition (knocking). Very-expensive aviation gasoline (Avgas) is 100 octane made from 100% petroleum. The high price of zero-ethanol Avgas does not include federal-and-state road-use taxes.</p>
       <p>Ethanol is very <!--del_lnk--> corrosive to fuel systems, rubber hoses-and-gaskets, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Aluminium.htm" title="Aluminum">aluminium</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> combustion chambers. It is therefore illegal to use fuels containing alcohol in aircraft (although at least one model of ethanol-powered aircraft has been developed, the <!--del_lnk--> Embraer EMB 202 Ipanema). Ethanol is incompatible with marine fibreglass fuel tanks (it makes them leak). For higher ethanol percentage blends, and 100% ethanol vehicles, engine modifications are required.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Corrosive ethanol cannot be transported in petroleum pipelines, so more-expensive over-the-road stainless-steel tank trucks increase the cost and energy consumption required to deliver ethanol to the customer at the pump.</p>
       <p>In the current alcohol-from-corn production model in the United States, considering the total energy consumed by <!--del_lnk--> farm equipment, cultivation, planting, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizers">fertilizers</a>, <!--del_lnk--> pesticides, <!--del_lnk--> herbicides, and <!--del_lnk--> fungicides made from petroleum, <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> systems, harvesting, transport of feedstock to processing plants, <!--del_lnk--> fermentation, <a href="../../wp/d/Distillation.htm" title="Distillation">distillation</a>, drying, transport to fuel terminals and retail pumps, and lower <!--del_lnk--> ethanol fuel energy content, the net energy content value added and delivered to consumers is very small. And, the net benefit (all things considered) does little to reduce un-<!--del_lnk--> sustainable imported oil and fossil fuels required to produce the ethanol.</p>
       <p>Many car manufacturers are now producing <!--del_lnk--> flexible-fuel vehicles (FFV's), which can safely run on any combination of bioethanol and petrol, up to 100% bioethanol. They dynamically sense exhaust oxygen content, and adjust the engine's computer systems, spark, and fuel injection accordingly. This adds initial cost and ongoing increased vehicle maintenance. Efficiency falls and pollution emissions increase when FFV system maintenance is needed (regardless of the 0%-to-100% ethanol mix being used), but not performed (as with all vehicles). FFV <!--del_lnk--> internal combustion engines are becoming increasingly complex, as are multiple-<!--del_lnk--> propulsion-system FFV <!--del_lnk--> hybrid vehicles, which impacts cost, maintenance, <!--del_lnk--> reliability, and useful lifetime <!--del_lnk--> longevity.</p>
       <p>Alcohol mixes with both petroleum and with water, so <!--del_lnk--> ethanol fuels are often diluted after the drying process by absorbing environmental moisture from the atmosphere. Water in alcohol-mix fuels reduces efficiency, makes engines harder to start, causes intermittent operation (sputtering), and oxidizes aluminium (<!--del_lnk--> carburetors) and steel components (<!--del_lnk--> rust).</p>
       <p>Even dry ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline, so larger / heavier fuel tanks are required to travel the same distance, or more fuel stops are required. With large current un-<!--del_lnk--> sustainable, non-<!--del_lnk--> scalable subsidies, <!--del_lnk--> ethanol fuel still costs much more per unit of distance traveled than current high gasoline prices in the United States.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/m/Methanol.htm" title="Methanol">Methanol</a> is currently produced from <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>, a non-<!--del_lnk--> renewable <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a>.

       <p>Biogas is produced by the process of <!--del_lnk--> anaerobic digestion of <!--del_lnk--> organic material by <!--del_lnk--> anaerobes. It can be produced either from biodegradable waste materials or by the use of <!--del_lnk--> energy crops fed into <!--del_lnk--> anaerobic digesters to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct, <!--del_lnk--> digestate, can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer. In the UK, the National Coal Board experimented with microorganisms that digested coal in situ converting it directly to gases such as methane.</p>
       <p>Biogas contains <a href="../../wp/m/Methane.htm" title="Methane">methane</a> and can be recovered from industrial anaerobic digesters and <!--del_lnk--> mechanical biological treatment systems. Landfill gas is a less clean form of biogas which is produced in <!--del_lnk--> landfills through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere it is a potent <a href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_gas.htm" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a>.</p>

       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Syngas">Syngas</span></h4>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Syngas is produced by the combined processes of <!--del_lnk--> pyrolysis, combustion, and <!--del_lnk--> gasification. Biofuel is converted into <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_monoxide.htm" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> and energy by pyrolysis. A limited supply of oxygen is introduced to support combustion. Gasification converts further organic material to hydrogen and additional carbon monoxide.</p>
       <p>The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is itself a fuel. Using the syngas is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.</p>
       <p>Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines. The <!--del_lnk--> wood gas generator is a wood-fueled gasification reactor mounted on an internal combustion engine. Syngas can be used to produce <a href="../../wp/m/Methanol.htm" title="Methanol">methanol</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, or converted via the <!--del_lnk--> Fischer-Tropsch process to produce a synthetic <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> substitute.

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Second_generation_biofuels">Second generation biofuels</span></h3>
       <p>Supporters of biofuels claim that a more viable solution is to increase political and industrial support for, and rapidity of, second-generation biofuel implementation from <!--del_lnk--> non food crops, including <!--del_lnk--> cellulosic biofuels. Second-generation biofuel production processes can use a variety of <!--del_lnk--> non food crops. These include waste biomass, the stalks of wheat, corn, wood, and special-energy-or-biomass crops (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Miscanthus). Second generation (2G) biofuels use <!--del_lnk--> biomass to liquid technology, including <!--del_lnk--> cellulosic biofuels from <!--del_lnk--> non food crops. Many second generation biofuels are under development such as <!--del_lnk--> biohydrogen, <!--del_lnk--> biomethanol, <!--del_lnk--> DMF, Bio-DME, <!--del_lnk--> Fischer-Tropsch diesel, biohydrogen diesel, mixed alcohols and wood diesel.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Cellulosic ethanol production uses <!--del_lnk--> non food crops or inedible waste products and does not divert food away from the animal or human food chain. <!--del_lnk--> Lignocellulose is the "woody" structural material of plants. This feedstock is abundant and diverse, and in some cases (like citrus peels or sawdust) it is a significant disposal problem.</p>
       <p>Producing <a href="../../wp/e/Ethanol.htm" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> from <!--del_lnk--> cellulose is a difficult technical problem to solve. In nature, <!--del_lnk--> Ruminant livestock (like <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a>) eat grass and then use slow enzymatic digestive processes to break it into <a href="../../wp/g/Glucose.htm" title="Glucose">glucose</a> (sugar).

American food exports have decreased (increasing grain prices worldwide), and US food imports have increased significantly.</p>
       <p>Most biofuels are not currently cost-effective without significant subsidies. "America's ethanol program is a product of government subsidies.

The raw materials can be as simple as corn stalks and scrap petroleum-based vehicle tires, but used tires are an expensive feedstock with other more-valuable uses. GM has over 4 million E85 cars on the road now, and by 2012 half of the production cars for the U.S. will be capable of running on E85 fuel, however by 2012 the supply of ethanol will not even be close to supplying this much E85. Coskata Inc. is building two new plants for the ethanol fuel. Theoretically, the process is claimed to be five times more energy efficient than corn based ethanol, however it is still in development and has not been proven to be cost effective in a free market.</p>
       <p>The greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 86% for cellulose compared to corn&rsquo;s 29% reduction.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biofuels_in_developing_countries">Biofuels in developing countries</span></h3>
       <p>Biofuel industries are becoming established in many developing countries. Many developing countries have extensive biomass resources that are becoming more valuable as demand for biomass and biofuels increases. The approaches to biofuel development in different parts of the world varies. Countries such as India and China are developing both bioethanol and biodiesel programs. India is extending plantations of <!--del_lnk--> jatropha, an oil-producing tree that is used in biodiesel production. The Indian sugar ethanol program sets a target of 5% bioethanol incorporation into transport fuel. China is a major bioethanol producer and aims to incorporate 15% bioethanol into transport fuels by 2010. Costs of biofuel promotion programs can be very high, though.</p>
       <p>Amongst rural populations in developing countries, biomass provides the majority of fuel for heat and cooking. Wood, animal dung and crop residues are commonly burned. Figures from the International Energy Agency show that biomass energy provides around 30% of the total primary energy supply in developing countries; over 2 billion people depend on biomass fuels as their primary energy source.</p>
       <p>The use of biomass fuels for cooking indoors is a source of health problems and pollution. 1.3 million deaths were attributed to the use of biomass fuels with inadequate ventilation by the <!--del_lnk--> International Energy Agency in its World Energy Outlook 2006. Proposed solutions include improved stoves and alternative fuels. However, fuels are easily damaged, and alternative fuels tend to be expensive. Very low cost, fuel efficient, low pollution biomass stove designs have existed since 1980 or earlier. Issues are a lack of education, distribution, excess corruption, and very low levels of foreign aid. People in <!--del_lnk--> developing countries are often unable to afford these solutions without assistance or financing such as <!--del_lnk--> microloans. Organizations such as <!--del_lnk--> Intermediate Technology Development Group work to make improved facilities for biofuel use and better alternatives accessible to those who cannot get them.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Current_issues_in_biofuel_production_and_use">Current issues in biofuel production and use</span></h2>
       <p>Biofuels are proposed as having such benefits as: reduction of <a href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_gas.htm" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions, reduction of <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> use, increased national <!--del_lnk--> energy security, increased <!--del_lnk--> rural development and a sustainable fuel supply for the future.</p>
       <p>However, biofuel production is questioned from a number of angles. The chairman of the <!--del_lnk--> International Panel on Climate Change, <!--del_lnk--> Rajendra Pachauri, notably observed in March 2008 that questions arise on the emissions implications of that route, and that biofuel production has clearly raised prices of corn, with an overall implication for food security.</p>
       <p>Biofuels are also seen as having limitations. The feedstocks for biofuel production must be replaced rapidly and biofuel production processes must be designed and implemented so as to supply the maximum amount of fuel at the cheapest cost, while providing maximum environmental benefits. Broadly speaking, first generation biofuel production processes cannot supply us with more than a few percent of our energy requirements sustainably. The reasons for this are described below. Second generation processes can supply us with more biofuel, with better environmental gains. The major barrier to the development of second generation biofuel processes is their capital cost: establishing second generation biodiesel plants has been estimated at &euro;500million.</p>
       <p>Recently, an inflexion point about advantages/disadvantages of biofuels seems to be gaining momentum. The March 27, 2008 <!--del_lnk--> TIME magazine cover features the subject under the title "The Clean Energy Myth":</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>Politicians and Big Business are pushing biofuels like corn-based ethanol as alternatives to oil. All they&rsquo;re really doing is driving up world food prices, helping to destroy the Amazon jungle, and making global warming worse.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In the June, 2008 issue of the journal Conservation Biology, scientists argue that because such large amounts of energy are required to grow corn and convert it to ethanol, the net energy gain of the resulting fuel is modest. Using a crop such as switchgrass, common forage for cattle, would require much less energy to produce the fuel, and using algae would require even less. Changing direction to biofuels based on switchgrass or algae would require significant policy changes, since the technologies to produce such fuels are not fully developed.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oil_price_moderation">Oil price moderation</span></h3>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> International Energy Agency's <i>World Energy Outlook 2006</i> concludes that rising oil demand, if left unchecked, would accentuate the consuming countries' vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting price shock. The report suggested that biofuels may one day offer a viable alternative, but also that "the implications of the use of biofuels for global security as well as for economic, environmental, and public health need to be further evaluated".</p>
       <p>Economists disagree on the extent that biofuel production affects crude oil prices. According to the Francisco Blanch, a commodity strategist for Merrill Lynch, crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels. Gordon Quaiattini, president of the Canadian Renewable Fuels Association, argued that a healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes. However, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas concluded that "Biofuels are too limited in scale and currently too costly to make much difference to crude oil pricing."</p>

       <p>This topic is internationally controversial. There are those, such as the National Corn Growers Association, who say biofuel is not the main cause. Some say the problem is a result of government actions to support biofuels. Others say it is just due to oil price increases. The impact of food price increases is greatest on poorer countries. Some have called for a freeze on biofuels. Some have called for more funding of second generation biofuels which should not compete with food production so much. In May 2008 Olivier de Schutter, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> food adviser, called for a halt on biofuel investment. In an interview in <i><!--del_lnk--> Le Monde</i> he stated: "The ambitious goals for biofuel production set by the United States and the European Union are irresponsible. I am calling for a freeze on all investment in this sector." 100 million people are currently at risk due to the food price increases.</p>

       <p>Biofuels and other forms of <a href="../../wp/r/Renewable_energy.htm" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> aim to be <!--del_lnk--> carbon neutral or even carbon negative. Carbon neutral means that the carbon released during the use of the fuel, e.g. through burning to power transport or generate electricity, is reabsorbed and balanced by the carbon absorbed by new plant growth. These plants are then harvested to make the next batch of fuel. <!--del_lnk--> Carbon neutral fuels lead to no net increases in human contributions to atmospheric <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> levels, reducing the human contributions to <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. A carbon negative aim is achieved when a portion of the biomass is used for <!--del_lnk--> carbon sequestration. Calculating exactly how much <a href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_gas.htm" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> (GHG) is produced in burning biofuels is a complex and inexact process, which depends very much on the method by which the fuel is produced and other assumptions made in the calculation.</p>
       <p>Carbon emissions have been increasing ever since the industrial revolution. Prior to the industrial revolution, our atmosphere contained about 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide. After burning coal, gas, and oil to power our lives, the concentration had risen to 315 parts per million. Today, it is at the 380 level and still increasing by approximately two parts per million annually. During this time frame, the global average temperature has risen by more than 1&deg;F since carbon dioxide traps heat near the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Scientists believe that if the level goes beyond 450 parts per million, the temperature jump will be so great that we will be faced with an enormous rise in sea level due to the melting of Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets.</p>
       <p>The carbon emissions (<!--del_lnk--> Carbon footprint) produced by biofuels are calculated using a technique called <!--del_lnk--> Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). This uses a "cradle to grave" or "well to wheels" approach to calculate the total amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted during biofuel production, from putting seed in the ground to using the fuel in cars and trucks. Many different LCAs have been done for different biofuels, with widely differing results. The majority of LCA studies show that biofuels provide significant greenhouse gas emissions savings when compared to fossil fuels such as petroleum and diesel. Therefore, using biofuels to replace a proportion of the fossil fuels that are burned for transportation can reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. The <!--del_lnk--> well-to-wheel analysis for biofuels has shown that first generation biofuels can save up to 60% carbon emission and second generation biofuels can save up to 80% as opposed to using fossil fuels. However these studies do not take into account emissions from nitrogen fixation, deforestation, land use, or any indirect emissions.</p>
       <p>In October 2007, a study was published by scientists from Britain, U.S., Germany and Austria, including Professor <!--del_lnk--> Paul Crutzen, who won a Nobel Prize for his work on ozone. They reported that the burning of biofuels derived from <!--del_lnk--> rapeseed and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Corn">corn</a> (maize) can contribute as much or more to global warming by <!--del_lnk--> nitrous oxide emissions than cooling by fossil fuel savings. Nitrous oxide is both a potent greenhouse gas and a destroyer of atmospheric ozone. But they also reported that crops with lower requirements for <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>, such as grasses and woody <!--del_lnk--> coppicing will result in a net absorption of greenhouse gases.</p>
       <p>In February 2008, two articles were published in <!--del_lnk--> Science which investigated the GHG emissions effects of the large amount of natural land that is being converted to cropland globally to support biofuels development. The first of these studies, conducted at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Minnesota, found that:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>...converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food-based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a &lsquo;biofuel carbon debt&rsquo; by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO<sub>2</sub> than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions these biofuels provide by displacing fossil fuels.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>This study not only takes into account removal of the original vegetation (as timber or by burning) but also the biomass present in the soil, for example roots, which is released on continued plowing. It also pointed out that:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>...biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on degraded and abandoned agricultural lands planted with perennials incur little or no carbon debt and can offer immediate and sustained GHG advantages.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>The second study, conducted at <a href="../../wp/p/Princeton_University.htm" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>, used a worldwide agricultural model to show that:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>...corn-based ethanol, instead of producing a 20% savings, nearly doubles greenhouse emissions over 30 years and increases greenhouse gases for 167 years.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Both of the Science studies highlight the need for <!--del_lnk--> sustainable biofuels, using feedstocks that minimize competition for prime croplands. These include farm, forest and municipal waste streams; energy crops grown on marginal lands, and algaes. These second generation biofuels feedstocks "are expected to dramatically reduce GHGs compared to first generation biofuels such as corn ethanol". In short, biofuels done unsustainably could make the climate problem worse, while biofuels done sustainably could play a leading role in solving the carbon challenge.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sustainable_biofuel_production">Sustainable biofuel production</span></h3>
       <p>Responsible policies and economic instruments would help to ensure that biofuel commercialization, including the development of new <!--del_lnk--> cellulosic technologies, is <!--del_lnk--> sustainable. Sustainable biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would actually enhance soil fertitlity. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and impoverished Asia.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Soil_erosion.2C_deforestation.2C_and_biodiversity">Soil erosion, deforestation, and biodiversity</span></h3>
       <p>It is important to note that <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> compounds in waste <!--del_lnk--> biomass that is left on the ground are consumed by other <!--del_lnk--> microorganisms. They break down <!--del_lnk--> biomass in the soil to produce valuable <a href="../../wp/n/Nutrient.htm" title="Nutrient">nutrients</a> that are necessary for future crops. On a larger scale, plant biomass waste provides small wildlife <!--del_lnk--> habitat, which in turn ripples up through the food chain. The widespread human use of biomass (which would normally <!--del_lnk--> compost the field) would threaten these organisms and natural habitats. When <!--del_lnk--> cellulosic ethanol is produced from feedstock like <!--del_lnk--> switchgrass and <!--del_lnk--> saw grass, the nutrients that were required to grow the <!--del_lnk--> lignocellulose are removed and cannot be processed by microorganisms to replenish the soil nutrients. The soil is then of poorer quality. Loss of ground cover root structures accelerates unsustainable <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Erosion.htm" title="Soil erosion">soil erosion</a>.</p>
       <p>Significant areas of native <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_rainforest.htm" title="Amazon rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a> have been cleared by <!--del_lnk--> slash and burn techniques to make room for <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sugarcane.htm" title="Sugar cane">sugar cane</a> production, which is used in large part for <!--del_lnk--> ethanol fuel in Brazil, and growing <a href="../../wp/e/Ethanol.htm" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> exports.

       <p>A portion of the biomass should be retained onsite to support the soil resource. Normally this will be in the form of raw biomass, but processed biomass is also an option. If the exported biomass is used to produce <!--del_lnk--> syngas, the process can be used to co-produce <!--del_lnk--> biochar, a low-temperature charcoal used as a soil amendment to increase soil organic matter to a degree not practical with less recalcitrant forms of organic carbon. For co-production of biochar to be widely adopted, the soil amendment and carbon sequestration value of co-produced charcoal must exceed its net value as a source of energy.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aldehydes">Aldehydes</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Formaldehyde, <!--del_lnk--> Acetaldehyde and other <!--del_lnk--> Aldehydes are produced when alcohols are <!--del_lnk--> oxidized. When only a 10% mixture of ethanol is added to gasoline (as is common in American <!--del_lnk--> E10 <!--del_lnk--> gasohol and elsewhere), aldehyde emissions increase 40%. Some study results are conflicting on this fact however, and lowering the sulfur content of biofuel mixes lowers the acetaldehyde levels. Burning biodiesel also emits aldehydes and other potentially hazardous aromatic compounds which are not regulated in emissions laws.</p>
       <p>Many aldehydes are toxic to living cells. Formaldehyde irreversibly cross-links <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Amino_acid.htm" title="Amino acids">amino acids</a>, which produces the hard flesh of embalmed bodies. At high concentrations in an enclosed space, formaldehyde can be a significant respiratory irritant causing nose bleeds, respiratory distress, lung disease, and persistent headaches. Acetaldehyde, which is produced in the body by alcohol drinkers and found in the mouths of smokers and those with poor oral hygene, is carcinogenic and <!--del_lnk--> mutagenic.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> has banned products that contain <!--del_lnk--> Formaldehyde, due to its documented <!--del_lnk--> carcinogenic characteristics.

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_and_Water_impact_in_Indonesia">Social and Water impact in Indonesia</span></h3>
       <p>In some locations such as Indonesia deforestation for Palm Oil plantations is leading to displacement of Indigenous peoples. Also, extensive use of pesticide for biofuel crops is reducing clean water supplies.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_organizations_stance">Environmental organizations stance</span></h3>
       <p>Some mainstream environmental groups support biofuels as a significant step toward slowing or stopping global climate change. However, biofuel production can threaten the environment if it is not done sustainably. This finding has been backed by reports of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="UN">UN</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> IPCC, and some other smaller environmental and social groups as the <!--del_lnk--> EEB and the Bank Sarasin, which generally remain negative about biofuels.</p>
       <p>As a result, governmental and environmental organisations are turning against biofuels made at a non-sustainable way (hereby preferring certain oil sources as <!--del_lnk--> jatropha and <!--del_lnk--> lignocellulose over <a href="../../wp/p/Palm_oil.htm" title="Palm oil">palm oil</a>) and are asking for global support for this. Also, besides supporting these more sustainable biofuels, environmental organisations are redirecting to new technologies that do not use <!--del_lnk--> internal combustion engines such as <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen and compressed air.</p>
       <p>The "Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels" is an international initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, the Roundtable is developing a series of principles and criteria for <!--del_lnk--> sustainable biofuels production through meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions.</p>
       <p>The increased manufacture of biofuels will require increasing land areas to be used for agriculture. Second and third generation biofuel processes can ease the pressure on land, because they can use waste biomass, and existing (untapped) sources of biomass such as crop residues and potentially even marine algae.</p>
       <p>In some regions of the world, a combination of increasing demand for food, and increasing demand for biofuel, is causing deforestation and threats to biodiversity. The best reported example of this is the expansion of oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, where rainforest is being destroyed to establish new oil palm plantations. It is an important fact that 90% of the palm oil produced in Malaysia is used by the food industry; therefore biofuels cannot be held solely responsible for this deforestation. There is a pressing need for sustainable palm oil production for the food and fuel industries; palm oil is used in a wide variety of food products. The <i>Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels</i> is working to define criteria, standards and processes to promote sustainably produced biofuels. Palm oil is also used in the manufacture of detergents, and in electricity and heat generation both in Asia and around the world (the UK burns palm oil in coal-fired power stations to generate electricity).</p>
       <p>Significant area is likely to be dedicated to sugar cane in future years as demand for ethanol increases worldwide. The expansion of sugar cane plantations will place pressure on environmentally-sensitive native ecosystems including rainforest in South America. In forest ecosystems, these effects themselves will undermine the climate benefits of alternative fuels, in addition to representing a major threat to global biodiversity.</p>
       <p>Although biofuels are generally considered to improve net carbon output, biodiesel and other fuels do produce local air pollution, including <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen oxides, the principal cause of <a href="../../wp/s/Smog.htm" title="Smog">smog</a>.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Potential_for_poverty_reduction">Potential for poverty reduction</span></h3>
       <p>Researchers at the <!--del_lnk--> Overseas Development Institute have argued that biofuels could help to reduce poverty in the developing world, through increased <a href="../../wp/e/Employment.htm" title="Employment">employment</a>, wider <!--del_lnk--> economic growth multipliers and energy price effects. However, this potential is described as 'fragile', and is reduced where feedstock production tends to be large scale, or causes pressure on limited agricultural resources: capital investment, land, water, and the net cost of food for the poor.</p>
       <p>With regards to the potential for poverty reduction or exacerbation, biofuels rely on many of the same policy, regulatory or investment shortcomings that impede <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> as a route to <!--del_lnk--> poverty reduction. Since many of these shortcomings require policy improvements at a country level rather than a global one, they argue for a country-by-country analysis of the potential poverty impacts of biofuels. This would consider, among other things, land administration systems, market coordination and prioritising investment in <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiesel.htm" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a>, as this 'generates more labour, has lower transportation costs and uses simpler technology'.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biofuel_prices">Biofuel prices</span></h3>
       <p>Retail, at the pump prices, including U.S. subsidies, Federal and state <!--del_lnk--> motor taxes, B2/B5 prices for low-level Biodiesel (B2-B5) are lower than <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> diesel by about 12 cents, and B20 blends are the same per unit of volume as petrodiesel.</p>
       <p>Due to the 1/3 lower energy content of <!--del_lnk--> ethanol fuel, even the heavily-subsidized net cost to drive a specific distance in <!--del_lnk--> flexible-fuel vehicles is higher than current gasoline prices.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_efficiency_and_energy_balance_of_biofuels">Energy efficiency and energy balance of biofuels</span></h3>
       <p>Production of biofuels from raw materials requires <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> (for farming, transport and conversion to final product, and the production / application of <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>, <!--del_lnk--> pesticides, <!--del_lnk--> herbicides, and <!--del_lnk--> fungicides), and has environmental consequences.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> energy balance of a biofuel is determined by the amount of energy put into the manufacture of fuel compared to the amount of energy released when it is burned in a vehicle. This varies by feedstock and according to the assumptions used. Biodiesel made from sunflowers may produce only 0.46 times the input rate of fuel energy. Biodiesel made from soybeans may produce 3.2 times the input rate of fossil fuels. This compares to 0.805 for gasoline and 0.843 for diesel made from petroleum. Biofuels may require higher energy input per unit of <!--del_lnk--> BTU energy content produced than <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a>: petroleum can be pumped out of the ground and processed more efficiently than biofuels can be grown and processed. However, this is not necessarily a reason to use oil instead of biofuels, nor does it have an impact on the environmental benefits provided by a given biofuel.</p>
       <p>Studies have been done that calculate energy balances for biofuel production. Some of these show large differences depending on the biomass feedstock used and location.</p>
       <p>To explain one specific example, a <!--del_lnk--> June 17, <a href="../../wp/2/2006.htm" title="2006">2006</a> editorial in the Wall. St. Journal stated, "The most widely cited research on this subject comes from Cornell's David Pimental and Berkeley's Ted Patzek. They've found that it takes more than a gallon of fossil fuel to make one gallon of ethanol &mdash; 29% more. That's because it takes enormous amounts of fossil-fuel energy to grow corn (using fertilizer and irrigation), to transport the crops and then to turn that corn into ethanol."</p>
       <p>Life cycle assessments of biofuel production show that under certain circumstances, biofuels produce only limited savings in energy and greenhouse gas emissions. Fertiliser inputs and transportation of biomass across large distances can reduce the GHG savings achieved. The location of biofuel processing plants can be planned to minimize the need for transport, and agricultural regimes can be developed to limit the amount of fertiliser used for biomass production. A European study on the greenhouse gas emissions found that <!--del_lnk--> well-to-wheel (WTW) CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of biodiesel from seed crops such as <!--del_lnk--> rapeseed could be almost as high as fossil diesel. It showed a similar result for bio-ethanol from starch crops, which could have almost as many WTW CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as fossil petrol. This study showed that second generation biofuels have far lower WTW CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
       <p>Other independent LCA studies show that biofuels save around 50% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the equivalent fossil fuels. This can be increased to 80-90% GHG emissions savings if second generation processes or reduced fertiliser growing regimes are used. Further GHG savings can be achieved by using by-products to provide heat, such as using <!--del_lnk--> bagasse to power ethanol production from sugarcane.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Collocation of <!--del_lnk--> synergistic processing plants can enhance efficiency. One example is to use the exhaust heat from an industrial process for ethanol production, which can then <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Recycling.htm" title="Recycle">recycle</a> cooler processing water, instead of evaporating hot water that warms the atmosphere.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biofuels_and_solar_energy_efficiency">Biofuels and solar energy efficiency</span></h3>
       <p>Biofuels from plant materials convert energy that was originally captured from <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_energy.htm" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> via <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. A comparison of conversion efficiency from solar to usable energy (taking into account the whole energy budgets) shows that <!--del_lnk--> photovoltaics are 100 times more efficient than <!--del_lnk--> corn ethanol and 10 times more efficient than the best biofuel.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Centralised_vs._decentralised_production">Centralised vs. decentralised production</span></h3>
       <p>There is debate around the best model for production.</p>
       <p>One side sees centralised vegetable oil fuel production offering</p>
       <ul>
        <li>efficiency</li>
        <li>greater potential for fuel standardisation</li>
        <li>ease of administrating taxes</li>
        <li>possibility for rapid expansion</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The other side of the argument points to</p>
       <ul>
        <li>increased fuel security</li>
        <li>rural job creation</li>
        <li>less of a '<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Monopoly.htm" title="Monopolistic">monopolistic</a>' or '<!--del_lnk--> oligopolistic' market due to the increased number of producers</li>
        <li>benefits to local economy as a greater part of any profits stay in the local economy</li>
        <li>decreased transportation and <a href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_gas.htm" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> of feedstock and end product</li>
        <li>consumers close to and able to observe the effects of production</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The majority of established biofuel markets have followed the centralised model with a few small or micro producers holding a minor segment of the market. A noticeable exception to this has been the pure plant oil (PPO) market in Germany which grew exponentially until the beginning of 2008 when increasing feedstock prices and the introduction of fuel duty combined to stifle the market. Fuel was produced in hundreds of small oil mills distributed throughout Germany often run as part of farm businesses.</p>
       <p>Initially fuel quality could be variable but as the market matured new technologies were developed that made significantly improvements. As the technologies surrounding this fuel improved usage and production rapidly increased with rapeseed oil PPO forming a significant segment of transportation biofuels consumed in 2007.</p>
