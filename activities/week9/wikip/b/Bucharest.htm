       <p><b>Bucharest</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Romanian: <span lang="ro" xml:lang="ro"><i>Bucure&#x219;ti</i></span>; <!--del_lnk--> names in other languages) is the capital municipality, cultural, industrial, and financial centre of <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a>. It is the largest city in Romania, located in the southeast of the country, at <span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><!--del_lnk--> <span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">44&deg;25&prime;57&Prime;N</span> <span class="longitude">26&deg;06&prime;14&Prime;E</span></span></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span id="coordinates"><!--del_lnk--> Coordinates: <span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><!--del_lnk--> <span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">44&deg;25&prime;57&Prime;N</span> <span class="longitude">26&deg;06&prime;14&Prime;E</span></span></span></span></span></span>, lies on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> D&acirc;mbovi&#x21B;a River, less than 70 kilometres (43&nbsp;mi) north of the Danube.</p>
       <p>Bucharest was first mentioned in documents in 1459. It became the capital of Romania in 1862 and is the centre of Romanian media, culture and art. Its architecture is a mix of historical (<!--del_lnk--> neo-classical), <!--del_lnk--> interbellum (<!--del_lnk--> Bauhaus and <!--del_lnk--> Art Deco), Communist-era and modern. In the period between the two World Wars, the city's elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of "Little Paris" (<i>Micul Paris</i>). Although buildings and districts in the historic city centre were heavily damaged or destroyed by war, earthquakes, and above all <!--del_lnk--> Ceau&#x219;escu's program of <!--del_lnk--> systematization, many survived. In recent years, the city has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom.</p>
       <p>According to preliminary data from <!--del_lnk--> 2011 census, 1,677,985 inhabitants live within the city limits, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census. The <!--del_lnk--> urban area extends beyond the limits of Bucharest proper and has a population of 1.93&nbsp;million people. Adding the satellite towns around the urban area, the proposed <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area of Bucharest would have a population of 2.2&nbsp;million people. According to <!--del_lnk--> Eurostat, Bucharest has a <!--del_lnk--> Larger Urban Zone of 2,151,880 residents. According to unofficial data, the population is more than 3 million. Bucharest is the 10th <!--del_lnk--> largest city in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> by population within city limits.</p>
       <p>Economically, Bucharest is the most prosperous city in Romania and is one of the main industrial centres and transportation hubs of Eastern Europe. The city has big convention facilities, educational institutes, cultural venues, traditional "shopping arcades" and recreational areas.</p>
       <p>The city proper is administratively known as "The Municipality of Bucharest" (<i>Municipiul Bucure&#x219;ti</i>), and has the same administrative level as that of a national <!--del_lnk--> county, being further subdivided into six <!--del_lnk--> sectors.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>The name of <i>Bucure&#x15F;ti</i> has an uncertain origin: tradition connects the <!--del_lnk--> founding of Bucharest with the name of <i><!--del_lnk--> Bucur</i> who was either a prince, an outlaw, a fisherman, a <!--del_lnk--> shepherd, or a hunter, according to different legends. In <!--del_lnk--> Romanian the word stem <i>bucur</i> means 'joy', ("beautiful") and it is believed to be of <!--del_lnk--> Dacian origin.</p>
       <p>There are other etymologies given by early scholars, including the one of an Ottoman traveler, <!--del_lnk--> Evliya &Ccedil;elebi, who said that Bucharest was named after a certain "Abu-Kari&#x15F;", from the tribe of "Bani-Kurei&#x15F;". In 1781, Franz Sulzer claimed that it was related to <i>bucurie</i> (joy), <i>bucuros</i> (joyful) or <i>a se bucura</i> (to become joyful), while an early 19th century book published in Vienna assumed its name has been derived from "Bukovie", a beech forest.</p>
       <p>The official city name in full is "The Municipal Area of Bucharest" (<!--del_lnk--> Romanian: <span lang="ro" xml:lang="ro"><i>Municipiul Bucure&#x219;ti</i></span>).</p>
       <p>A native or resident of Bucharest is called a "Bucharester" (<!--del_lnk--> Romanian: <span lang="ro" xml:lang="ro"><i>bucure&#x219;tean</i></span>).</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>Bucharest's history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in the <!--del_lnk--> Antiquity until its consolidation as the national Capital of Romania late in the 19th century.</p>

       <p>First mentioned as the "<!--del_lnk--> Citadel of Bucure&#x219;ti" in 1459, it became the residence of the famous <!--del_lnk--> Wallachian <!--del_lnk--> prince <!--del_lnk--> Vlad III the Impaler.</p>
       <p>The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators to run the town from the 18th century. A revolt led by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 ended the rule of the Constantinople-Greeks in Bucharest.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Old Princely Court (<i>Curtea Veche</i>) was erected by <!--del_lnk--> Mircea Ciobanul, and under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come it competed with <!--del_lnk--> T&acirc;rgovi&#x219;te on the status of Capital city after an increase in the importance of southern <!--del_lnk--> Muntenia brought about by the demands of the <!--del_lnk--> suzerain power - the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.</p>
       <p>Bucharest became finally the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Constantin Br&acirc;ncoveanu).</p>
       <p>Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by <i><!--del_lnk--> Caragea's plague</i> in 1813&ndash;1814, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Russian_Empire.htm" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a> (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under <!--del_lnk--> Russian administration between 1828 and the <a href="../../wp/c/Crimean_War.htm" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a>, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred <!--del_lnk--> 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later on an <!--del_lnk--> Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). Additionally, on 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city.</p>
       <p>In 1862, after <!--del_lnk--> Wallachia and <!--del_lnk--> Moldavia were united to form the <!--del_lnk--> Principality of Romania, Bucharest became the new nation's capital city. In 1881, it became the political centre of the newly-proclaimed <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Romania under King <!--del_lnk--> Carol I. During the second half of the 19th century the city's population increased dramatically, and a new period of urban development began. During this period, <!--del_lnk--> gas lighting, <!--del_lnk--> horse-drawn trams and limited <!--del_lnk--> electrification were introduced. The D&acirc;mbovi&#x163;a river was also massively channelled in 1883, thus putting a stop to previously endemic floods. The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of "Little Paris" (<i>Micul Paris</i>) of the east, with <!--del_lnk--> Calea Victoriei as its <!--del_lnk--> Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es.</p>
       <p>Between 6 December 1916 and November 1918, the city was occupied by <!--del_lnk--> German forces as a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Bucharest, with the official capital temporarily removed to <!--del_lnk--> Ia&#x219;i in the Moldova county. After World War I, Bucharest became the capital of <!--del_lnk--> Greater Romania. In the interwar years continued its urban development, with the city gaining an average of 30,000 new residents each year. Also, some of the city's main landmarks were built in this period, including <!--del_lnk--> Arcul de Triumf and <!--del_lnk--> Palatul Telefoanelor. However, the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Depression.htm" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> took its toll on Bucharest's citizens, culminating in the <!--del_lnk--> Grivi&#x163;a Strike of 1933.</p>
       <p>In January 1941, the city was the scene of the <!--del_lnk--> Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom. As capital of an <!--del_lnk--> Axis country and a major transit point for Axis troops en route to the <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Front_%2528World_War_II%2529.htm" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Eastern Front</a>, Bucharest suffered heavy damage during World War II due to <!--del_lnk--> Allied bombings. On 23 August 1944 it was the site of <!--del_lnk--> the royal coup which brought Romania into the <!--del_lnk--> Allied camp, suffering a short period of nazi <a href="../../wp/l/Luftwaffe.htm" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> bombings as well as a failed attempt by German troops to regain the city by force.</p>
       <p>After the establishment of <!--del_lnk--> communism in Romania, the city continued growing. New districts were constructed, most of them dominated by <!--del_lnk--> tower blocks. During <!--del_lnk--> Nicolae Ceau&#x219;escu's leadership (1965&ndash;1989), much of the historic part of the city was demolished and replaced by "<!--del_lnk--> Socialist realism" style development: (1)the <!--del_lnk--> Centrul Civic (the Civic Centre); (2)the <!--del_lnk--> Palace of the Parliament, where an entire historic quarter was razed to make way for Ceau&#x219;escu's megalomaniac plans. On 4 March 1977, an <!--del_lnk--> earthquake centered in Vrancea, about 135&nbsp;km (83.89&nbsp;mi) away, claimed 1,500 lives and caused further damage to the historic centre.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Revolution of 1989 began with massive anti-Ceau&#x219;escu protests in <!--del_lnk--> Timi&#x219;oara in December 1989 and continued in Bucharest, leading to the overthrow of the <!--del_lnk--> Communist regime. Dissatisfied with the post-revolutionary leadership of the <!--del_lnk--> National Salvation Front, some student leagues and opposition groups organized large-scale protests in 1990 (the "<!--del_lnk--> Golaniad"), which were violently repressed by the miners of <!--del_lnk--> Valea Jiului called in by the authorities (the "<!--del_lnk--> Mineriad"). Several other "Mineriads" followed, which finally caused political changes.</p>
       <p>After 2000 the city was continuously modernized and is still undergoing urban renewals. Residential and commercial developments are underway, particularly in the northern districts, and Bucharest's old historic centre is being restored nowadays.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Bucharest is situated on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> D&acirc;mbovi&#x21B;a River, which flows into the <!--del_lnk--> Arge&#x219; River, a tributary of the <a href="../../wp/d/Danube.htm" title="Danube">Danube</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Several lakes&nbsp;&ndash; the most important of which are Lake Her&#x103;str&#x103;u, Lake Floreasca, Lake Tei, and Lake Colentina&nbsp;&ndash; stretch across the northern parts of the city, along the <!--del_lnk--> Colentina River, a tributary of the D&acirc;mbovi&#x21B;a. In addition, in the centre of the capital there is a small artificial lake&nbsp;&ndash; Lake Ci&#x219;migiu&nbsp;&ndash; surrounded by the <!--del_lnk--> Ci&#x219;migiu Gardens. The <!--del_lnk--> Ci&#x219;migiu Gardens have a rich history, being frequented by poets and writers. Opened in 1847 and based on the plans of German architect Carl F.W. Meyer, the gardens are the main recreational facility in the city centre.</p>
       <p>Besides Ci&#x219;migiu, Bucharest contains other parks and gardens, including the <!--del_lnk--> Her&#x103;str&#x103;u Park and the <!--del_lnk--> Botanical Garden. The park is located in the northern part of the city, around Lake Her&#x103;str&#x103;u, and includes also the site of the <!--del_lnk--> Village Museum. The Botanical Garden is the largest of its kind in Romania and contains over 10,000 species of plants (many of them exotic) and used to be once the pleasure park of the royal family.</p>
       <p>Bucharest is situated in the south eastern corner of the <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Plain, in an area once covered by the <!--del_lnk--> Vl&#x103;siei forest, which, after it was cleared, gave way for a fertile flatland. As with many cities, Bucharest is traditionally considered to be built upon seven hills, similar to the seven hills of Rome. Bucharest's seven hills are: <!--del_lnk--> Mihai Vod&#x103;, <!--del_lnk--> Dealul Mitropoliei, Radu Vod&#x103;, <!--del_lnk--> Cotroceni, <!--del_lnk--> Spirei, <!--del_lnk--> V&#x103;c&#x103;re&#x219;ti and Sf. Gheorghe Nou.</p>
       <p>The city has an area of 226 square kilometres (87&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). The altitude varies from 55.8 metres (183.1&nbsp;ft) at the D&acirc;mbovi&#x21B;a bridge in <!--del_lnk--> C&#x103;&#x21B;elu, south-eastern Bucharest and 91.5&nbsp;m (300.2&nbsp;ft) at the <!--del_lnk--> Militari church. The city has an approximately round shape, with the centre situated in the cross-way of the main north-south/east-west axes at <!--del_lnk--> University Square. The milestone for Romania's <!--del_lnk--> Kilometre Zero is placed just south of University Square in front of the New St. George Church (Sf&acirc;ntul Gheorghe Nou) at St. George Square (Pia&#x163;a Sf&acirc;ntul Gheorghe). Bucharest's radius, from University Square to the city limits in all directions, varies from about 10 to 12&nbsp;km (6.25&ndash;7.5&nbsp;mi).</p>
       <p>Until recently, the regions surrounding Bucharest were largely rural, but after 1989, suburbs started to be built around Bucharest, in the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Ilfov county. Further urban consolidation is expected to take place in the late 2010s, when the "Bucharest Metropolitan Area" plan will become operational, incorporating additional communes and cities from the <!--del_lnk--> Ilfov and other neighbouring counties.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
       <p>Bucharest has a transitional climate, with both <!--del_lnk--> continental and <!--del_lnk--> subtropical influences (<!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;ppen climate classification <i>Cfa/Dfa/Cfb/Dfb</i>). Due to its position on the <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Plain, the city's winters can get windy, even though some of the winds are mitigated due to urbanisation. Winter temperatures often dip below <span style="white-space:nowrap;">0 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(32&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, sometimes even to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;20 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(&minus;4&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>. In summer, the average temperature is <span style="white-space:nowrap;">23 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(73&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> (the average for July and August) Temperatures frequently reach <span style="white-space:nowrap;">35 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(95&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">40 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(104&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> in mid-summer in the city centre. Although average <!--del_lnk--> precipitation and <!--del_lnk--> humidity during summer are low, there are occasional heavy storms. During spring and autumn, daytime temperatures vary between <span style="white-space:nowrap;">17 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(63&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">22 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(72&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, and precipitation during this time tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Bucharest has a unique status in Romanian administration, since it is the only municipal area that is not part of a <!--del_lnk--> county. Its population, however, is larger than that of any other Romanian county, hence the power of the Bucharest General Municipality (<i>Prim&#x103;ria General&#x103;</i>), which is the capital's local government body, is the same as, if not greater than, that of any Romanian national county council.</p>
       <p>The city government is headed by a <!--del_lnk--> General Mayor (Primar General), as of 2008 <!--del_lnk--> Sorin Oprescu. Decisions are approved and discussed by the capital's <!--del_lnk--> General Council (Consiliu General) made up of 55 elected councilors. Furthermore, the city is divided into six administrative <!--del_lnk--> sectors (sectoare), each of which has their own 27-seat sectoral council, town hall and mayor. The powers of the local government over a certain area are therefore shared both by the Bucharest Municipality and the local sectoral councils with little or no overlapping of authority. The general rule is that the main Capital Municipality is responsible for citywide utilities such as the water and sewage system, the overall transport system and the main boulevards, while sectoral town halls manage the contact between individuals and the local government, secondary streets and parks maintenance, schools administration and cleaning services.</p>
       <p>The six sectors are numbered from one to six and are disposed radially so that each one has under its administration a certain area of the city centre. They are numbered clockwise and are further divided into sectoral quarters (<i>cartiere</i>) which are not part of the official administrative division:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 1</b> (population 227,717): <!--del_lnk--> Doroban&#x21B;i, <!--del_lnk--> B&#x103;neasa, <!--del_lnk--> Avia&#x21B;iei, <!--del_lnk--> Pipera, Aviatorilor, Prim&#x103;verii, Roman&#x103;, Victoriei, <!--del_lnk--> Her&#x103;str&#x103;u Park, <!--del_lnk--> Bucure&#x219;tii Noi, D&#x103;m&#x103;roaia, Str&#x1CE;ule&#x219;ti, <!--del_lnk--> Grivi&#x21B;a, 1 Mai, <!--del_lnk--> B&#x103;neasa Forest, Pajura, Domenii</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 2</b> (population 357,338): <!--del_lnk--> Pantelimon, <!--del_lnk--> Colentina, <!--del_lnk--> Iancului, <!--del_lnk--> Tei, <!--del_lnk--> Floreasca, <!--del_lnk--> Mo&#x15F;ilor, <!--del_lnk--> Obor, Vatra Luminoas&#x103;, Fundeni, <!--del_lnk--> Plumbuita, &#x218;tefan cel Mare, Baicului</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 3</b> (population 399,231): <!--del_lnk--> Vitan, <!--del_lnk--> Dude&#x219;ti, <!--del_lnk--> Titan, <!--del_lnk--> Centrul Civic, <!--del_lnk--> Dristor, <!--del_lnk--> Lipscani, Muncii, Unirii</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 4</b> (population 300,331): <!--del_lnk--> Berceni, <!--del_lnk--> Olteni&#x21B;ei, <!--del_lnk--> Giurgiului, <!--del_lnk--> Progresul, <!--del_lnk--> V&#x103;c&#x103;re&#x219;ti, Timpuri Noi, Tineretului</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 5</b> (population 288,690): <!--del_lnk--> Rahova, <!--del_lnk--> Ferentari, <!--del_lnk--> Giurgiului, <!--del_lnk--> Cotroceni, 13 Septembrie, Dealul Spirii</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 6</b> (population 371,060): <!--del_lnk--> Giule&#x219;ti, <!--del_lnk--> Cr&acirc;nga&#x219;i, <!--del_lnk--> Drumul Taberei, <!--del_lnk--> Militari, Groz&#x1CE;ve&#x219;ti (also known as Regie), <!--del_lnk--> Ghencea</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Like all other local councils in Romania, the Bucharest sectoral councils, the capital's <!--del_lnk--> General Council and the mayors are elected every four years by the population. Additionally, Bucharest has a <!--del_lnk--> prefect, who is appointed by Romania's national government. The prefect is not allowed to be a member of a political party and his role is to represent the national government at the municipal level. The prefect is acting as a liaison official facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programs at local level. The prefect of Bucharest (as of 2012) is Georgeta Gavril&#x103;.</p>
       <p>The Municipality of Bucharest, along with the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Ilfov County and several other neighbouring counties are part of the <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest development region project, which is equivalent to <!--del_lnk--> NUTS-II regions in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> and is used both by the Union and the Romanian Government for statistical analysis and regional development planning. The Bucharest development region is not, however, an administrative entity yet.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Bucharest's judicial system is similar to that of the Romanian counties. Each of the six sectors has its own local first instance court (<i>judec&#x103;torie</i>), while appeals from these courts' verdicts, and more serious cases, are directed to the Bucharest Tribunal, the city's municipal court. The Bucharest Court of Appeal judges appeals against decisions taken by tribunals in Bucharest and in five surrounding counties (Teleorman, Ialomi&#x163;a, Giurgiu, C&#x103;l&#x103;ra&#x15F;i and Ilfov). Bucharest is also home to Romania's supreme court, the <!--del_lnk--> High Court of Cassation and Justice, as well as to the <!--del_lnk--> Constitutional Court of Romania.</p>
       <p>Bucharest has a municipal police force, the Bucharest Police (<i>Poli&#x21B;ia Bucure&#x219;ti</i>), which is responsible for policing of crime within the whole city, and operates a number of divisions. The Bucharest Police are headquartered on &#x15E;tefan cel Mare Blvd. in the city centre, and at precincts throughout the city. From 2004 onwards, each Sector City Hall also has under its administration a Community Police force (<i><!--del_lnk--> Poli&#x21B;ia Comunitar&#x103;</i>), dealing with local community issues. Bucharest also houses the General Inspectorates of the <!--del_lnk--> Gendarmerie and the <!--del_lnk--> National Police.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Crime">Crime</span></h3>
       <p>Bucharest's crime rate is rather low in comparison to other European capital cities, with the number of total offenses declining by 51% between 2000 and 2004. The violent crime rate in Bucharest remains very low, with 11 murders and 983 other violent offenses taking place in 2007. Although in the 2000s, there were a number of police crackdowns on <!--del_lnk--> organized crime gangs, such as the C&#x103;m&#x103;taru clan, organized crime generally has little impact on public life. Petty crime, however, is more common, particularly in the form of <!--del_lnk--> pickpocketing, which occurs mainly on the city's public transport network. <!--del_lnk--> Confidence tricks were common in the 1990s, especially in regards to tourists, but the frequency of these incidents has since declined. Levels of crime are higher in the southern districts of the city, particularly in <!--del_lnk--> Ferentari, a socially-disadvantaged area.</p>
       <p>Although the presence of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Street_children.htm" title="Street children">street children</a> was a problem in Bucharest in the 1990s, their numbers have declined in recent years, now lying at or below the average of major European capital cities. A documentary called <!--del_lnk--> Children Underground depicted the life of Romanian street kids in 2001. There are still an estimated 1,000 street children in the city, some of whom engage in petty crime and begging.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Quality_of_life">Quality of life</span></h2>
       <p>As stated by the <!--del_lnk--> Mercer international surveys for quality of life in cities around the world, Bucharest occupied the 94th place in 2001 and slipped lower, to the 108th place in 2009 and the 107th place in 2010. Compared to it, Vienna occupied No.&nbsp;1 worldwide in 2011 and 2009. Budapest ranked 73rd (2010) and Sofia 114th (2010). Mercer Human Resource Consulting issues yearly a global ranking of the world's most livable cities based on 39 key quality-of-life issues. Among them: political stability, currency-exchange regulations, political and media censorship, school quality, housing, the environment, public safety. Mercer collects data worldwide, in 215 cities. The difficult situation of the quality of life in Bucharest is confirmed also by a vast urbanism study, done by the <!--del_lnk--> Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism.</p>

       <p>As per preliminary data from <!--del_lnk--> 2011 census, 1,677,985 inhabitants live within the city limits, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census.</p>
       <p>The city's population, according to the 2002 census, was 1,926,334 inhabitants, or 8.9% of the total population of Romania. A significant number of people commute to the city every day, mostly from the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Ilfov county, however official statistics regarding their numbers do not exist.</p>
       <p>Bucharest's population experienced two phases of rapid growth, the first beginning in the late 19th century when the city was consolidated as the national capital and lasting until the Second World War, and the second during the Ceau&#x15F;escu years (1965&ndash;1989), when a massive urbanization campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas to the capital. At this time, due to Ceau&#x15F;escu's decision to ban abortion and contraception, <!--del_lnk--> natural increase was also significant.</p>
       <p>Approximately 96.6% of the population of Bucharest are <!--del_lnk--> Romanians. Other significant ethnic groups are <a href="../../wp/r/Romani_people.htm" title="Romani people">Roma Gypsies</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Hungarians, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/Jews.htm" title="Jewish people">Jews</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Turks, <!--del_lnk--> Chinese and <!--del_lnk--> Germans. A relatively small number of Bucharesters are of <!--del_lnk--> Greek, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North American">North American</a>, <!--del_lnk--> French, <!--del_lnk--> Armenian, <!--del_lnk--> Lippovan and <!--del_lnk--> Italian descent. One of the predominantly Greek neighborhoods was <!--del_lnk--> Vitan &ndash; where a Jewish population also lived; the latter was more present in <!--del_lnk--> V&#x103;c&#x103;re&#x219;ti and areas around <!--del_lnk--> Unirii Square.</p>
       <p>In terms of religious affiliation, 96.1% of the population are <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Orthodox, 1.2% are <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic, 0.5% are <!--del_lnk--> Muslim and 0.4% are <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Greek Catholic. Despite this, only 18% of the population, of any religion, attend a place of worship once a week or more. The life expectancy of residents of Bucharest in 2003&ndash;2005 was 74.14 years, around 2 years higher than the Romanian average. Female life expectancy was 77.41 years, in comparison to 70.57 years for males.</p>

       <p>Bucharest is the centre of the <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romanian</a> economy and industry, accounting for around 22.7% (2010) of the country's <a href="../../wp/g/Gross_domestic_product.htm" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a> and about one-quarter of its industrial production, while being inhabited by 9% of the country's population. Almost one third of national taxes are paid by Bucharest's citizens and companies. In 2009, at purchasing power parity, Bucharest had a per-capita GDP of &euro;26,100, or 111% that of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> average and more than twice the <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romanian</a> average. After relative stagnation in the 1990s, the city's strong economic growth has revitalized infrastructure and led to the development of shopping malls, residential estates and high-rise office buildings. In September 2005, Bucharest had an unemployment rate of 2.6%, significantly lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.7%.</p>

       <p>Bucharest's economy is centred on industry and <!--del_lnk--> services, with services particularly growing in importance in the last ten years. The headquarters of 186,000 firms, including nearly all large Romanian companies are located in Bucharest. An important source of growth since 2000 has been the city's rapidly expanding property and construction sector. Bucharest is also Romania's largest centre for information technology and communications and is home to several software companies operating offshore delivery centres. Romania's largest stock exchange, the <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest Stock Exchange, which was merged in December 2005 with the Bucharest-based electronic stock exchange <!--del_lnk--> Rasdaq, plays a major role in the city's economy.</p>
       <p>There are international supermarket chains such as <!--del_lnk--> Carrefour, <!--del_lnk--> Cora and <!--del_lnk--> METRO operating in Bucharest. The city is undergoing a retail boom, with supermarkets and hypermarkets opened every year (see <!--del_lnk--> supermarkets in Romania). Malls and large shopping centres have been built since the late 1990s, such as <!--del_lnk--> AFI Palace Cotroceni, <!--del_lnk--> Sun Plaza, <!--del_lnk--> B&#x103;neasa Shopping City, <!--del_lnk--> Plaza Romania, <!--del_lnk--> Unirea Shopping Center and Liberty Centre.

       <p>Bucharest has two <!--del_lnk--> international airports:</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Henri Coand&#x103; International Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: OTP, <!--del_lnk--> ICAO: LROP), located 16.5&nbsp;km (10.3&nbsp;mi) north of the Bucharest city centre, in the town of Otopeni, Ilfov. The airport has one terminal divided into two inter-connected buildings (Departures Hall and Arrivals Hall). The International Departures Hall consists of 36 check-in desks, one finger with 24 gates (14 equipped with jetways), while the Domestic Hall has an extra four gates. Today's Arrivals Hall is the old Otopeni terminal, while the new Departures Hall, including the finger and the airbridges, was built and inaugurated in 1997. An expansion of the finger was opened in March 2011, other expansions of Departure Hall and Arrivals Hall are underway and a new terminal on the east side is in project phase. The airport received 5,069,003 passengers in the first 8 months of 2012.</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Aurel Vlaicu International Airport (IATA: BBU, ICAO: LRBS) is Bucharest's business and VIP airport. It is situated only 8&nbsp;km (5.0&nbsp;mi) north of the Bucharest city centre and is accessible by RATB buses 131, 335, 301, tramway 5 and Airport Express 783 and taxi. An extension of Line M2 of the Bucharest Metro to Aurel Vlaicu International, which will link it to the Main Train Station and the larger Henri Coand&#x103; International Airport, was approved in June 2006 and is in the planning stage. It was Bucharest's only airport until 1965, when the Otopeni Airport (today Henri Coand&#x103; International Airport) was converted to civilian use. Until March 2012 (when it was converted into a business airport), it was the second airport in Romania in terms of air traffic and Bucharest's low-cost hub. It was named after <!--del_lnk--> Aurel Vlaicu, a Romanian engineer, inventor, airplane constructor and early pilot. In 2012 this airport was closed due to the lobby made by non-low-cost companies (because Aurel Vlaicu, where low cost companies operated is closer to the ceter than Henri Coanda) and all the commercial activity was moved to Henri Coanda. Now it is used only for small private flights.</li>

       <p>Bucharest is a major intersection of <!--del_lnk--> Romania's national road network. A few of the busiest national roads and motorways, link the city to all of Romania's major cities as well as to neighbouring countries such as <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bulgaria.htm" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> A1 to Pite&#x15F;ti, the <!--del_lnk--> A2 Sun Motorway to the Dobrogea region and Constanta and the <!--del_lnk--> A3 to Ploiesti all start from Bucharest. The future <!--del_lnk--> A5 motorways will radiate from <!--del_lnk--> Voluntari, a town in the city's northern outskirts.</p>
       <p>The city's municipal road network is centred around a series of high-capacity boulevards, which generally radiate out from the city centre to the outskirts. The main axes, which run north-south, east-west and northwest-southeast, as well as one internal and one external ring road, support the bulk of the traffic. The city's roads are usually very crowded during rush hours, due to an increase in car ownership in recent years. Every day, there are more than one million vehicles travelling within the city. This results in wear and <!--del_lnk--> potholes appearing on busy roads, particularly secondary roads, this being identified as one of Bucharest's main infrastructural problems. There has been a comprehensive effort on behalf of the City Hall to boost road infrastructure and according to the general development plan, 2,000 roads have been repaired by 2008. On 17 June 2011, the <!--del_lnk--> Basarab Overpass was inaugurated and opened to traffic, thus completing the inner city traffic ring. The overpass took 5 years to build and is the longest <!--del_lnk--> cable-stayed bridge in Romania and the widest such bridge in Europe; upon completion, traffic on the <!--del_lnk--> Grant Bridge and in the <!--del_lnk--> Gara de Nord area became noticeably more fluid.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Water">Water</span></h3>
       <p>Although it is situated on the banks of a river, Bucharest has never functioned as a port city, with other Romanian cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Constan&#x21B;a and <!--del_lnk--> Gala&#x21B;i acting as the country's main ports. The unfinished <!--del_lnk--> Danube-Bucharest Canal, which is 73&nbsp;km (45&nbsp;mi) long and approximately 70% completed, could link Bucharest to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Danube.htm" title="Danube River">Danube River</a> and, via the <!--del_lnk--> Danube-Black Sea Canal, to the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>.

       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Landmarks">Landmarks</span></h3>
       <p>Bucharest has landmark buildings and monuments. Perhaps the most prominent of these is the <!--del_lnk--> Palace of the Parliament, built in the 1980s during the reign of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceau&#x219;escu.

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Athenaeum building is considered to be a symbol of Romanian culture and since 2007 is on the list of the Label of European Heritage sights.</p>

       <p>Of the city's <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">medieval</a> architecture, most of what survived into modern times was destroyed by Communist <!--del_lnk--> systematization, fire and military incursions. Some medieval and renaissance edifices remain, the most notable are in the <!--del_lnk--> Lipscani area. This precinct contains notable buildings such as <!--del_lnk--> Manuc's Inn (<i>Hanul lui Manuc</i>) and the ruins of the <!--del_lnk--> Old Court (<i>Curtea Veche</i>), during the late <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> this area was the heart of commerce in Bucharest. From the 1970s onwards, the area went through urban decline, and many historical buildings fell into disrepair. In 2005, the Lipscani area was pedestrianised and is undergoing restoration.</p>
       <p>The city centre has retained architecture from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly the <!--del_lnk--> interwar period, which is often seen as the "golden age" of Bucharest architecture. During this time, the city grew in size and wealth therefore seeking to emulate other large European capitals such as <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Much of the architecture of the time belongs to a Modern (rationalist) Architecture current, led by Horia Creang&#x103; and <!--del_lnk--> Marcel Iancu.</p>
       <p>Two notable buildings from this time are the <!--del_lnk--> Cre&#x21B;ulescu Palace, housing cultural institutions including <a href="../../wp/u/UNESCO.htm" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>'s European Centre for Higher Education, and the <!--del_lnk--> Cotroceni Palace, the residence of the <!--del_lnk--> Romanian President. Many large-scale constructions such as <!--del_lnk--> Gara de Nord, the busiest railway station in the city, <!--del_lnk--> National Bank of Romania's headquarters and the <!--del_lnk--> Telephone Palace date from these times. In the 2000s, historic buildings in the city centre underwent restoration. In some residential areas of the city, particularly in high-income central and northern districts, there are <!--del_lnk--> turn of the 19th to 20th century villas, most of which were restored beginning in the late 1990s.</p>

       </div>
       <p>A major part of Bucharest's architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the <!--del_lnk--> Communist era replacing the historical architecture with high density apartment blocks &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> significant portions of the historic centre of Bucharest were demolished in order to construct one of the largest buildings in the world, the <!--del_lnk--> Palace of the Parliament (then officially called the House of the Republic). In Nicolae Ceau&#x219;escu's project of <!--del_lnk--> systematization new buildings were built in previously-historical areas, which were razed and then built upon.</p>
       <p>One of the best examples of this type of architecture is <!--del_lnk--> Centrul Civic, a development that replaced a major part of Bucharest's historic city centre with giant utilitarian buildings, mainly with <!--del_lnk--> marble or <!--del_lnk--> travertine fa&ccedil;ades, inspired by <a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korean</a> architecture. Communist-era architecture can also be found in Bucharest's residential districts, mainly in <i>blocuri</i>, which are high-density apartment blocks that house the majority of the city's population.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Since <!--del_lnk--> the fall of Communism in 1989, several Communist-era buildings have been refurbished, modernised and used for other purposes. Perhaps the best example of this is the conversion of obsolete retail complexes into shopping malls and commercial centres. These giant circular halls, which were unofficially called <!--del_lnk--> hunger circuses due to the food shortages experienced in the 1980s, were constructed during the Ceau&#x219;escu era to act as produce markets and <!--del_lnk--> refectories, although most were left unfinished at the time of the Revolution.</p>
       <p>Modern shopping malls like <!--del_lnk--> Unirea Shopping Centre, <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest Mall, <!--del_lnk--> Plaza Romania and <!--del_lnk--> City Mall emerged on pre-existent structures of former hunger circuses. Another example is the conversion of a large utilitarian construction in <!--del_lnk--> Centrul Civic into a <!--del_lnk--> Marriott Hotel. This process was accelerated after 2000, when the city underwent a property boom, and many Communist-era buildings in the city centre became prime real estate due to their location. Many Communist-era apartment blocks have also been refurbished to improve urban appearance.</p>

       <p>The newest contribution to Bucharest's architecture took place after the fall of Communism, particularly after 2000, when the city went through a period of urban renewal&nbsp;&ndash; and architectural revitalization&nbsp;&ndash; on the back of Romania's economic growth. Buildings from this time are mostly made of glass and steel, and often have more than ten storeys. Examples include shopping malls (particularly the <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest Mall, a conversion and extension of an abandoned building), office buildings, bank headquarters, etc.</p>
       <p>As of 2005, there are office buildings under construction, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the city. Additionally, there has been a trend to add modern wings and fa&ccedil;ades to historic buildings, the most prominent example of which is the Bucharest Architects' Association Building, which is a modern glass-and-steel construction built inside a historic stone fa&ccedil;ade.</p>
       <p>Aside from buildings used for business and institutions, residential developments are underway, many of which consist of high-rise office buildings and suburban residential communities. These developments are increasingly prominent in northern Bucharest, which is less densely-populated and is home to middle- and upper-class Bucharesters due to the process of <!--del_lnk--> gentrification.</p>
