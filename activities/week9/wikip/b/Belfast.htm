       <p><b>Belfast</b> (from <!--del_lnk--> Irish: <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga"><i>B&eacute;al Feirste</i></span>, meaning "<!--del_lnk--> mouth of the <!--del_lnk--> sandbanks") is the capital of, and largest city in, <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Most of Belfast is in <!--del_lnk--> County Antrim, but parts of East and South Belfast are in <!--del_lnk--> County Down. It is on the flood plain of the <!--del_lnk--> River Lagan.</p>
       <p>By population, it is the fourteenth largest city in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and second largest on the <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">island of Ireland</a>. It is the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> devolved <!--del_lnk--> government and legislative <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Assembly. The city of Belfast has a population of 281,000 and lies at the heart of the <!--del_lnk--> Belfast urban area, which has a population of 579,276. The <!--del_lnk--> Larger Urban Zone, as defined by the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, has a total population 641,638. Belfast was granted <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm#Northern_Ireland" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city status</a> in 1888.</p>
       <p>Historically, Belfast has been a centre for the Irish <!--del_lnk--> linen industry (earning the nickname "<!--del_lnk--> Linenopolis"), tobacco production, rope-making and shipbuilding: the city's main shipbuilders, <!--del_lnk--> Harland and Wolff, which built the well-known <i><a href="../../wp/r/RMS_Titanic.htm" title="RMS Titanic">RMS Titanic</a></i>, propelled Belfast on to the global stage in the early 20th century as the biggest and most productive shipyard in the world. Belfast played a key role in the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, establishing its place as a global industrial centre until the latter half of the 20th century. Industrialisation and the inward migration it brought made Belfast, if briefly, the biggest city in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century and the city's industrial and economic success was cited by <!--del_lnk--> Ulster unionist opponents of <!--del_lnk--> Home Rule as a reason why Ireland should shun devolution and later why <!--del_lnk--> Ulster in particular would fight to resist it.</p>
       <p>Today, Belfast remains a centre for industry, as well as the arts, higher education and business, a legal centre, and is the economic engine of Northern Ireland. The city suffered greatly during the period of conflict called <!--del_lnk--> the Troubles, but latterly has undergone a sustained period of calm, free from the intense political violence of former years, and substantial economic and commercial growth. <!--del_lnk--> Belfast city centre has undergone considerable expansion and regeneration in recent years, notably around <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Square. Belfast is served by two airports: <!--del_lnk--> George Best Belfast City Airport in the city, and <!--del_lnk--> Belfast International Airport 15 miles (24&nbsp;km) west of the city. Belfast is also a major <!--del_lnk--> port, with commercial and industrial docks dominating the <!--del_lnk--> Belfast Lough shoreline, including the famous Harland and Wolff shipyard. Belfast is a constituent city of the <!--del_lnk--> Dublin-Belfast corridor, which has a population of three million, or half the total population of the island of Ireland.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Name">Name</span></h2>
       <p>The name <i>Belfast</i> is derived from the Irish <i>B&eacute;al Feirsde</i>, which was later spelled <i>B&eacute;al Feirste</i>. The word <i>b&eacute;al</i> means "mouth" or "rivermouth" while <i>feirsde/feirste</i> is the genitive singular of <i>fearsaid</i> and refers to a <!--del_lnk--> sandbar or tidal <!--del_lnk--> ford across a river's mouth. The name would thus translate literally as "(river) mouth of the sandbar" or "(river) mouth of the ford". This sandbar was formed at the confluence of two rivers at what is now Donegall Quay: the <!--del_lnk--> Lagan, which flows into Belfast Lough, and its tributary the <!--del_lnk--> Farset. This area was the hub around which the original settlement developed. The Irish name <i>B&eacute;al Feirste</i> is shared by a <!--del_lnk--> townland in <!--del_lnk--> County Mayo, whose name has been anglicised as <i>Belfarsad</i>.</p>
       <p>An alternative interpretation of the name is "mouth of [the river] of the sandbar", an allusion to the River Farset, which flows into the Lagan where the sandbar was located. This interpretation was favoured by <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Hogan and <!--del_lnk--> John O'Donovan. It seems clear, however, that the river itself was also named after the tidal crossing.</p>
       <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Ulster Scots the name of the city is <i>Bilfawst</i> or <i>Bilfaust</i>, although "Belfast" is also used.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>Although the <!--del_lnk--> county borough of Belfast was created when it was granted city status by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Queen_Victoria.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> in 1888, the city continues to be viewed as straddling <!--del_lnk--> County Antrim and <!--del_lnk--> County Down.</p>

The <!--del_lnk--> Giant's Ring, a 5,000-year-old <!--del_lnk--> henge, is located near the city, and the remains of <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> <!--del_lnk--> hill forts can still be seen in the surrounding hills. Belfast remained a small settlement of little importance during the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Ages. <!--del_lnk--> John de Courcy built a castle on what is now Castle Street in the city centre in the 12th century, but this was on a lesser scale and not as strategically important as <!--del_lnk--> Carrickfergus Castle to the north, which was built by de Courcy in 1177. The <!--del_lnk--> O'Neill clan had a presence in the area. In the 14th century, Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, descendants of Aodh Buidhe O'Neill built Grey Castle at Castlereagh, now in the east of the city. Conn O'Neill of the Clannaboy O'Neills owned vast lands in the area and was the last inhabitant of Grey Castle, one remaining link being the Conn's Water river flowing through east Belfast.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Belfast became a substantial settlement in the 17th century after being established as a town by <!--del_lnk--> Sir Arthur Chichester, which was initially settled by Protestant English and Scottish migrants at the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Plantation of Ulster. (Belfast and County Antrim, however, did not form part of this particular Plantation scheme as they were privately colonised.) In 1791, the <!--del_lnk--> Society of United Irishmen was founded in Belfast, after <!--del_lnk--> Henry Joy McCracken and other prominent Presbyterians from the city invited <!--del_lnk--> Theobald Wolfe Tone and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Russell to a meeting, after having read Tone's "Argument on Behalf of the Catholics of Ireland". Evidence of this period of Belfast's growth can still be seen in the oldest areas of the city, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Entries.</p>
       <p>Belfast blossomed as a commercial and industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries and became Ireland's pre-eminent industrial city. Industries thrived, including linen, rope-making, tobacco, heavy engineering and shipbuilding, and at the end of the 19th century, Belfast briefly overtook Dublin as the largest city in Ireland. The Harland and Wolff shipyards became one of the largest shipbuilders in the world, employing up to 35,000 workers. In 1886 the city suffered intense <!--del_lnk--> riots over the issue of home rule, which had divided the city.</p>
       <p>In 1920&ndash;22, Belfast became the capital of the new entity of Northern Ireland as the island of Ireland was partitioned. The accompanying conflict (the <!--del_lnk--> Irish War of Independence) cost up to 500 lives in Belfast, the bloodiest sectarian strife in the city until the Troubles of the late 1960s onwards.</p>
       <p>Belfast was <!--del_lnk--> heavily bombed during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. In one raid, in 1941, German bombers killed around one thousand people and left tens of thousands homeless. Apart from London, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Blitz.htm" title="The Blitz">Blitz</a>.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Belfast has been the capital of Northern Ireland since its establishment in 1921 following the <!--del_lnk--> Government of Ireland Act 1920. It had been the scene of various episodes of sectarian conflict between its Catholic and Protestant populations. These opposing groups in this conflict are now often termed <!--del_lnk--> republican and <!--del_lnk--> loyalist respectively, although they are also referred to as '<!--del_lnk--> nationalist' and '<!--del_lnk--> unionist'. The most recent example of this conflict was known as the Troubles &ndash; a civil conflict that raged from around 1969 to 1998. Belfast saw some of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s, with rival paramilitary groups formed on both sides. Bombing, assassination and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the Troubles. The <!--del_lnk--> Provisional IRA detonated 22 bombs within the confines of Belfast city centre in 1972, on what is known as "<!--del_lnk--> Bloody Friday", killing nine people. Loyalist paramilitaries including the <!--del_lnk--> Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the <!--del_lnk--> Ulster Defence Association (UDA) claimed that the killings they carried out were in retaliation for the <!--del_lnk--> IRA campaign. Most of their victims were Catholics with no links to the Provisional IRA. A particularly notorious group, based on the <!--del_lnk--> Shankill Road in the mid-1970s, became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Shankill Butchers. In all, over 1,500 people were killed in political violence in the city between 1969 and 2001.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Government">Government</span></h2>

       </div>
       <p>Belfast City Council is the <a href="../../wp/l/Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Local government in Northern Ireland">local authority</a> with responsibility for the city. The city's elected officials are the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Mayor of Belfast, Deputy Lord Mayor and <!--del_lnk--> High Sheriff who are elected from among 51 <!--del_lnk--> councillors. The first Lord Mayor of Belfast was Daniel Dixon, who was elected in 1892. The current <!--del_lnk--> Lord Mayor is Alderman Gavin Robinson of the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), while the Deputy Lord Mayor is Councillor Tierna Cunningham of <!--del_lnk--> Sinn F&eacute;in, both of whom were elected in June 2012 to serve a one-year term. The Lord Mayor's duties include presiding over meetings of the council, receiving distinguished visitors to the city, and representing and promoting the city on the national and international stage.</p>
       <p>In 1997, <!--del_lnk--> Unionists lost overall control of Belfast City Council for the first time in its history, with the <!--del_lnk--> Alliance Party of Northern Ireland gaining the balance of power between <!--del_lnk--> Nationalists and Unionists. This position was confirmed in the three subsequent council elections, with mayors from Nationalist Sinn F&eacute;in and <!--del_lnk--> Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and the cross-community Alliance Party regularly elected since. The first nationalist Lord Mayor of Belfast was Alban Maginness of the SDLP, in 1997.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> last elections to Belfast City Council were held on 5 May 2011, with the City's voters electing fifty-one councillors across <!--del_lnk--> nine district electoral areas. The election saw Nationalist councillors outnumber Unionist councillors for the first time, with Sinn F&eacute;in becoming the largest party: 16(+2) Sinn F&eacute;in, 15(-) <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 8(-) <!--del_lnk--> SDLP, 6(+2) <!--del_lnk--> Alliance Party, 3(&minus;4) <!--del_lnk--> Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 2 <!--del_lnk--> Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), and 1 Independent (a former deputy mayor who takes the UUP whip was a member of the defunct <!--del_lnk--> loyalist paramilitary linked-<!--del_lnk--> Ulster Democratic Party).</p>

       <p>As Northern Ireland's capital city, Belfast is host to the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Assembly at <!--del_lnk--> Stormont, the site of the <!--del_lnk--> devolved legislature for Northern Ireland. Belfast is divided into four <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Assembly and <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">UK parliamentary</a> constituencies: <!--del_lnk--> North Belfast, <!--del_lnk--> West Belfast, <!--del_lnk--> South Belfast and <!--del_lnk--> East Belfast. All four extend beyond the city boundaries to include parts of <!--del_lnk--> Castlereagh, <!--del_lnk--> Lisburn and <!--del_lnk--> Newtownabbey districts. In the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Assembly Elections in 2007, Belfast elected 24 <!--del_lnk--> Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), 6 from each <!--del_lnk--> constituency. Belfast elected 8 Sinn F&eacute;in, 6 <!--del_lnk--> DUP, 4 <!--del_lnk--> SDLP, 3 <!--del_lnk--> UUP, 2 <!--del_lnk--> Alliance Party, and 1 <!--del_lnk--> Progressive Unionist Party MLA.

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coat_of_arms_and_motto">Coat of arms and motto</span></h3>
       <div class="thumb tright">
       </div>
       <p>The city of Belfast has the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> motto "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Pro tanto quid retribuamus</i></span>." This is taken from <!--del_lnk--> Psalm 116 Verse 12 in the Latin <!--del_lnk--> Vulgate Bible and is literally "For (<i>Pro</i>) so much (<i>tanto</i>) what (<i>quid</i>) we shall repay (<i>retribuamus</i>)" The verse has been translated in bibles differently &ndash; for example as "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?". It is also translated as "In return for so much, what shall we give back?" The <!--del_lnk--> Queen's University Students' Union <!--del_lnk--> Rag Week publication <i>PTQ</i> derives its name from the first three words of the motto.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> coat of arms of the city are blazoned as <i>Party per fesse argent and azure, in chief a pile vair and on a canton gules a bell argent, in base a ship with sails set argent on waves of the sea proper</i>. This heraldic language describes a shield that is divided in two horizontally (<i>party per fesse</i>). The top (<i>chief</i>) of the shield is silver (<i>argent</i>), and has a point-down triangle (<i>a pile</i>) with a repeating blue-and-white pattern that represents fur (<i>vair</i>). There is also a red square in the top corner (<i>a canton gules</i>) on which there is a silver bell. It is likely that the bell is an example here of "canting" (or punning) heraldry, representing the first syllable of Belfast. In the lower part of the shield (<i>in base</i>) there is a silver sailing ship shown sailing on waves coloured in the actual colours of the sea (<i>proper</i>). The supporter on the "dexter" side (that is, the viewer's left) is a chained wolf, while on the "sinister" side the supporter is a sea-horse. The crest above the shield is also a sea-horse. These arms date back to 1613, when <a href="../../wp/j/James_VI_and_I.htm" title="James VI and I">King James I</a> granted Belfast town status. The seal was used by Belfast merchants throughout the 17th century on their signs and trade-coins. A large stained glass window in the <!--del_lnk--> City Hall displays the arms, where an explanation suggests that the seahorse and the ship refer to Belfast's significant maritime history. The wolf may be a tribute to the city's founder, <!--del_lnk--> Sir Arthur Chichester, and refer to his own coat of arms.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The city is flanked to the northwest by a series of hills, including <!--del_lnk--> Cavehill. Belfast is located at the western end of Belfast Lough and at the mouth of the River Lagan making it an ideal location for the shipbuilding industry that once made it famous. When the <a href="../../wp/r/RMS_Titanic.htm" title="RMS Titanic"><i>Titanic</i></a> was built in Belfast in 1911/1912, Harland and Wolff had the largest shipyard in the world. Belfast is situated on Northern Ireland's eastern <!--del_lnk--> coast at <span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><!--del_lnk--> <span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">54&deg;35&prime;49&Prime;N</span> <span class="longitude">05&deg;55&prime;45&Prime;W</span></span></span></span>. A consequence of this northern latitude is that it both endures short winter days and enjoys long summer evenings. During the <!--del_lnk--> winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, local sunset is before 16:00 while sunrise is around 08:45. This is balanced by the <!--del_lnk--> summer solstice in June, when the sun sets after 22:00 and rises before 05:00.</p>
       <p>In 1994, a <!--del_lnk--> weir was built across the river by the <!--del_lnk--> Laganside Corporation to raise the average water level so that it would cover the unseemly mud flats which gave Belfast its name (from <!--del_lnk--> Irish: <i>B&eacute;al Feirste</i> meaning "The sandy ford at the river mouth"). The area of Belfast Local Government District is 42.3 square miles (110&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> River Farset is also named after this <!--del_lnk--> silt deposit (from the Irish <i>feirste</i> meaning "sand spit"). Originally a more significant river than it is today, the Farset formed a dock on High Street until the mid 19th century. Bank Street in the <!--del_lnk--> city centre referred to the river bank and Bridge Street was named for the site of an early Farset bridge. Superseded by the River Lagan as the more important river in the city, the Farset now languishes in obscurity, under High Street. There are no less than eleven other minor rivers in and around Belfast, namely the Blackstaff, the Colin, the Connswater, the Cregagh, the Derriaghy, the Forth, the Knock, the Legoniel, the Milewater, the Purdysburn and the Ravernet.</p>
       <p>The city is flanked on the north and northwest by a series of hills, including <!--del_lnk--> Divis Mountain, <!--del_lnk--> Black Mountain and Cavehill thought to be the inspiration for <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Swift's <i><!--del_lnk--> Gulliver's Travels</i>. When Swift was living at Lilliput Cottage near the bottom of the Limestone Road in Belfast, he imagined that the Cavehill resembled the shape of a sleeping giant safeguarding the city. The shape of the giant's nose, known locally as <i>Napoleon's Nose</i>, is officially called McArt's Fort probably named after Art O'Neill, a 17th century chieftain who controlled the area at that time. The <!--del_lnk--> Castlereagh Hills overlook the city on the southeast.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
       <p>As with the rest of Ireland, Belfast has a <!--del_lnk--> temperate climate, with a narrow range of temperatures, often windy conditions, and rainfall throughout the year. There are currently 5 weather observing stations in the Belfast area: Helens Bay, Stormont, Newforge, Castlereagh, and Ravenhill Road. Slightly further afield is Aldergrove Airport.</p>
       <p>The highest temperature recorded at any official weather station in the Belfast area was <span style="white-space:nowrap;">30.8 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(87&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> at Shaws Bridge on 12 July 1983. This is also the highest temperature recorded across <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Belfast also holds the record for Northern Ireland's warmest night time minimum, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">19.6 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(67.3&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> at Whitehouse on 14 August 2001.</p>
       <p>The city gets significant precipitation (greater than 0.01&nbsp;in/0.25&nbsp;mm) on 213 days in an average year with an average annual rainfall of 846 millimetres (33.3&nbsp;in), less than the <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_District.htm#Climate" title="Lake District">Lake District</a> or the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Highlands.htm" title="Scottish Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a>, but higher than <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> or the south-east coast of Ireland. As an urban and coastal area, Belfast typically gets snow on fewer than 10 days per year.</p>
       <p>The absolute maximum temperature at the weather station at Stormont is <span style="white-space:nowrap;">29.7 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(85&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, set during July 1983. In an average year the warmest day will rise to a temperature of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">24.4 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(75.9&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> with a day of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">25.1 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(77.2&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> or above occurring roughly once every two in three years.</p>
       <p>The absolute minimum temperature at Stormont is <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;9.9 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(14&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, during January 1982, although in an average year the coldest night will fall no lower than <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;4.5 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(24&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> with air frost being recorded on just 26 nights.

       <p>The nearest weather station for which sunshine data and longer term observations are available is <!--del_lnk--> Belfast International Airport (<!--del_lnk--> Aldergrove). Perhaps not surprisingly, temperature extremes here have slightly more variability due to the more inland location. The average warmest day at Aldergrove for example will reach a temperature of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">25.4 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(77.7&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, (1.0 Celsius higher than Stormont) and 2.1 days should attain a temperature of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">25.1 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(77.2&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> or above in total. Conversely the coldest night of the year averages <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;6.6 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(20.1&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> (or 1.9 celius lower the Stormont) and 39 nights should register an air frost. Some 13 more frosty nights than Stormont. The minimum temperature at Aldergrove was <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;14.2 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(6&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, during December 2010.</p>

       <p>Belfast expanded very rapidly from being a market town to becoming an industrial city during the course of the 19th century. Because of this, it is less an agglomeration of villages and towns which have expanded into each other, than other comparable cities, such as <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> or <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>. The city expanded to the natural barrier of the hills that surround it, overwhelming other settlements. Consequently, the arterial roads along which this expansion took place (such as the <!--del_lnk--> Falls Road or the <!--del_lnk--> Newtownards Road) are more significant in defining the districts of the city than nucleated settlements. Belfast remains segregated by walls, commonly known as "<!--del_lnk--> peace lines", erected by the <!--del_lnk--> British Army after August 1969, and which still divide 14 districts in the inner city. In 2008 a process was proposed for the removal of the 'peace walls'. In June 2007, a <a href="../../wp/p/Pound_sterling.htm" title="Pound sterling">&pound;</a>16 million programme was announced which will transform and redevelop streets and public spaces in the city centre. Major arterial roads (<!--del_lnk--> quality bus corridor) into the city include the <!--del_lnk--> Antrim Road, <!--del_lnk--> Shore Road, Holywood Road, Newtownards Road, Castlereagh Road, Cregagh Road, <!--del_lnk--> Ormeau Road, <!--del_lnk--> Malone Road, <!--del_lnk--> Lisburn Road, Falls Road, <!--del_lnk--> Springfield Road, <!--del_lnk--> Shankill Road, and Crumlin Road.</p>
       <p>Belfast city centre is divided into two postcode districts, <i>BT1</i> for the area lying north of the City Hall, and <i>BT2</i> for the area to its south. The industrial estate and docklands <i>BT3</i>. The rest of the Belfast <!--del_lnk--> post town is divided in a broadly <!--del_lnk--> clockwise system from <i>BT3</i> in the north-east round to <i>BT15</i>, with <i>BT16</i> and <i>BT17</i> further out to the east and west respectively. Although <i>BT</i> derives from <i>Belfast</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> BT postcode area extends across the whole of Northern Ireland.</p>
       <p>Since 2001, boosted by increasing numbers of tourists, the city council has developed a number of cultural <!--del_lnk--> quarters. The <b><!--del_lnk--> Cathedral Quarter</b> takes its name from <!--del_lnk--> St Anne's Cathedral (Church of Ireland) and has taken on the mantle of the city's key cultural locality. It hosts a yearly <!--del_lnk--> visual and performing arts festival.</p>
       <p>Custom House Square is one of the city's main outdoor venues for free concerts and street entertainment. The <b><!--del_lnk--> Gaeltacht Quarter</b> is an area around the Falls Road in west Belfast which promotes and encourages the use of the <!--del_lnk--> Irish language. The <b><!--del_lnk--> Queen's Quarter</b> in south Belfast is named after <!--del_lnk--> Queen's University. The area has a large student population and hosts the annual <!--del_lnk--> Belfast Festival at Queen's each autumn. It is home to <!--del_lnk--> Botanic Gardens and the <!--del_lnk--> Ulster Museum, which was reopened in 2009 after major redevelopment. <!--del_lnk--> The Golden Mile is the name given to the mile between Belfast City Hall and Queen's University. Taking in Dublin Road, <!--del_lnk--> Great Victoria Street, <!--del_lnk--> Shaftesbury Square and Bradbury Place, it contains some of the best bars and restaurants in the city. Since the <!--del_lnk--> Good Friday Agreement in 1998, the nearby Lisburn Road has developed into the city's most exclusive shopping strip. Finally, the <b><!--del_lnk--> Titanic Quarter</b> covers 0.75&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (0&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of reclaimed land adjacent to <!--del_lnk--> Belfast Harbour, formerly known as <i>Queen's Island</i>. Named after <i><a href="../../wp/r/RMS_Titanic.htm" title="RMS Titanic">RMS Titanic</a></i>, which was built here in 1912, work has begun which promises to transform some former shipyard land into "one of the largest waterfront developments in Europe". Plans also include apartments, a riverside entertainment district, and a major Titanic-themed museum.</p>

       <p>The architectural style of Belfast's buildings range from <!--del_lnk--> Edwardian, like the City Hall, to modern, like <!--del_lnk--> Waterfront Hall. Many of the city's <!--del_lnk--> Victorian landmarks, including the main <i>Lanyon Building</i> at <!--del_lnk--> Queen's University Belfast and the <!--del_lnk--> Linenhall Library, were designed by <!--del_lnk--> Sir Charles Lanyon.</p>
       <p>The City Hall was finished in 1906 and was built to reflect Belfast's city status, granted by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Queen_Victoria.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> in 1888. The <!--del_lnk--> Edwardian architectural style of Belfast City Hall influenced the <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Memorial in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/k/Kolkata.htm" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, India, and <a href="../../wp/d/Durban.htm" title="Durban">Durban</a> City Hall in South Africa. The dome is 173&nbsp;ft (53&nbsp;m) high and figures above the door state "<!--del_lnk--> Hibernia encouraging and promoting the Commerce and Arts of the City". Among the city's grandest buildings are two former banks: <!--del_lnk--> Ulster Bank in Waring Street (built in 1860) and <!--del_lnk--> Northern Bank, in nearby Donegall Street (built in 1769). The <!--del_lnk--> Royal Courts of Justice in Chichester Street are home to Northern Ireland's <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court. Many of Belfast's oldest buildings are found in the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral Quarter area, which is currently undergoing redevelopment as the city's main cultural and tourist area. Windsor House, 262&nbsp;ft (80&nbsp;m) high, has 23 floors and is the second tallest building (as distinct from structure) in Ireland. Work has started on the taller <!--del_lnk--> Obel Tower, which already surpasses the height of Windsor House in its unfinished state. In 2007, plans were approved for the <!--del_lnk--> Aurora building. At 37 storeys and 358&nbsp;ft (109 m) high, this will surpass both previous buildings.</p>

       <p>The ornately decorated <!--del_lnk--> Crown Liquor Saloon, designed by Joseph Anderson in 1876, in Great Victoria Street is the only bar in the UK owned by the <!--del_lnk--> National Trust. It was made internationally famous as the setting for the classic film, <i><!--del_lnk--> Odd Man Out</i>, starring <!--del_lnk--> James Mason. The restaurant panels in the Crown Bar were originally made for <i>Britannic</i>, the sister ship of the <i>Titanic</i>, built in Belfast. The Harland and Wolff shipyard is now the location of the world's largest <!--del_lnk--> dry dock, where the giant cranes, <!--del_lnk--> Samson and Goliath stand out against Belfast's skyline. Including the Waterfront Hall and the <!--del_lnk--> Odyssey Arena, Belfast has several other venues for performing arts. The architecture of the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Opera House has an oriental theme and was completed in 1895. It was bombed several times during the Troubles but has now been restored to its former glory. <!--del_lnk--> The Lyric Theatre, (re-opened 1 May 2011 after undergoing a rebuilding programme) the only full-time producing theatre in the country, is where film star <!--del_lnk--> Liam Neeson began his career. The <!--del_lnk--> Ulster Hall (1859&ndash;1862) was originally designed for grand dances but is now used primarily as a concert and sporting venue. <!--del_lnk--> Lloyd George, <!--del_lnk--> Parnell and <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Pearse all attended political rallies there.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Parks_and_gardens">Parks and gardens</span></h3>
       <p>Sitting at the mouth of the River Lagan where it becomes a deep and sheltered lough, Belfast is surrounded by mountains that create a micro-climate conducive to horticulture. From the Victorian Botanic Gardens in the heart of the city to the heights of Cave Hill Country Park, the great expanse of Lagan Valley Regional Park to Colin Glen, Belfast contains an abundance of parkland and forest parks.</p>
       <p>Parks and Gardens are an integral part of Belfast's heritage, and home to an abundance of local wildlife and popular places for a picnic, a stroll or a jog. Numerous events take place throughout including festivals such as Rose Week and special activities such as bird watching evenings and great beast hunts.</p>
       <p>Belfast has over forty public parks. The Forest of Belfast is a partnership between government and local groups, set up in 1992 to manage and conserve the city's parks and open spaces. They have commissioned more than 30 public sculptures since 1993. In 2006, the <!--del_lnk--> City Council set aside &pound;8 million to continue this work. The <!--del_lnk--> Belfast Naturalists' Field Club was founded in 1863 and is administered by National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland.</p>

       <p>With 700,000 visitors in 2005, one of the most popular parks is <!--del_lnk--> Botanic Gardens in the <!--del_lnk--> Queen's Quarter. Built in the 1830s and designed by <!--del_lnk--> Sir Charles Lanyon, Botanic Gardens Palm House is one of the earliest examples of a curvilinear and cast iron <!--del_lnk--> glasshouse. Other attractions in the park include the Tropical Ravine, a humid jungle glen built in 1889, rose gardens and public events ranging from live opera broadcasts to pop concerts. <a href="../../wp/u/U2.htm" title="U2">U2</a> played here in 1997. <!--del_lnk--> Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park, to the south of the city centre, attracts thousands of visitors each year to its International Rose Garden. Rose Week in July each year features over 20,000 blooms. It has an area of 128 acres (0.52&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of meadows, woodland and gardens and features a <!--del_lnk--> Princess Diana Memorial Garden, a Japanese Garden, a walled garden, and the Golden Crown Fountain commissioned in 2002 as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations.</p>
       <p>In 2008, Belfast was named a finalist in the Large City (200,001 and over) category of the <!--del_lnk--> RHS <!--del_lnk--> Britain in Bloom competition along with <!--del_lnk--> London Borough of Croydon and <a href="../../wp/s/Sheffield.htm" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Belfast Zoo is owned by Belfast City Council. The council spends &pound;1.5 million every year on running and promoting the zoo, which is one of the few local government-funded zoos in the UK and Ireland. The Zoo is one of the top visitor attraction in Northern Ireland, receiving more than 295,000 visitors a year. The majority of the animals are in danger in their natural habitat. The zoo houses more than 1,200 animals of 140 species including <!--del_lnk--> Asian Elephants, <a href="../../wp/b/Barbary_lion.htm" title="Barbary lion">Barbary Lions</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> White Tigers (one of the few in the United Kingdom), three species of penguin, a family of <!--del_lnk--> Western Lowland Gorillas, a troop of <!--del_lnk--> Common Chimpanzees, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Red_panda.htm" title="Red Panda">Red Panda</a> and several species of <!--del_lnk--> langur.

       <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 census, the population within the city limits (the Belfast Urban Area) was 276,459, while 579,554 people lived in the wider <!--del_lnk--> Belfast Metropolitan Area. This made it the <!--del_lnk--> fifteenth-largest city in the United Kingdom, but the <!--del_lnk--> eleventh-largest conurbation. Belfast experienced a huge growth in population around the first half of the twentieth century. This rise slowed and peaked around the start of the Troubles with the 1971 census showing almost 600,000 people in the <i>Belfast Urban Area</i>. Since then, the inner city numbers have dropped dramatically as people have moved to swell the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Belfast suburb population. The 2001 census population within the same Urban Area, had fallen to 277,391 people, with 579,554 people living in the wider <!--del_lnk--> Belfast Metropolitan Area. The 2001 census records roughly 81,650 people from Catholic backgrounds and 79,650 people from Protestant backgrounds of working age living in Belfast. The population density in the same year was 2,415 people/km&sup2; (compared to 119 for the rest of Northern Ireland). As with many cities, Belfast's inner city is currently characterised by the elderly, students and single young people, while families tend to live on the periphery. Socio-economic areas radiate out from the <!--del_lnk--> Central Business District, with a pronounced wedge of affluence extending out the <!--del_lnk--> Malone Road and Upper Malone Road to the south. An area of greater deprivation extends to the west of the city. The areas around the <!--del_lnk--> Falls and <!--del_lnk--> Shankill Roads are the most deprived wards in Northern Ireland.</p>
       <p>Despite a period of relative peace, most areas and districts of Belfast still reflect the divided nature of Northern Ireland as a whole. Many areas are still highly segregated along ethnic, political and religious lines, especially in working-class neighbourhoods. These zones &ndash; '<!--del_lnk--> Catholic' or '<!--del_lnk--> Republican' on one side and 'Protestant', or '<!--del_lnk--> Loyalist' on the other &ndash; are invariably marked by <!--del_lnk--> flags, <!--del_lnk--> graffiti and <!--del_lnk--> murals. Segregation has been present throughout the history of Belfast, but has been maintained and increased by each outbreak of violence in the city. This escalation in segregation, described as a "ratchet effect", has shown little sign of decreasing during times of peace. When violence flares, it tends to be in interface areas. The highest levels of segregation in the city are in west Belfast with many areas greater than 90% Catholic. Opposite but comparatively high levels are seen in the predominantly Protestant east Belfast. Areas where segregated working-class areas meet are known as <!--del_lnk--> interface areas.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Ethnic minority communities have been in Belfast since the 1930s. The largest groups are Chinese and <!--del_lnk--> Irish travellers. Since the expansion of the European Union, numbers have been boosted by an influx of Eastern European immigrants. Census figures (2001) showed that Belfast has a total ethnic minority population of 4,584 or 1.3% of the population. Over half of these live in south Belfast, where they comprise 2.63% of the population.

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> IRA Ceasefire in 1994 and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 have given investors increased confidence to invest in Belfast. This has led to a period of sustained economic growth and large-scale redevelopment of the city centre. Developments include <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Square, the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral Quarter, and the <!--del_lnk--> Laganside with the <!--del_lnk--> Odyssey complex and the landmark Waterfront Hall.</p>

Today, Belfast is Northern Ireland's educational and commercial hub. In February 2006, Belfast's unemployment rate stood at 4.2%, lower than both the Northern Ireland and the UK average of 5.5%. Over the past 10 years employment has grown by 16.4 per cent, compared with 9.2 per cent for the UK as a whole.</p>
       <p>Northern Ireland's <!--del_lnk--> peace dividend has led to soaring property prices in the city. In 2007, Belfast saw house prices grow by 50%, the fastest rate of growth in the UK. In March 2007, the average house in Belfast cost &pound;91,819, with the average in south Belfast being &pound;141,000. In 2004, Belfast had the lowest owner occupation rate in Northern Ireland at 54%.</p>
       <p>Peace has also boosted the numbers of tourists coming to Belfast. There were 6.4 million visitors in 2005, which was a growth of 8.5% from 2004. The visitors spent &pound;285.2 million, supporting more than 15,600 jobs. Visitor numbers rose by 6% to reach 6.8 million in 2006, with tourists spending &pound;324 million, an increase of 15% on 2005. The city's two airports have helped make the city one of the most visited weekend destinations in Europe.</p>
       <p>Belfast has been the fastest-growing economy of the thirty largest British cities over the past decade, a new economy report by Howard Spencer has found. <i>"That's because [of] the fundamentals of the UK economy and [because] people actually want to invest in the UK,"</i> he commented on that report.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> Radio 4's World reported furthermore that despite higher levels of corporation tax in the UK than in the Republic. There are "huge amounts" of foreign investment coming into the country.</p>
       <p><i><!--del_lnk--> The Times</i> wrote about Belfast's growing economy: "According to the region's development agency, throughout the 1990s Northern Ireland had the fastest-growing regional economy in the UK, with GDP increasing 1 per cent per annum faster than the rest of the country. As with any modern economy, the service sector is vital to Northern Ireland's development and is enjoying excellent growth. In particular, the region has a booming tourist industry with record levels of visitors and tourist revenues and has also established itself as a significant location for call centres." Since the ending of the regions conflict tourism has boomed in Northern Ireland, greatly aided by low cost.</p>

       <p>When the population of Belfast town began to grow in the 17th century, its economy was built on commerce. It provided a market for the surrounding countryside and the natural inlet of <!--del_lnk--> Belfast Lough gave the city its own port. The port supplied an avenue for trade with Great Britain and later Europe and North America. In the mid-17th century, Belfast exported beef, butter, hides, tallow and corn and it imported coal, cloth, wine, brandy, paper, timber and tobacco. Around this time, the linen trade in Northern Ireland blossomed and by the middle of the 18th century, one fifth of all the linen exported from Ireland was shipped from Belfast. The present city however is a product of the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. It was not until industry transformed the linen and shipbuilding trades that the economy and the population boomed. By the turn of the 19th century, Belfast had transformed into the largest linen producing centre in the world, earning the nickname "<!--del_lnk--> Linenopolis".</p>
       <p>Belfast harbour was dredged in 1845 to provide deeper berths for larger ships. Donegall Quay was built out into the river as the harbour was developed further and trade flourished. The <!--del_lnk--> Harland and Wolff shipbuilding firm was created in 1861, and by the time the <i><a href="../../wp/r/RMS_Titanic.htm" title="RMS Titanic">Titanic</a></i> was built, in 1912, it had become the largest shipyard in the world.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Short Brothers plc is a British aerospace company based in Belfast. It was the first aircraft manufacturing company in the world. The company began its association with Belfast in 1936, with Short &amp; Harland Ltd, a venture jointly owned by Shorts and Harland and Wolff. Now known as Shorts Bombardier it works as an international aircraft manufacturer located near the Port of Belfast. The rise of mass-produced and cotton clothing following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> were some of the factors which led to the decline of Belfast's international linen trade. Like many British cities dependent on traditional heavy industry, Belfast suffered serious decline since the 1960s, exacerbated greatly in the 1970s and 1980s by the Troubles. More than 100,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since the 1970s. For several decades, Northern Ireland's fragile economy required significant public support from the <!--del_lnk--> British exchequer of up to &pound;4 billion per year. Ongoing sectarian violence has made it difficult for Belfast to compete with Dublin's <!--del_lnk--> Celtic Tiger economy. This has meant that wage rates in Belfast and Northern Ireland until recently were significantly lower than those in the Republic of Ireland. The effect of the economic depression in the Irish Republic on wage levels is not yet fully apparent. The cost of living in Northern Ireland is significantly lower than in the Republic and this has created a retail boom in border towns and cities.</p>

       <p>Belfast is a relatively car-dependent city by European standards, with an extensive road network including the 22.5 miles (36&nbsp;km) <!--del_lnk--> M2 and <!--del_lnk--> M22 motorway route. A recent survey of how people travel in Northern Ireland showed that people in Belfast made 77% of all journeys by car, 11% by public transport and 6% on foot. It also showed that Belfast has 0.70 cars per household compared to figures of 1.18 in the East and 1.14 in the West of Northern Ireland. A road improvement-scheme in Belfast began early in 2006, with the upgrading of two junctions along the <!--del_lnk--> Westlink dual-carriageway to <!--del_lnk--> grade-separated standard. The improvement scheme was completed five months ahead of schedule on February 2009, with the official opening taking place on 4 March 2009. Commentators have argued that this may create a bottleneck at York Street, the next <!--del_lnk--> at-grade intersection, until that too is upgraded. On 25 October 2012 the stage 2 report for the York Street intersection was approved and in December 2012 the planned upgrade moved into stage 3 of the development process. If successfully completing the necessary statutory procedures, work on a grade separated junction to connect the Westlink to the M2/M3 motorways is scheduled to take place between 2014 and 2018, creating a continuous link between the M1 and M2, the two main motorways in Northern Ireland.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Black taxis are common in the city, operating on a <!--del_lnk--> share basis in some areas. These are outnumbered by <!--del_lnk--> private hire taxis. Bus and rail public transport in Northern Ireland is operated by subsidiaries of <!--del_lnk--> Translink. Bus services in the city proper and the nearer suburbs are operated by <!--del_lnk--> Translink Metro, with services focusing on linking residential districts with the city centre on 12 <!--del_lnk--> quality bus corridors running along main radial roads, resulting in poor connections between different suburban areas. More distant suburbs are served by <!--del_lnk--> Ulsterbus. <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Railways provides <!--del_lnk--> suburban services along three lines running through Belfast's northern suburbs to <!--del_lnk--> Carrickfergus and <!--del_lnk--> Larne, eastwards towards <!--del_lnk--> Bangor and south-westwards towards <!--del_lnk--> Lisburn and <!--del_lnk--> Portadown. This service is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Belfast Suburban Rail system. Belfast also has a direct rail connection with <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> called <i><!--del_lnk--> Enterprise</i> which is operated jointly by NIR and <!--del_lnk--> Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the state railway company of the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>.</p>
       <p>In April 2008, the <!--del_lnk--> Department for Regional Development reported on a plan for a light-rail system, similar to that in <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>. The consultants said Belfast does not have the population to support a light rail system, suggesting that investment in bus-based rapid transit would be preferable.The study found that bus-based rapid transit produces positive economic results, but light rail does not. The report by Atkins &amp; KPMG, however, said there would be the option of migrating to light rail in the future should the demand increase.</p>
       <p>The city has two airports: the <!--del_lnk--> Belfast International Airport offers domestic, European flights and 1 transatlantic flight to Newark, NJ provided by United Airlines and is located north-west of the city, near Lough Neagh, while the <!--del_lnk--> George Best Belfast City Airport, which is closer to the city centre by train from <!--del_lnk--> Sydenham on the <!--del_lnk--> Bangor Line, adjacent to Belfast Lough, offers UK domestic flights and a few European flights. In 2005, Belfast International Airport was the 11th busiest commercial airport in the UK, accounting for just over 2% of all UK terminal passengers while the George Best Belfast City Airport was the 16th busiest and had 1% of UK terminal passengers. The Belfast &ndash; Liverpool route is the busiest domestic flight route in the UK excluding London with 555,224 passengers in 2009. Over 2.2 million passengers also flew between Belfast and London in 2009.</p>
       <p>Belfast has a large port which is used for exporting and importing goods, and for passenger ferry services. <!--del_lnk--> Stena Line run regular routes to <!--del_lnk--> Cairnryan, <!--del_lnk--> Loch Ryan, <!--del_lnk--> Wigtownshire in Scotland using its HSS (High Speed Service) vessel &ndash; with a crossing time of around 90 minutes &ndash; and/or its conventional vessel &ndash; with a crossing time of around 3 hours 45 minutes. <!--del_lnk--> Norfolkline &ndash; formally Norse Merchant Ferries &ndash; offers a passenger/cargo ferry to and from <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, with a crossing time of 8 hours and a seasonal sailing to <!--del_lnk--> Douglas, Isle of Man is operated by the <!--del_lnk--> Isle of Man Steam Packet Company.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Culture">Culture</span></h2>
       <p>Belfast's population is evenly split between its Protestant and Catholic residents. These two distinct cultural communities have both contributed significantly to the city's culture. Throughout the Troubles, Belfast artists continued to express themselves through poetry, art and music. In the period since the <!--del_lnk--> Good Friday Agreement in 1998, Belfast has begun a social, economic and cultural transformation giving it a growing international cultural reputation. In 2003, Belfast had an unsuccessful bid for the 2008 <!--del_lnk--> European Capital of Culture. The bid was run by an independent company, <i>Imagine Belfast</i>, who boasted that it would "make Belfast the meeting place of Europe's legends, where the meaning of history and belief find a home and a sanctuary from caricature, parody and oblivion." According to <i><!--del_lnk--> The Guardian</i> the bid may have been undermined by the <!--del_lnk--> city's history and volatile politics.</p>
       <p>In 2004&ndash;05, art and cultural events in Belfast were attended by 1.8 million people (400,000 more than the previous year). The same year, 80,000 people participated in culture and other arts activities, twice as many as in 2003&ndash;04. A combination of relative peace, international investment and an active promotion of arts and culture is attracting more tourists to Belfast than ever before. In 2004&ndash;05, 5.9 million people visited Belfast, a 10% increase from the previous year, and spent &pound;262.5 million.</p>

       <p>Like all areas of the island of Ireland outside of the <!--del_lnk--> Gaeltacht, the Irish language in Belfast is not that of an unbroken intergenerational transmission. Due to community activity in the 1960s, including the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Shaws Road Gaeltacht community, the expanse in the Irish language arts, and the advancements made in the availability of Irish medium education throughout the city, it can now be said that there is a 'mother-tongue' community of speakers. The language is heavily promoted in the city and is particularly visible in the Falls Road area, where the signs on both the iconic black taxis and on the public buses are bilingual. Belfast has the highest concentration of Irish speakers in Northern Ireland. Projects to promote the language in the city are funded by various sources, notably <!--del_lnk--> Foras na Gaeilge, an all-Ireland body funded by both the Irish and British governments. There are a number Irish language Primary schools and one secondary school in Belfast. The provision of certain resources for these schools (for example, such as the provision of textbooks) is supported by the charitable organisation TACA.</p>
