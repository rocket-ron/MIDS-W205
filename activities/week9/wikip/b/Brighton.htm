       <p><b>Brighton</b> (<small>pronounced&nbsp;</small><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> /&#x2C8;bra&#x26A;t&#x259;n/</span>) is the major part of the city of <!--del_lnk--> Brighton and Hove (formed from the previous towns of Brighton, <!--del_lnk--> Hove, <!--del_lnk--> Portslade and several other villages) in <!--del_lnk--> East Sussex on the south coast of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. For administrative purposes, Brighton and Hove is not part of the <!--del_lnk--> non-metropolitan county of East Sussex, but remains part of the <!--del_lnk--> ceremonial county of East Sussex, within the historic County of Sussex.</p>
       <p>The ancient settlement of <i>Brighthelmstone</i> dates from before <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> (1086), but it emerged as a health resort featuring <!--del_lnk--> sea bathing during the 18th century and became a destination for <!--del_lnk--> day-trippers from London after the arrival of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Railway">railway</a> in 1841. Brighton experienced rapid population growth, reaching a peak of over 160,000 by 1961. Modern Brighton forms part of the <!--del_lnk--> Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation stretching along the coast, with a population of around 480,000.</p>
       <p>Brighton has long been renowned throughout the UK and Europe as <!--del_lnk--> gay-friendly, and is home to a large <!--del_lnk--> LGBT community. Eight million tourists a year visit Brighton. The city has a substantial <!--del_lnk--> business conference industry regularly hosting the <a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Labour_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Conservative_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade Union">Trade Union</a> annual conferences. Brighton has two universities and a medical school.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In the <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a>, Brighton was called <i>Bristelmestune</i>  and a rent of 4,000 <!--del_lnk--> herring was established. In June 1514 <i>Brighthelmstone</i> was burnt to the ground by French raiders during a war between England and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. Only part of the <!--del_lnk--> St Nicholas Church and the street pattern of the area now known as "<!--del_lnk--> The Lanes" survived. The first drawing of Brighthelmstone was made in 1545 and depicts what is believed to be the raid of 1514. During the 1740s and 1750s, <!--del_lnk--> Dr Richard Russell of <!--del_lnk--> Lewes began prescribing <a href="../../wp/s/Seawater.htm" title="Seawater">seawater</a> at Brighton.</p>
       <p>By 1780, development of the <!--del_lnk--> Georgian terraces had started and the fishing village became the fashionable <!--del_lnk--> resort of Brighton. Growth of the town was further encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later <a href="../../wp/g/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">King George IV</a>) after his first visit in 1783. He spent much of his leisure time in the town and constructed the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Pavilion during the early part of his <!--del_lnk--> Regency. Although contracted forms of the name are attested since the 15th Century, it was not until this period that the modern form of the name came into common use.</p>
       <p>The arrival of the railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day-trippers from <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and population growth from around 7,000 in 1801 to over 120,000 by 1901. The <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era saw the building of many major attractions including the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Hotel (1864), the <!--del_lnk--> West Pier (1866) and the <!--del_lnk--> Palace Pier (1899). Prior to either of these structures the famous Chain Pier was built, to the designs of Captain Samuel Brown. It lasted from 1823 to 1896, and featured in paintings by both Turner and Constable.</p>
       <p>After boundary changes between 1873 and 1952, the land area of Brighton increased from <span style="white-space:nowrap">1,640&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>)</span> in 1854 to <span style="white-space:nowrap">14,347&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(58&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>)</span> in 1952. New housing estates were established in the acquired areas including <!--del_lnk--> Moulsecoomb, <!--del_lnk--> Bevendean, <!--del_lnk--> Coldean and <!--del_lnk--> Whitehawk. The major expansion of 1928 also incorporated the villages of <!--del_lnk--> Patcham, <!--del_lnk--> Ovingdean and <!--del_lnk--> Rottingdean, and much council housing was built in parts of <!--del_lnk--> Woodingdean after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>.</p>
       <p>More recently, <!--del_lnk--> gentrification of much of Brighton has seen a return of the fashionable image which characterised the growth of the Regency period. Recent housing in the <!--del_lnk--> North Laine, for instance, has been designed in keeping with the area.</p>
       <p>In 1997 Brighton and Hove were joined to form the <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority of <!--del_lnk--> Brighton and Hove, which was granted <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city status</a> by Queen <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a> as part of the <!--del_lnk--> millennium celebrations in 2000.</p>
       <p>Brighton is sometimes referred to as London-by-the-sea.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Royal Pavilion is a former royal palace built as a home for the Prince Regent during the early 19th century, under the direction of the architect John Nash, and is notable for its <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Saracenic architecture and Oriental interior. Other Indo-Saracenic buildings in Brighton include the <!--del_lnk--> Sassoon Mausoleum, now, with the bodies reburied elsewhere, in use as a chic supper club.</p>
       <p>Brighton Marine Palace and Pier ( long known as the Palace Pier) opened in 1899. It features a <!--del_lnk--> funfair, restaurants and arcade halls.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> West Pier was built in 1866 and has been closed since 1975 awaiting renovation, which faces continual setbacks, The West Pier is one of only two Grade I <!--del_lnk--> listed piers in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, but suffered two fires in 2003. Plans for a new landmark in its place &ndash; the <!--del_lnk--> i360, a 183&nbsp;m (600&nbsp;ft) observation tower designed by <a href="../../wp/l/London_Eye.htm" title="London Eye">London Eye</a> architects Marks Barfield &ndash; were announced in June 2006. Plans were approved by the council on 11 October 2006. As of early 2009, construction had yet to begin, but the area has been cordoned off.</p>
       <p>Created in 1883, <!--del_lnk--> Volk's Electric Railway runs along the inland edge of the beach from Brighton Pier to <!--del_lnk--> Black Rock and <!--del_lnk--> Brighton Marina. It is the world's oldest operating <!--del_lnk--> electric railway.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Grand Hotel was built in 1864 and the scene of the <!--del_lnk--> 1984 Brighton Hotel Bombing. Its nighttime blue lighting is particularly prominent along the foreshore. </p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Churches_and_places_of_worship">Churches and places of worship</span></h3>
       <p>The 11th century <!--del_lnk--> St Nicholas Church is the oldest building in Brighton, commonly known as "The Mother Church". Other notable churches include the large brick-built <!--del_lnk--> St Bartholomew's, and <!--del_lnk--> St Peter's in the heart of Brighton on an island between the Lewes Road and the London Road.</p>
       <p>There are four synagogues in the Brighton area, including the Brighton &amp; Hove Progressive Synagogue (Liberal) at 6 Landsdowne Road in Hove; <!--del_lnk--> Brighton and Hove Hebrew Congregation at 66 Middle Street in Brighton (Orthodox), <!--del_lnk--> Hove Hebrew Congregation at 79 Holland Road in Hove (Orthodox) and <!--del_lnk--> Brighton &amp; Hove Reform Synagogue on Palmeira Avenue in Hove (Reformed). <!--del_lnk--> Middle Street Synagogue, Brighton is an important Grade II listed building built in 1874&ndash;75, and one of the most beautiful small synagogues in Europe. It is presently in the process of being gradually restored by <!--del_lnk--> English Heritage. About 12% of the population of the Brighton &amp; Hove conurbation are of Jewish ancestry, with a little less than half presently practicing some form of Judaism, according to a 2007 study by the European Jewish Press.</p>
       <p>Nevertheless, Brighton has become known as one of the least religious places in the UK, based upon analysis of the 2001 <!--del_lnk--> census which revealed that 66,955 people (27 per cent of the population) profess no religion, almost double the national average of 15 per cent. As part of the <!--del_lnk--> Jedi census phenomenon, 2.6 per cent claimed their religion was Jedi Knight.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The seafront has bars, restaurants, nightclubs and amusement arcades, principally between the piers. Being less than an hour from London by train has made the city a popular destination. Brighton beach has a <!--del_lnk--> nudist area (south of the easterly part of <!--del_lnk--> Kemptown). Brighton's beach, which is a <!--del_lnk--> shingle beach up to the mean low tide mark, has been awarded a <!--del_lnk--> blue flag. The <!--del_lnk--> Monarch's Way long-distance footpath heads west along the seafront above the beach. Ohso Social is a former deck chair arch that has been transformed into a bar and restaurant.</p>
       <p>Since the 1978 demolition of the open-air lido at Black Rock, the most easterly part of Brighton's seafront, the area has been developed and now features one of Europe's largest <!--del_lnk--> marinas. However, the site of the pool itself remains empty except for a skate park and graffiti wall, and further development is planned including a high-rise hotel which has aroused debate, mirroring proposals for the <!--del_lnk--> King Alfred leisure centre in Hove, which were pulled in 2008. In addition, part of the eastern side of the beach has been redeveloped into a sports complex, which has courts for anything from <!--del_lnk--> beach volleyball to <!--del_lnk--> ultimate Frisbee, and opened to the public in March 2007.<br style="clear:both;" />

       <p>Each May the city hosts the <!--del_lnk--> Brighton Festival, the second largest arts festival in the UK (<!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh). This includes processions such as the Children's Parade, outdoor spectaculars often involving pyrotechnics, and theatre, music and visual arts in venues throughout the city, some brought into this use exclusively for the festival. The earliest feature of the festival, <!--del_lnk--> the Artists' Open Houses, are homes of artists and craftspeople opened to the public as galleries, and usually selling the work of the occupants. Since 2002, these have been organized independently of the official Festival and Fringe.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Brighton Festival Fringe runs alongside Brighton Festival, and has grown to be the second largest fringe festival in the world. Together with the street performers from Brighton Festival's "Streets of Brighton" events, and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Mile-esque outdoor performances that make up "Fringe City", outdoor spectacles and events more than double during May.</p>
       <p>Other festivals include 'The Great Escape in May', featuring three nights of live music in venues across the city; the Soundwaves Festival in June, which shows classical music composed in the 21st Century, and involves both amateur and professional performers; Paddle Round The Pier; Brighton Live which each September stages a week of free gigs in pubs to show local bands; <!--del_lnk--> Burning the Clocks, a winter solstice celebration; and <!--del_lnk--> Brighton Pride (see lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, below). The <!--del_lnk--> Kemptown area has its own small annual street festival, the Kemptown Carnival, and the <!--del_lnk--> Hanover area similarly has a "Hanover Day". Beachdown Festival, started in 2008 has recently ceased operations due to financial difficulties.</p>
       <p>An inaugural White Nights (<!--del_lnk--> Nuit Blanche) all-night arts festival took place in October 2008. 2009 saw the first Brighton Zine Fest celebrating <!--del_lnk--> zine and <!--del_lnk--> D.I.Y. culture within the city.</p>

The Lanes contain predominantly clothing stores, jewellers, antique shops, restaurants and pubs. The <!--del_lnk--> North Laine area is a retail, leisure and residential area immediately north of The Lanes. Its name derives from the Anglo-Saxon "Laine" meaning "fields". The North Laine contains a mix of businesses dominated by caf&eacute;s, independent and avant-garde shops, bars and theatres.</p>
