The Soviet defensive effort frustrated <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>'s attack on <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, capital of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</a> (USSR) and the largest Soviet city. Moscow was one of the primary <!--del_lnk--> military and political objectives for <!--del_lnk--> Axis forces in their <!--del_lnk--> invasion of the Soviet Union.</p>
       <p>The German <!--del_lnk--> strategic offensive named <b>Operation Typhoon</b> was planned to conduct two <!--del_lnk--> pincer offensives, one to the north of Moscow against the <!--del_lnk--> Kalinin Front by the <!--del_lnk--> 3rd and <!--del_lnk--> 4th Panzer Armies, simultaneously severing the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow&ndash;Leningrad railway, and another to the south of <!--del_lnk--> Moscow Oblast against the <!--del_lnk--> Western Front, south of <!--del_lnk--> Tula by the <!--del_lnk--> 2nd Panzer Army, while the 4th Army advanced directly towards Moscow from the west. A separate operational German plan, codenamed <i><!--del_lnk--> Operation Wotan</i>, was included in the final phase of the German offensive.</p>
       <p>Initially, the Soviet forces conducted a <!--del_lnk--> strategic defence of the Moscow Oblast by constructing three <!--del_lnk--> defensive belts, and deploying newly raised <!--del_lnk--> reserve armies as well as bringing troops from the <!--del_lnk--> Siberian and <!--del_lnk--> Far Eastern Military Districts. Subsequently, as the German offensives were halted, a Soviet strategic <!--del_lnk--> counter-offensive and smaller-scale offensive operations were executed to force German armies back to the positions around the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Oryol, <!--del_lnk--> Vyazma and <!--del_lnk--> Vitebsk, nearly surrounding three German armies in the process.</p>

         </div>

       </div>
       <p>The original German invasion plan, which the Axis called <!--del_lnk--> Operation <i>Barbarossa</i>, called for the capture of Moscow within four months.</p>
       <p>On 22 June 1941, German, Romanian and Slovak troops invaded the Soviet Union, later also joined by Hungary (following the <!--del_lnk--> bombing of the Hungarian city Kassa), effectively starting Operation <i>Barbarossa</i>. Having destroyed most of the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Air Force on the ground, German forces quickly advanced deep into Soviet territory using <i><a href="../../wp/b/Blitzkrieg.htm" title="Blitzkrieg">blitzkrieg</a></i> tactics. Armored units raced forward in <!--del_lnk--> pincer movements, <!--del_lnk--> pocketing and destroying entire Soviet armies. While the German <!--del_lnk--> Army Group North moved towards Leningrad, <!--del_lnk--> Army Group South was to take control of <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, while <!--del_lnk--> Army Group Centre advanced towards Moscow. The Soviet defenses were overwhelmed and the casualties sustained by the <!--del_lnk--> Red Army were enormous.</p>
       <p>By July 1941, Army Group Centre had managed to encircle several Soviet armies near <a href="../../wp/m/Minsk.htm" title="Minsk">Minsk</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Bia&#x142;ystok-Minsk, creating a huge breach in Soviet lines&mdash;one that the Soviets could not immediately fill, as no reserves were available&mdash;and destroying the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Western Front as an organized force. Thus, the <i>Wehrmacht</i> was able to cross the <!--del_lnk--> Dnieper river, which barred the path to Moscow, with only minimal casualties.</p>
       <p>In August 1941, German forces captured the city of Smolensk, an important stronghold on the road to Moscow. Smolensk was historically considered the key to Moscow because it controlled a landbridge located between the <!--del_lnk--> Dvina, Dnieper, and several other rivers, allowing for a fast advance by ground troops without the necessity of building major bridges across wide rivers. The desperate Soviet defense of the Smolensk region lasted for two months, from 10 July-10 September 1941. This intense engagement, known as the Battle of Smolensk, delayed the German advance until mid-September, effectively disrupting the <i>blitzkrieg</i> and forcing Army Group Centre to use almost half of its strategic reserves (10 of 24 divisions) during the battle. At this stage, Moscow was vulnerable, but Hitler ordered the attack to turn north and south and eliminate Russian forces at Leningrad and Kiev (whereas the former has to be termed a German failure, the latter resulted in a huge triumph for the Germans). Diversion of the significant part of three (out of four) panzer armies, along with the 2nd, 4th and 9th infantry armies, significantly delayed the German advance on Moscow and caused a major crisis in German leadership. By the time the German advance on Moscow was resumed on 2 October 1941 the troops had significantly weakened and this had a significant impact of <i>Typhoon's</i> outcome.</p>
       <p>Elsewhere, the German advance was also bogged down. Near <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Leningrad">Leningrad</a>, Army Group North was held up by the <!--del_lnk--> Luga defense line for almost a month before eventually overrunning it. In the south, Army Group South&mdash;which included many Hungarian and Romanian units that were less well-trained, equipped and experienced than the <i>Wehrmacht</i>&mdash;faced several serious counterattacks and was stopped. The <i>Wehrmacht</i> now faced a dilemma; Army Group Centre was still strong enough to reach Moscow, but such an advance would create a bulge in the German lines, leaving it vulnerable to Red Army flanking attacks. Moreover, according to Hitler, Germany needed the food and mineral resources located in Ukraine. Thus, the <i>Wehrmacht</i> was ordered to first secure the <!--del_lnk--> Donbass region and to move towards Moscow afterwards. <!--del_lnk--> Heinz Guderian's <i>Panzer</i> Army was turned south to support <!--del_lnk--> Gerd von Rundstedt's attack on Kiev, which inflicted another significant defeat on the Red Army. On 19 September 1941, Soviet forces had to abandon Kiev after Stalin's persistent refusal to withdraw forces from the Kiev salient, as recorded by <a href="../../wp/a/Aleksandr_Vasilevsky.htm" title="Aleksandr Vasilevsky">Aleksandr Vasilevsky</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Georgy Zhukov in their respective memoirs. This refusal cost Zhukov his post of Chief of the General Staff, but his prediction of German encirclement was correct. Several Soviet armies were encircled and annihilated by the <i>Wehrmacht</i> in a double pincer movement, allowing the German forces to advance in the south.</p>
       <p>Although a decisive Axis victory, the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Kiev set the German <i>blitzkrieg</i> even further behind schedule. As Guderian later wrote, "Kiev was certainly a brilliant tactical success, but the question of whether it had a significant strategic importance still remains open. Everything now depended on our ability to achieve expected results before the winter and even before autumn rains." Hitler still believed that the <i>Wehrmacht</i> had a chance to finish the war before winter by taking Moscow. On 2 October 1941, Army Group Centre&mdash;under <!--del_lnk--> Fedor von Bock&mdash;launched its final offensive towards Moscow, code-named Operation <i>Typhoon</i>. Hitler said soon after its start that "After three months of preparations, we finally have the possibility to crush our enemy before the winter comes. All possible preparations were done...; today starts the last battle of the year..."</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Initial_German_advance_.2830_September_.E2.80.93_10_October.29">Initial German advance (30 September &ndash; 10 October)</span></h2>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plans">Plans</span></h3>
       <p>For Hitler, Moscow was the most important military and political target, as he anticipated that the city's surrender would shortly afterwards lead to the general collapse of the Soviet Union. As <!--del_lnk--> Franz Halder, head of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Oberkommando des Heeres</i> (Army General Staff), wrote in 1940, "The best solution would be a direct offensive towards Moscow." Therefore, the city was a primary target for the large and well-equipped Army Group Centre. The forces committed to Operation <i>Typhoon</i> included three armies (the 2nd, 4th and 9th) supported by three <i>Panzer</i> Groups (the 2nd, 3rd and 4th) and by the <a href="../../wp/l/Luftwaffe.htm" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s <!--del_lnk--> <i>Luftflotte</i> 2. Overall, more than one million men were committed to the operation, along with 1,700 tanks and 14,000 guns. German aerial strength had been radically reduced. Since 22 June, the <i>Luftwaffe</i> had lost 1,603 aircraft and 1,028 damaged. As a result, <i>Luftflotte</i> 2 had only 549 serviceable machines, including 158 medium and dive-bombers and 172 fighters. The attack relied on standard <i><a href="../../wp/b/Blitzkrieg.htm" title="Blitzkrieg">blitzkrieg</a></i> tactics, using <i>Panzer</i> groups rushing deep into Soviet formations and executing double-pincer movements, pocketing Red Army divisions and destroying them.</p>
       <p>The initial <i>Wehrmacht</i> plan called for two initial movements. The first would be a double-pincer performed around the Soviet Western and <!--del_lnk--> Reserve Fronts located around <!--del_lnk--> Vyazma. The second would be a single-pincer around the <!--del_lnk--> Bryansk Front to capture the city of <!--del_lnk--> Bryansk. From that point, the plan called for another quick pincer north and south of Moscow to encircle the city. However, the German armies were already battered and experiencing some logistical issues. Guderian, for example, wrote that some of his destroyed tanks had not been replaced, and that his mechanized troops lacked fuel at the beginning of the operation.</p>
       <p>Facing the <i>Wehrmacht</i> were three Soviet fronts formed from exhausted armies that had already been involved in heavy fighting for several months. The forces committed to the city's defense totaled 1,250,000 men, 1,000 tanks, 7,600 guns. The <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Air Force/<i>Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily</i> (VVS) had suffered appalling losses of some 7,500 or 21,200 aircraft. Extraordinary industrial achievements had begun to replace losses, and the VVS had 936 aircraft, 578 of which were bombers for the defense of the capital. Even with reinforcements, air strength was down to about &frac14; of pre-war strength. Troops and weaponry, while presenting a significant threat to the <i>Wehrmacht</i> based on their numbers alone, were poorly located, with most of the troops deployed in a single line, and had little or no reserves to the rear. In his memoirs, Vasilevsky pointed out that while immediate Soviet defenses were quite well prepared, these errors in troop placement were largely responsible for the <i>Wehrmacht's</i> initial success. Furthermore, many Soviet defenders were seriously lacking in combat experience and some critical equipment (such as anti-tank weapons), while their tanks were obsolete models.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The Soviet command began constructing extensive defenses around the city. The first part, the Rzhev-Vyazma defense setup, was built on the <!--del_lnk--> Rzhev&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> Vyazma&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> Bryansk line. The second, the Mozhaisk defense line, was a double defense stretching between <!--del_lnk--> Kalinin and <!--del_lnk--> Kaluga. Finally, a triple defense ring surrounded the city itself, forming the Moscow Defense Zone. These defenses were still largely unprepared by the beginning of the operation because of the speed of the German advance. Furthermore, the German attack plan had been discovered quite late, and Soviet troops were ordered to assume a total defensive stance only on 27 September 1941. However, new Soviet divisions were being formed on the Volga, in Asia and in the <!--del_lnk--> Urals, and it would only be a matter of a few months before these new troops could be committed, making the battle a race against time as well.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Vyazma_and_Bryansk_pockets">Vyazma and Bryansk pockets</span></h3>
       <p>Near Vyazma, the Western and Reserve Fronts were quickly defeated by the highly mobile forces of the 3rd and 4th Panzer Groups that exploited weak areas in the defenses and then quickly moved behind the Red Army lines. The defensive setup, which was still under construction, was overrun as both German armored spearheads met at Vyazma on 10 October 1941. Four Soviet armies (the <!--del_lnk--> 19th, <!--del_lnk--> 20th, <!--del_lnk--> 24th and <!--del_lnk--> 32nd) were trapped in a huge pocket just west of the city.</p>
       <p>Contrary to German expectations, the encircled Soviet forces did not surrender easily. Instead, the fighting was fierce and desperate, and the <i>Wehrmacht</i> had to employ 28 divisions to eliminate the surrounded Soviet armies, using forces that were needed to support the offensive towards Moscow. The remnants of the Soviet <!--del_lnk--> Western and <!--del_lnk--> Reserve Fronts were able to retreat and consolidate their lines around Mozhaisk. Moreover, the surrounded Soviet forces were not completely destroyed, as some of the encircled troops escaped in groups ranging in size from platoons to full rifle divisions. Soviet resistance near Vyazma also provided time for the Soviet high command to quickly bring some reinforcements to the four armies defending the Moscow direction (namely, the 5th, 16th, 43rd and 49th), and to transport three rifle and two tank divisions from the Far East.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In the south near Bryansk, initial Soviet performance was barely more effective than near Vyazma. The Second Panzer Group executed an enveloping movement around the whole front, linking with the advancing 2nd Army and capturing Orel by 3 October and Bryansk by 6 October. <i>Luftflotte</i> 2 flew 984 combat missions and destroyed some 679 vehicles on 3 October. On 4 October, a mixture of 100 dive bombers and medium bombers destroyed rail lines and hampered Soviet troop movements in the Sumy-Lgov-Kursk area, severing communications between the Bryansk and South-Western Fronts. The Soviet <!--del_lnk--> 3rd and <!--del_lnk--> 13th Armies were encircled but, again, did not surrender, and troops were able to escape in small groups, retreating to intermediate defense lines around Poniry and <!--del_lnk--> Mtsensk. By 23 October, the last remnants had escaped from the pocket.</p>
       <p>By 7 October, the German offensive in this area was bogged down. The first snow fell and quickly melted, turning roads into stretches of mud, a phenomenon known as <i><!--del_lnk--> rasputitsa</i> in Russia. German armored groups were greatly slowed and were unable to easily maneuver, wearing down men and tanks. The 4th Panzer Division fell into an ambush set by <!--del_lnk--> Dmitri Leliushenko's hastily formed <!--del_lnk--> 1st Guards Special Rifle Corps, including <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Katukov's 4th Tank Brigade, near the city of <!--del_lnk--> Mtsensk. Newly built <a href="../../wp/t/T-34.htm" title="T-34">T-34</a> tanks were concealed in the woods as German armor rolled past them; as a <!--del_lnk--> scratch team of Soviet infantry contained their advance, Soviet armor attacked from both flanks and savaged the German <!--del_lnk--> Panzer IV tanks. For the <i>Wehrmacht</i>, the shock of this defeat was so great that a special investigation was ordered. Guderian and his troops discovered, to their dismay, that new Soviet T-34s were almost impervious to German tank guns. As the general wrote, "Our <!--del_lnk--> Panzer IV tanks with their short 75&nbsp;mm guns could only explode a T-34 by hitting the engine from behind." Guderian also noted in his memoirs that "the Russians already learned a few things." <i>Luftflotte</i> 2 flew 1,400 attacks against Soviet positions to support the 4th <i>Panzerdivision</i>, destroying 20 tanks, 34 artillery pieces and 650 vehicles of various kinds.</p>
       <p>Elsewhere, massive Soviet counterattacks had further slowed the German offensive. The 2nd Army which was operating to the north of Guderian's forces with the aim of trapping the Bryansk Front, had come under a strong Soviet counter-attack. The Soviets supported the assault with heavy air-support. Despite being numerically inferior, the <i>Luftwaffe</i> inflicted heavy losses to the VVS. 152 <i>Stuka</i> sorties and 259 medium bombers blunted the Soviet attack while another 202 Stuka and 188 medium bomber strikes were flown against supply columns in the Brynask area. Soviet Forces were caught in the open, with the <i>Luftwaffe</i> destroying 22 tanks and over 450 vehicles; the Soviet attack had been routed.</p>
       <p>The magnitude of the initial Soviet defeat was appalling. According to German estimates, 673,000 soldiers were captured by the <i>Wehrmacht</i> in both pockets, although recent research suggests a significantly lower&mdash;but still enormous&mdash;figure of 514,000 prisoners, reducing Soviet strength by 41%. The personnel losses (permanent as well as temporary) calculated by the Soviet command are smaller but still massive, namely 499,001. On 9 October <!--del_lnk--> Otto Dietrich of the <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of Propaganda, quoting Hitler himself, forecast in a press conference imminent destruction of the armies defending Moscow. As Hitler had never had to lie about a specific and verifiable military fact, Dietrich convinced foreign correspondents that the collapse of all Soviet resistance was perhaps hours away. German civilian morale&mdash;low since the start of Barbarossa&mdash;significantly improved, with rumors of soldiers home by Christmas and great riches from the future <!--del_lnk--> Lebensraum in the east.</p>
       <p>The desperate Red Army resistance, however, had greatly slowed the <i>Wehrmacht</i>. When, on 10 October 1941, the Germans arrived within sight of the Mozhaisk line, they found a well-prepared defensive setup and new, fresh Soviet forces. That same day, <!--del_lnk--> Georgy Zhukov was recalled from Leningrad to take charge of the defense of Moscow. He immediately ordered the concentration of all available defenses on a strengthened Mozhaisk line, a move supported by Vasilevsky. The <i>Luftwaffe</i> still controlled the sky whenever it appeared in strength. The <i>Stukageschwader</i> and <i>Kampfgruppen</i> (<i>Stuka</i> and bomber groups) flew 537 sorties destroying some 440 vehicles (mainly motor vehicles and trucks) and 150 artillery pieces.</p>
       <p>On 15 October, Stalin ordered the evacuation of the Communist Party, the General Staff and various civil government offices from Moscow to Kuibyshev (now <!--del_lnk--> Samara), leaving only a limited number of officials behind. The evacuation caused panic among Muscovites. On 16&ndash;17 October, much of the civilian population tried to flee, mobbing the available trains and jamming the roads from the city. Despite all this, Stalin publicly remained in the Soviet capital, somewhat calming the fear and pandemonium.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mozhaisk_defense_line_.2813_October_.E2.80.93_30_October.29">Mozhaisk defense line (13 October &ndash; 30 October)</span></h2>
       <p>By 13 October 1941, the <i>Wehrmacht</i> had arrived at the Mozhaisk defense line, a hastily constructed double set of fortifications protecting Moscow from the west and stretching from <!--del_lnk--> Kalinin towards <!--del_lnk--> Volokolamsk and Kaluga. However, despite recent reinforcements, the combined strength of the Soviet armies manning the line (the <!--del_lnk--> 5th, <!--del_lnk--> 16th, 43rd and 49th Armies) barely reached 90,000 men, hardly sufficient to stem the German advance. In light of the situation, Zhukov decided to concentrate his forces at four critical points: <!--del_lnk--> Volokolamsk, <!--del_lnk--> Mozhaisk, <!--del_lnk--> Maloyaroslavets and <!--del_lnk--> Kaluga. The entire <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Western Front&mdash;almost completely destroyed after its encirclement near Vyazma&mdash;was being recreated from scratch.</p>
       <p>Moscow itself was transformed into a fortress. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and teenagers worked, building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million cubic meters of earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily transformed into military complexes: the automobile factory was turned into a <!--del_lnk--> submachine gun armory, a clock factory was manufacturing <!--del_lnk--> mine detonators, the chocolate factory was producing food for the front, and automobile repair stations were repairing damaged tanks and vehicles. However, the situation was very dangerous, as the Soviet capital was still within reach of German <i>panzers</i>. Additionally, Moscow was now a target of massive air raids, although these caused only limited damage because of extensive <!--del_lnk--> anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.</p>
       <p>On 13 October 1941 (15 October 1941, according to other sources), the <i>Wehrmacht</i> resumed its offensive. At first, the Germans were unwilling to assault the Soviet defenses directly and attempted to bypass them by pushing northeast towards the weakly protected city of Kalinin, and south towards Kaluga and Tula, capturing all except Tula by 14 October. Encouraged by this initial success, the Germans conducted a frontal assault against the fortified line, taking Mozhaisk and <!--del_lnk--> Maloyaroslavets on 18 October, <!--del_lnk--> Naro-Fominsk on 21 October, and <!--del_lnk--> Volokolamsk on 27 October, after intense fighting. Because of the increasing danger of flanking attacks, Zhukov was forced to fall back and withdraw his forces east of the <!--del_lnk--> Nara River.</p>
       <p>In the south, the Second Panzer Army was moving towards Tula with relative ease, since the Mozhaisk defense line did not extend that far south, and because there were no significant concentrations of Soviet troops to slow down the advance. However, the bad weather, fuel problems, and damaged roads and bridges greatly slowed the Germans; Guderian reached the outskirts of Tula only by 26 October 1941. The German plan initially called for an instant capture of Tula and for a pincer move around Moscow. However, the first attempt to capture the city failed, as German <i>panzers</i> were stopped by the 50th Army and civilian volunteers in a desperate fight. Guderian's army had to stop within sight of the city on 29 October 1941. On 31 October, the <i>OKH</i> ordered a halt to all offensive operations until the heavy logistical issues and the <i><!--del_lnk--> rasputitsa</i> subsided.</p>

       <p>As <!--del_lnk--> David Glantz pointed out in his book <i>When Titans Clashed</i>, by late October the <i>Wehrmacht</i> and the Red Army could be compared to "punch-drunk boxers, staying precariously on their feet but rapidly losing the power to hurt each other." The German forces were worn out, with only &#x2153; of their motor vehicles still functioning, infantry divisions at &#x2153; to &frac12; strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender to the idea of a long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly <!--del_lnk--> capture of Warsaw in 1939.</p>
       <p>In his study of the Nazi economy, <!--del_lnk--> Adam Tooze contends that the very survival of the Red Army as a fighting force indicated that the Germans had lost the conflict in Russia, and thus the war, as moving east of Smolensk meant stretching German supply lines beyond their effective limit. He highlights that the colossal loss of material on the eastern front &ndash; without having won a decisive victory &ndash; was bleeding the German economy to death &ndash; reaching "a total impasse". He concludes "It was through the achievement of <i><!--del_lnk--> Lebensraum</i> on American scale that the Third <i>Reich</i> hoped to achieve both the standard of affluence and the encompassing reach of global power already attained by Britain and the United States. As events between June and December 1941 made clear, Nazi Germany lacked both the time and the resources to take this first step."</p>

       <p>Both to stiffen the resolve of the Red Army and to boost the civilian morale, Stalin ordered a traditional military parade on 7 November to be staged in <!--del_lnk--> Red Square. Soviet troops paraded past the Kremlin and then marched directly to the front. The parade had a great symbolic significance in demonstrating the Soviet resolve and was invoked as such frequently in the years to come. However, despite such a brave show, the Red Army was actually in a very precarious position. Although 100,000 additional Soviet troops had reinforced <!--del_lnk--> Klin and <!--del_lnk--> Tula, where new German offensives were expected, Soviet defenses were still relatively thin. Nevertheless, Stalin wanted several preemptive counteroffensives to be launched against the German lines, despite protests from Zhukov, who pointed out the complete lack of reserves. The Wehrmacht was able to repel most of these counteroffensives, depleting the Red Army of men and vehicles that could have been used for Moscow's defense. The offensive was only successful west of Moscow near <!--del_lnk--> Aleksino, where Soviet tanks inflicted heavy losses on the 4th Army because the Germans still lacked anti-tank weapons capable of damaging the new, well-armored T-34 tanks.</p>
       <p>From 31 October-15 November, the Wehrmacht high command stood down and prepared the launch for a second offensive towards Moscow. Although Army Group Centre still possessed a considerable amount of troops on paper, its fighting strength had thoroughly diminished, as the troops were worn out and there were only few replacements. The Germans were aware of the continuous influx of Soviet reinforcements from the east, as well as the presence of large reserves in the back, but given the tremendous Soviet casualties they did not expect the Soviets to be able to establish a determined defense. Soviet troops' strength had in fact been reduced to about 500,000 men and 890 tanks at Moscow. However, compared to October, Soviet rifle divisions occupied much better defensive positions, a triple defensive ring surrounding the city, and some remains of the Mozhaisk line still in Soviet hands near Klin. Most of the Soviet field armies now had a multilayered defense with at least two rifle divisions in second echelon positions. Artillery support and <!--del_lnk--> sapper teams were also concentrated along major roads that German troops were expected to use in their attacks. There were also a large number of Soviet troops still in reserve armies behind the front available. Finally, Soviet troops&mdash;and especially officers&mdash;were now more experienced and better prepared for the offensive.</p>

       <p>By 15 November 1941, the ground had finally frozen, solving the mud problem. The armored <i>Wehrmacht</i> spearheads were unleashed, with the goal of encircling Moscow and linking up near the city of <!--del_lnk--> Noginsk, east of the capital. In order to achieve this objective, the German Third and Fourth Panzer Groups needed to concentrate their forces between the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow reservoir and Mozhaysk, then proceed to Klin and <!--del_lnk--> Solnechnogorsk to encircle the capital from the north. In the south, the Second Panzer Army intended to bypass Tula, still in Soviet hands, and advance to <!--del_lnk--> Kashira and <!--del_lnk--> Kolomna, linking up with the northern pincer at Noginsk.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Final_pincer">Final pincer</span></h3>
       <p>On 15 November 1941, German tank armies began their offensive towards <!--del_lnk--> Klin, where no Soviet reserves were available because of Stalin's wish to attempt a counteroffensive at <!--del_lnk--> Volokolamsk, which had forced the relocation of all available reserves forces further south. Initial German attacks split the front in two, separating the 16th Army from the 30th. Several days of intense combat followed. As <!--del_lnk--> Zhukov recalls in his memoirs, "The enemy, ignoring the casualties, was making frontal assaults, willing to get to Moscow by any means necessary." Despite the <i>Wehrmacht</i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s efforts, the multi-layered defense reduced Soviet casualties as the Soviet 16th Army slowly retreated and constantly harassed the German divisions trying to make their way through the fortifications.</p>
       <p>The Third Panzer Army finally captured Klin after heavy fighting on 24 November, and by 25 November Solnechnogorsk as well. Soviet resistance was still strong, and the outcome of the battle was by no means certain. Reportedly, Stalin asked Zhukov whether Moscow could be successfully defended and ordered him to "speak honestly, like a communist." Zhukov replied that it was possible, but that reserves were desperately needed. By 28 November, the German 7th Panzer Division had seized a bridgehead across the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow-Volga Canal&mdash;the last major obstacle before Moscow&mdash;and stood less than 35&nbsp;km (22&nbsp;mi) from the Kremlin; but a powerful counterattack by the <!--del_lnk--> 1st Shock Army drove them back across the canal. Just northwest of Moscow, the <i>Wehrmacht</i> reached <!--del_lnk--> Krasnaya Polyana, little more than 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) from Moscow; German officers were able to make out some of the major buildings of the Soviet capital through their field glasses. However, both Soviet and German forces were severely depleted, sometimes having only 150&ndash;200 riflemen&mdash;a company's full strength&mdash;left in a regiment.</p>
       <p>In the south, near Tula, battle resumed on 18 November 1941, with the Second Panzer Army trying to encircle the city. The German forces involved were extremely battered from previous fighting, and still had no winter clothing. As a result, initial German progress was only 5&ndash;10&nbsp;km (3.1&ndash;6.2&nbsp;mi) per day, making chances of success "less than certain" according to Guderian. Moreover, it exposed the German tank armies to flanking attacks from the Soviet 49th and 50th Armies, located near Tula, further slowing the advance. However, Guderian was still able to pursue the offensive, spreading his forces in a star-like attack, taking <!--del_lnk--> Stalinogorsk on 22 November 1941 and surrounding a Soviet rifle division stationed there. On 26 November, German <i>panzers</i> approached <!--del_lnk--> Kashira, a city controlling a major highway to Moscow. In response, a violent Soviet counterattack was launched the following day. General Belov's 2nd Cavalry Corps, supported by hastily assembled formations which included 173rd Rifle Division, 9th Tank Brigade, two separate tank battalions, and training and militia units, halted the German advance near Kashira. The Germans were driven back in early December, securing the southern approach to the city. Tula itself held, protected by fortifications and determined defenders, both soldiers and civilians. In the south, the <i>Wehrmacht</i> never got close to the capital.</p>

       <p>Because of the resistance on both the northern and southern sides of Moscow, the Wehrmacht attempted, on 1 December 1941, a direct offensive from the west, along the Minsk-Moscow highway near the city of <!--del_lnk--> Naro-Fominsk. However, this offensive had only limited tank support and was forced to assault extensive Soviet defenses. After meeting determined resistance from the Soviet 1st Guards Motorized Rifle Division and flank counterattacks staged by the 33rd Army, the German offensive stalled and was driven back four days later in the ensuing Soviet counteroffensive. On 2 December a Reconnaissance-Battalion managed to reach the town of <!--del_lnk--> Khimki&mdash;some 8&nbsp;km (5.0&nbsp;mi) away from Moscow&mdash;and captured its bridge over the Moscow-Volga Canal as well as its railway station, which marked the farthest advance of German forces on Moscow.</p>
       <p>The weather dropped to well below freezing. On 30 November, von Bock reported to Berlin that the temperature was &ndash;45 &deg;C (&ndash;49 &deg;F). General <!--del_lnk--> Erhard Raus, commander of the <!--del_lnk--> 6th Panzer Division, kept track of the daily mean temperature in his war diary. It shows a suddenly much colder period during 4&ndash;7 December: from &ndash;36 to &ndash;38 &deg;C (&ndash;32 to &ndash;36 &deg;F). Other temperature reports varied widely. Zhukov said that November's freezing weather stayed around &ndash;7 to &ndash;10 &deg;C (+19 to +14 &deg;F) Official Soviet Meteorological Service records show the lowest December temperature reached &ndash;28.8 &deg;C (&ndash;20 &deg;F). The absolute numbers did not matter to the German troops who were freezing with no winter clothing, and whose equipment was not designed for such severe weather. More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. Frozen grease had to be removed from every loaded shell and vehicles had to be heated for hours before use. The same cold weather, typical for the season, hit the Soviet troops, but they were better prepared.</p>
       <p>The Axis offensive on Moscow stopped. As <!--del_lnk--> Heinz Guderian wrote in his journal, "the offensive on Moscow failed...We underestimated the enemy's strength, as well as his size and climate. Fortunately, I stopped my troops on 5 December, otherwise the catastrophe would be unavoidable."</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Although the <i>Wehrmacht</i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s offensive had been stopped, German intelligence estimated that Soviet forces had no more reserves left and thus would be unable to stage a counteroffensive. This estimate proved wrong, as Stalin transferred over 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East, relying on intelligence from his spy, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Sorge, which indicated that Japan would not attack the Soviet Union. The Red Army had accumulated a 58-division reserve by early December, when the offensive proposed by Zhukov and Vasilevsky was finally approved by Stalin. However, even with these new reserves, Soviet forces committed to the operation numbered only 1,100,000 men, only slightly outnumbering the <i>Wehrmacht</i>. Nevertheless, with careful troop deployment, a ratio of two-to-one was reached at some critical points. On 5 December 1941, the counteroffensive started on the Kalinin Front. After two days of little progress, Soviet armies retook Krasnaya Polyana and several other cities in the immediate vicinity of Moscow.</p>
       <p>The same day, Hitler signed his directive number 39, ordering the <i>Wehrmacht</i> to assume a defensive stance on the whole front. However, German troops were unable to organize a solid defense at their present locations and were forced to pull back to consolidate their lines. Guderian wrote that discussions with <!--del_lnk--> Hans Schmidt and <!--del_lnk--> Wolfram von Richthofen took place the same day, and both commanders agreed that the current front line could not be held. On 14 December, <!--del_lnk--> Franz Halder and <!--del_lnk--> G&uuml;nther von Kluge finally gave permission for a limited withdrawal to the west of the <!--del_lnk--> Oka river, without Hitler's approval. On 20 December, during a meeting with German senior officers, Hitler cancelled the withdrawal and ordered his soldiers to defend every patch of ground, "digging trenches with howitzer shells if needed." Guderian protested, pointing out that losses from cold were actually greater than combat losses and that winter equipment was held by traffic ties in Poland. (The Soviets were also suffering large losses from the freezing cold but nevertheless had better equipment for the cold than the Germans.) Nevertheless, Hitler insisted on defending the existing lines, and Guderian was dismissed by Christmas, along with generals Hoepner and Strauss, commanders of the 4th Panzer and 9th Army, respectively. <!--del_lnk--> Fedor von Bock was also dismissed, officially for "medical reasons." <!--del_lnk--> Walther von Brauchitsch, Hitler's commander-in-chief, had been removed even earlier, on 19 December.</p>
       <p>Meanwhile, the Soviet offensive continued in the north. The offensive liberated Kalinin and the Soviets reached Klin on 7 December, overrunning the headquarters of the LVI <i>Panzer</i> Corps outside the city. As the Kalinin Front drove west, a bulge developed around Klin. The Soviet front commander, General <!--del_lnk--> Konev, attempted to envelop any German forces remaining. Zhukov diverted more forces to the southern end of the bulge, to help Konev trap the <!--del_lnk--> Third Panzer Army. The Germans pulled their forces out in time. Although the encirclement failed, it unhinged the German defenses. A second attempt was made against the <!--del_lnk--> Second Panzer Army near Tula, but met strong opposition near Rzhev and was forced to halt, forming a salient that would last until 1943. In the south, the offensive went equally well, with Southwestern Front forces relieving <!--del_lnk--> Tula on 16 December 1941. A major achievement was the encirclement and destruction of the German XXXIX Corps, protecting Guderian's Second Panzer Army's southern flank.</p>
       <p>The <i>Luftwaffe</i> was paralysed in the second half of December. The weather, recorded as &minus;42 &deg;C (&ndash;44 &deg;F), was a meteorological record. Logistical difficulties and freezing temperatures created technical difficulties until January 1942. In the meantime, the <i>Luftwaffe</i> had virtually vanished from the skies over Moscow, while the <!--del_lnk--> Red Air Force, operating from better prepared bases and benefiting from interior lines, grew stronger. On 4 January, the skies cleared. The <i>Luftwaffe</i> was quickly reinforced, as Hitler hoped it would "save" the situation. Two <i>Kampfgruppen</i> (Bomber Groups) (II./<!--del_lnk--> KG 4 and II./<!--del_lnk--> KG 30) arrived from refitting in Germany, whilst four <i>Transportgruppen</i> (Transport Groups) with a strength of 102 <!--del_lnk--> Junkers Ju 52 transports were deployed from <i><!--del_lnk--> Luftflotte 4</i> (Air Fleet 4) to evacuate surrounded army units and improve the supply line to the front-line forces. It was a last minute effort and it worked. The German air arm was to help prevent a total collapse of Army Group Centre. Despite the Soviets' best efforts, the <i>Luftwaffe</i> had contributed enormously to the survival of Army Group Centre. Between the 17 December and 22 December the <i>Luftwaffe</i> destroyed 299 motor vehicles and 23 tanks around Tula, hampering the Red Army's pursuit of the German Army.</p>
       <p>In the center, Soviet progress was much slower. Soviet troops liberated Naro-Fominsk only on 26 December, Kaluga on 28 December, and Maloyaroslavets on 2 January, after 10 days of violent action. Soviet reserves ran low, and the offensive halted on 7 January 1942, after having pushed the exhausted and freezing German armies back 100&ndash;250&nbsp;km (62&ndash;160&nbsp;mi) from Moscow. Stalin continued to order more offensives in order to trap and destroy Army Group Centre in front of Moscow, but the Red Army was exhausted and overstretched and they failed. This victory provided an important boost for Soviet morale, with the <i>Wehrmacht</i> suffering its first defeat. Having failed to vanquish the Soviet Union in one quick strike, Germany now had to prepare for a prolonged struggle. <!--del_lnk--> Operation Barbarossa had failed.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The Red Army's winter counter-offensive drove the Wehrmacht from Moscow, but the city was still considered to be threatened, with the front line still relatively close. Because of this, the Moscow theatre remained a priority for Stalin, who at first appeared to be in shock due to the initial German success. In particular, the initial Soviet advance was unable to level the <!--del_lnk--> Rzhev salient, held by several divisions of Army Group Centre. Immediately after the Moscow counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the <!--del_lnk--> Battles of Rzhev) were attempted against the salient, each time with heavy losses on both sides. Soviet losses are estimated to be between 500,000 and 1,000,000 men, and German losses between 300,000 and 450,000 men. By early 1943, however, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from the salient as the whole front was moving west. Nevertheless, the Moscow front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Centre was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper <!--del_lnk--> Dnieper at the end of the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Smolensk_%25281943%2529.htm" title="Battle of Smolensk (1943)">Second Battle of Smolensk</a>.</p>
       <p>Furious that his army had been unable to take Moscow, Hitler dismissed his commander-in-chief, <!--del_lnk--> Walther von Brauchitsch, on 19 December 1941, and took personal charge of the <i>Wehrmacht</i>, effectively taking control of all military decisions and setting most experienced German officers against him. Additionally, Hitler surrounded himself with staff officers with little or no recent combat experience. As Guderian wrote in his memoirs, "This created a cold (chill) in our relations, a cold (chill) that could never be eliminated afterwards." This increased Hitler's distrust of his senior officers and severely reduced the German advantages due to their superior military <!--del_lnk--> leadership. Germany now faced the prospect of a <!--del_lnk--> war of attrition, something it was not prepared for and bound to lose in the long run. Overall, the battle was a stinging defeat for the Axis, though not necessarily a crushing one, and it ended German hopes for a quick and decisive victory over the Soviet Union.</p>
       <p>For the first time since June 1941, Soviet forces had stopped the Germans and driven them back. This resulted in Stalin becoming overconfident and deciding to further expand the offensive. On 5 January 1942, during a meeting in the Kremlin, Stalin announced that he was planning a general spring counteroffensive, which would be staged simultaneously near Moscow, Leningrad and in southern Russia. This plan was accepted over Zhukov's objections. However, low Red Army reserves and Wehrmacht tactical skill led to a bloody stalemate near Rzhev, known as the "<!--del_lnk--> Rzhev meat grinder", and to a string of Red Army defeats, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Second Battle of Kharkov, the failed attempt at elimination of the <!--del_lnk--> Demyansk pocket, and the encirclement of General <!--del_lnk--> Vlasov's army near Leningrad in a failed attempt to lift the <!--del_lnk--> siege of the city. Ultimately, these failures would lead to a successful German offensive in the south and to the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Stalingrad.htm" title="Battle of Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a>.</p>
       <p>Nevertheless, the defense of Moscow became a symbol of Soviet resistance against the invading Axis forces. To commemorate the battle, Moscow was awarded the title of "<!--del_lnk--> Hero City" in 1965, on the 20th anniversary of <!--del_lnk--> Victory Day. A Museum of the Defence of Moscow was created in 1995</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Casualties">Casualties</span></h2>
       <p>Both German and Soviet casualties during the battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Not all historians agree on what should be considered the "Battle of Moscow" in the timeline of World War II. While the start of the battle is usually regarded as the beginning of Operation <i>Typhoon</i> on 30 September 1941 (or sometimes on 2 October 1941), there are two different dates for the end of the offensive. In particular, some sources (such as Erickson and Glantz) exclude the Rzhev offensive from the scope of the battle, considering it as a distinct operation and making the Moscow offensive "stop" on 7 January 1942&mdash;thus lowering the number of casualties. Other historians, who include the Rzhev and Vyazma operations in the scope of the battle (thus making the battle end in May 1942), give higher casualty numbers.</p>
       <p>There are also significant differences in figures from various sources. John Erickson, in his <i>Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies</i>, gives a figure of 653,924 Soviet casualties between October 1941 and January 1942. Glantz, in his book <i>When Titans Clashed</i>, gives a figure of 658,279 for the defense phase alone, plus 370,955 for the winter counteroffensive until 7 January 1942. The <i>Great Soviet Encyclopedia</i>, published in 1973&ndash;1978, estimates 400,000 German casualties by January 1942. Another estimate available is provided in the <i>Moscow Encyclopedia</i>, published in 1997; its authors, based on various sources, give a figure of 145,000 German and 900,000 Soviet casualties for the defensive phase, along with 103,000 German and 380,000 Soviet casualties for the counteroffensive until 7 January 1942. Many of the Soviet casualties, however, consisted of captured men. On the other hand, Wehrmacht daily casualty reports show 35,757 killed in action, 128,716 wounded, and 9,721 missing in action for the entire Army Group Centre between 1 October 1941 and 10 January 1942. Therefore, total casualties between 30 September 1941, and 7 January 1942, are estimated to be between 174,000 and 400,000 for the <i>Wehrmacht</i> (GSE / Moscow encyclopedia estimate) and between 650,000 and 1,280,000 for the Red Army (Erickson / Moscow encyclopedia estimate).</p>
       <p>Regardless of these disagreements, the Battle of Moscow is considered among the <!--del_lnk--> most lethal battles in world history.</p>
