       <p>A <b>bridge</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> structure built to <!--del_lnk--> span physical obstacles such as a <!--del_lnk--> body of water, <!--del_lnk--> valley, or <!--del_lnk--> road, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle. There are many different designs that all serve unique purposes and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed, the material used to make it and the funds available to build it.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Oxford English Dictionary traces the origin of the word <i>bridge</i> to an Old English word <i>brycg</i>, of the same meaning, derived from the hypothetical <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Germanic root <i>brugj&#x14D;</i>. There are <!--del_lnk--> cognates in other Germanic languages.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>The first bridges were made by nature itself &mdash; as simple as a log fallen across a <!--del_lnk--> stream or stones in the <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">river</a>. The first bridges made by humans were probably spans of cut wooden logs or planks and eventually stones, using a simple support and crossbeam arrangement. Some early Americans used trees or bamboo poles to cross small caverns or wells to get from one place to another. A common form of lashing sticks, logs, and deciduous branches together involved the use of long reeds or other harvested fibers woven together to form a connective rope capable of binding and holding together the materials used in early bridges.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Arkadiko Bridge is one of four <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean <!--del_lnk--> corbel arch bridges part of a former network of roads, designed to accommodate chariots, between <!--del_lnk--> Tiryns to <!--del_lnk--> Epidauros in the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnese, in <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>. Dating to the Greek <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> (13th century BC), it is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use. Several intact arched stone bridges from the <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic era can be found in the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnese in southern <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a></p>
       <p>The greatest bridge builders of antiquity were the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Romans. The Romans built <!--del_lnk--> arch bridges and <!--del_lnk--> aqueducts that could stand in conditions that would damage or destroy earlier designs. Some stand today. An example is the <!--del_lnk--> Alc&aacute;ntara Bridge, built over the river <!--del_lnk--> Tagus, in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>. The Romans also used <!--del_lnk--> cement, which reduced the variation of strength found in natural stone. One type of cement, called <!--del_lnk--> pozzolana, consisted of water, lime, sand, and <!--del_lnk--> volcanic rock. <!--del_lnk--> Brick and <!--del_lnk--> mortar bridges were built after the Roman era, as the technology for cement was lost then later rediscovered.</p>
       <p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Arthashastra</i> of <!--del_lnk--> Kautilya mentions the construction of dams and bridges. A <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan bridge near <!--del_lnk--> Girnar was surveyed by <!--del_lnk--> James Princep. The bridge was swept away during a flood, and later repaired by Puspagupta, the chief architect of emperor <!--del_lnk--> Chandragupta I. The bridge also fell under the care of the <!--del_lnk--> Yavana Tushaspa, and the <!--del_lnk--> Satrap Rudra Daman. The use of stronger bridges using plaited bamboo and iron chain was visible in India by about the 4th century. A number of bridges, both for military and commercial purposes, were constructed by the <a href="../../wp/m/Mughal_Empire.htm" title="Mughal Empire">Mughal</a> administration in India.</p>
       <p>Although large Chinese bridges of wooden construction existed at the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Warring States, the oldest surviving stone bridge in China is the <!--del_lnk--> Zhaozhou Bridge, built from 595 to 605 AD during the <!--del_lnk--> Sui Dynasty. This bridge is also historically significant as it is the world's oldest open-<!--del_lnk--> spandrel stone segmental arch bridge. European segmental arch bridges date back to at least the <!--del_lnk--> Alcon&eacute;tar Bridge (approximately 2nd century AD), while the enormous Roman era <!--del_lnk--> Trajan's Bridge (105 AD) featured open-spandrel segmental arches in wooden construction.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Rope bridges, a simple type of <!--del_lnk--> suspension bridge, were used by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Inca</a> civilization in the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> mountains of South America, just prior to European colonization in the 16th century.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>During the 18th century there were many innovations in the design of timber bridges by <!--del_lnk--> Hans Ulrich, <!--del_lnk--> Johannes Grubenmann, and others. The first book on bridge engineering was written by <!--del_lnk--> Hubert Gautier in 1716. A major breakthrough in bridge technology came with the erection of <a href="../../wp/t/The_Iron_Bridge.htm" title="The Iron Bridge">the Iron Bridge</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Coalbrookdale, England in 1779. It used <!--del_lnk--> cast iron for the first time as arches to cross the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Severn.htm" title="River Severn">river Severn</a>.</p>
       <p>With the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in the 19th century, <!--del_lnk--> truss systems of <!--del_lnk--> wrought iron were developed for larger bridges, but iron did not have the <!--del_lnk--> tensile strength to support large loads. With the advent of steel, which has a high tensile strength, much larger bridges were built, many using the ideas of <!--del_lnk--> Gustave Eiffel.</p>
       <p>In 1927 <a href="../../wp/w/Welding.htm" title="Welding">welding</a> pioneer <!--del_lnk--> Stefan Bry&#x142;a designed the first welded road bridge in the world, which was later built across the river <!--del_lnk--> S&#x142;udwia Maurzyce near <!--del_lnk--> &#x141;owicz, Poland in 1929. In 1995, the <!--del_lnk--> American Welding Society presented the Historic Welded Structure Award for the bridge to Poland.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_bridges">Types of bridges</span></h2>
       <p>Bridges can be categorized in several different ways. Common categories include the type of structural elements used, by what they carry, whether they are fixed or movable, and by the materials used.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Structure_type">Structure type</span></h3>
       <p>Bridges may be classified by how the forces of <!--del_lnk--> tension, <!--del_lnk--> compression, <!--del_lnk--> bending, <!--del_lnk--> torsion and <!--del_lnk--> shear are distributed through their structure. Most bridges will employ all of the principal forces to some degree, but only a few will predominate. The separation of forces may be quite clear. In a suspension or cable-stayed span, the elements in tension are distinct in shape and placement. In other cases the forces may be distributed among a large number of members, as in a truss, or not clearly discernible to a casual observer as in a box beam.</p>

         <td>Beam bridges are horizontal beams supported at each end by substructure units and can be either <i><!--del_lnk--> simply supported</i> when the beams only connect across a single span, or <i>continuous</i> when the beams are connected across two or more spans. When there are multiple spans, the intermediate supports are known as <!--del_lnk--> piers. The earliest beam bridges were simple logs that sat across streams and similar simple structures. In modern times, beam bridges can range from small, wooden beams to large, steel boxes. The vertical force on the bridge becomes a <!--del_lnk--> shear and <!--del_lnk--> flexural load on the beam which is transferred down its length to the substructures on either side They are typically made of steel, concrete or wood. Beam bridge spans rarely exceed 250 feet (76&nbsp;m) long, as the flexural stresses increase proportional to the square of the length (and deflection increases proportional to the 4th power of the length). However, the main span of the <!--del_lnk--> Rio-Niteroi Bridge, a box girder bridge, is 300 metres (980&nbsp;ft). <p>The world's longest beam bridge is <!--del_lnk--> Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in southern <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana in the United States, at 23.83 miles (38.35&nbsp;km), with individual spans of 56 feet (17&nbsp;m). Beam bridges are the most common bridge type in use today.</p>

The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by nineteenth and early twentieth century engineers. A truss bridge is economical to construct owing to its efficient use of materials.</td>

       <p>Most bridges are fixed bridges, meaning they have no moving parts and stay in one place until they fail or are demolished. Temporary bridges, such as <!--del_lnk--> Bailey bridges, are designed to be assembled, and taken apart, transported to a different site, and re-used. They are important in military engineering, and are also used to carry traffic while an old bridge is being rebuilt. <!--del_lnk--> Movable bridges are designed to move out of the way of boats or other kinds of traffic, which would otherwise be too tall to fit. These are generally electrically powered.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Double-decked_bridges">Double-decked bridges</span></h3>
       <p>Double-decked or double-decker bridges have two levels, such as the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco &ndash; Oakland Bay Bridge, with two road levels. <!--del_lnk--> Tsing Ma Bridge and <!--del_lnk--> Kap Shui Mun Bridge in <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> have six lanes on their upper decks, and on their lower decks there are two lanes and a pair of tracks for <!--del_lnk--> MTR metro trains. Some double-decker bridges only use one level for street traffic; the <!--del_lnk--> Washington Avenue Bridge in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Minneapolis.htm" title="Minneapolis, Minnesota">Minneapolis</a> reserves its lower level for automobile traffic and its upper level for pedestrian and bicycle traffic (predominantly students at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Minnesota). Likewise, in <a href="../../wp/t/Toronto.htm" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Prince Edward Viaduct has five lanes of motor traffic, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks on its upper deck; and a pair of tracks for the <!--del_lnk--> Bloor&ndash;Danforth <!--del_lnk--> subway line on its lower deck.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Stephenson.htm" title="Robert Stephenson">Robert Stephenson</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> High Level Bridge across the <!--del_lnk--> River Tyne in <a href="../../wp/n/Newcastle_upon_Tyne.htm" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, completed in 1849, is an early example of a double-deck bridge. The upper level carries a railway, and the lower level is used for road traffic. Other examples include <!--del_lnk--> Britannia Bridge over the <!--del_lnk--> Menai Strait and <!--del_lnk--> Craigavon Bridge in <!--del_lnk--> Derry, <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Oresund Bridge between <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Malm&ouml; consists of a four-lane highway on the upper level and a pair of railway tracks at the lower level. The <!--del_lnk--> George Washington Bridge between New Jersey and New York has two roadway levels. It was built with only the upper roadway as traffic demands did not require more capacity. A <!--del_lnk--> truss work between the roadway levels provides stiffness to the roadways and reduced movement of the upper level when installed. The George Washington bridge is also the most used bridge in the world. <a href="../../wp/t/Tower_Bridge.htm" title="Tower Bridge">Tower Bridge</a> is different example of a double-decker bridge, with the central section consisting of a low level <!--del_lnk--> bascule span and a high level <!--del_lnk--> footbridge.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Viaducts">Viaducts</span></h3>
       <p>A viaduct is made up of multiple bridges connected into one longer structure. The longest and some of the highest bridges are viaducts, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Lake Pontchartrain Causeway and <a href="../../wp/m/Millau_Viaduct.htm" title="Millau Viaduct">Millau Viaduct</a>.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bridge_types_by_use">Bridge types by use</span></h3>
       <p>A bridge can be categorized by what it is designed to carry, such as trains, pedestrian or road traffic, a pipeline or waterway for water transport or barge traffic. An <!--del_lnk--> aqueduct is a bridge that carries water, resembling a <!--del_lnk--> viaduct, which is a bridge that connects points of equal height. A road-rail bridge carries both road and rail traffic. A bridge can carry overhead power lines as does the <!--del_lnk--> Storstr&oslash;m Bridge.</p>
       <p>Some bridges accommodate other purposes, such as the tower of <!--del_lnk--> Nov&yacute; Most Bridge in <a href="../../wp/b/Bratislava.htm" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>, which features a restaurant, or a <!--del_lnk--> bridge-restaurant which is a bridge built to serve as a restaurant. Other suspension bridge towers carry transmission antennas.</p>
       <p>Bridges are subject to unplanned uses as well. The areas underneath some bridges have become makeshift shelters and homes to homeless people, and the undersides of bridges all around the world are spots of prevalent graffiti. Some bridges attract people attempting <a href="../../wp/s/Suicide.htm" title="Suicide">suicide</a>, and become known as <!--del_lnk--> suicide bridges.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bridge_types_by_material">Bridge types by material</span></h3>
       <p>The materials used to build the structure are also used to categorize bridges. Until the end of the 18th Century, bridges were made out of timber, stone and masonry. Modern bridges are currently built in concrete, steel, fibre reinforced polymers (FRP), stainless steel or combinations of those materials.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/t/The_Iron_Bridge.htm" title="The Iron Bridge">The Iron Bridge</a> completed in 1779 was the first cast iron bridge.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Aesthetics">Aesthetics</span></h2>
       <p>Most bridges are utiltiarian in appearance, but in some cases, the appearance of the bridge can have great importance. Often, this is the case with a large bridge that serves as an entrance to a city, or crosses over a main harbour entrance. These are sometimes known as <i>signature bridges</i>. Designers of bridges in parks and along parkways often place more importance to aesthetics, as well. Examples include the stone-faced bridges along the <!--del_lnk--> Taconic State Parkway in New York.</p>
       <p>To create a beautiful image, some bridges are built much taller than necessary. This type, often found in east-Asian style gardens, is called a <!--del_lnk--> Moon bridge, evoking a rising full moon. Other garden bridges may cross only a dry bed of stream washed pebbles, intended only to convey an impression of a stream. Often in palaces a bridge will be built over an artificial waterway as symbolic of a passage to an important place or state of mind. A set of five bridges cross a sinuous waterway in an important courtyard of the <!--del_lnk--> Forbidden City in <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>. The central bridge was reserved exclusively for the use of the Emperor, Empress, and their attendants.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bridge_maintenance">Bridge maintenance</span></h2>
       <p>Bridge maintenance consisting of a combination of structural health monitoring and testing. This is regulated in country-specific engineer standards and includes e.g. an ongoing monitoring every three to six months, a simple test or inspection every two to three years and a major inspection every six to ten years. In Europe, the cost of maintenance is higher than spending on new bridges. The lifetime of welded steel bridges can be significantly extended by <!--del_lnk--> aftertreatment of the weld transitions . This results in a potential high benefit, using existing bridges far beyond the planned lifetime.</p>

       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bridge_failures">Bridge failures</span></h2>
       <p>The failure of bridges is of special concern for <!--del_lnk--> structural engineers in trying to learn lessons vital to bridge design, construction and maintenance. The failure of bridges first assumed national interest during the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era when many new designs were being built, often using new materials.</p>
       <p>In the United States, the <!--del_lnk--> National Bridge Inventory tracks the structural evaluations of all bridges, including designations such as "structurally deficient" and "functionally obsolete".</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bridge_monitoring">Bridge monitoring</span></h2>
       <p>There are several methods used to monitor the stress on large structures like bridges. The most common method is the use of an <!--del_lnk--> accelerometer, which is integrated into the bridge while it is being built. This technology is used for long-term surveillance of the bridge.</p>
       <p>Another option for structural-integrity monitoring is "non-contact monitoring", which uses the <!--del_lnk--> Doppler effect (Doppler shift). A <a href="../../wp/l/Laser.htm" title="Laser">laser</a> beam from a <!--del_lnk--> Laser Doppler Vibrometer is directed at the point of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface. The advantage of this method is that the setup time for the equipment is faster and, unlike an accelerometer, this makes measurements possible on multiple structures in as short a time as possible. Additionally, this method can measure specific points on a bridge that might be difficult to access.</p>
