       <p>In modern <a href="../../wp/c/Clothing.htm" title="Clothing">clothing</a> and <!--del_lnk--> fashion design, a <b>button</b> is a small <!--del_lnk--> fastener, most commonly made of <a href="../../wp/p/Plastic.htm" title="Plastic">plastic</a>, but also frequently of <!--del_lnk--> seashell, which secures two pieces of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Fabric">fabric</a> together. In <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a>, a button can be a significant <!--del_lnk--> artifact. In the <!--del_lnk--> applied arts and in <!--del_lnk--> craft, a button can be an example of <!--del_lnk--> folk art, <!--del_lnk--> studio craft, or even a miniature <!--del_lnk--> work of art.</p>
       <p>Buttons are most often attached to articles of <a href="../../wp/c/Clothing.htm" title="Clothing">clothing</a> but can also be used on containers such as <!--del_lnk--> wallets and bags. However, buttons may be sewn onto garments and similar items exclusively for purposes of <a href="../../wp/f/Fashion.htm" title="Fashion">ornamentation</a>. Buttons serving as <!--del_lnk--> fasteners work by slipping through a fabric or thread loop, or by sliding through a <!--del_lnk--> buttonhole. Other types of fastenings include zippers, velcro and magnets.</p>

       <p>Buttons and button-like objects used as ornaments or <!--del_lnk--> seals rather than fasteners have been discovered in the <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_Valley_Civilization.htm" title="Indus Valley Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a> during its <!--del_lnk--> Kot Yaman phase (circa 2800&ndash;2600 BCE) as well as <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> sites in <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_China.htm" title="History of China">China</a> (circa 2000&ndash;1500 BCE), and <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Ancient Rome</a>.</p>
       <p>Buttons made from <!--del_lnk--> seashell were used in the Indus Valley Civilization for ornamental purposes by 2000 BCE. Some buttons were carved into <!--del_lnk--> geometric shapes and had holes pierced into them so that they could be attached to clothing with thread. Ian McNeil (1990) holds that: "The button, in fact, was originally used more as an ornament than as a fastening, the earliest known being found at <!--del_lnk--> Mohenjo-daro in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus Valley">Indus Valley</a>. It is made of a curved shell and about 5000 years old."</p>
       <p>Earliest buttons were found in the tombs of conquering Hungarian tribes from the late 9th century. Functional buttons with buttonholes for fastening or closing clothes appeared first in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> in the 13th century. They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting garments in 13th- and 14th-century <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Materials_and_manufacture">Materials and manufacture</span></h2>
       <p>Because buttons have been manufactured from almost every possible material, both <!--del_lnk--> natural and <!--del_lnk--> synthetic, and combinations of both, the history of the material composition of buttons reflects the <!--del_lnk--> timeline of materials technology.</p>
       <p>Buttons can be individually crafted by <!--del_lnk--> artisans, <!--del_lnk--> craftspeople or <!--del_lnk--> artists from <!--del_lnk--> raw materials or <!--del_lnk--> found objects (for example <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossils">fossils</a>), or a combination of both. Alternatively, they can be the product of <!--del_lnk--> low-tech <!--del_lnk--> cottage industry or can be <!--del_lnk--> mass-produced in <!--del_lnk--> high-tech <!--del_lnk--> factories. Buttons made by artists are <!--del_lnk--> art objects, known to button collectors as "studio buttons" (or simply "studios", from <!--del_lnk--> studio craft)The most famous button artist is known as Renarldo Galvies.He was born in 1958 in France and he is known for crafting some of the worlds finest buttons to some button collectors.</p>
       <p>Nowadays, hard plastic, seashell, metals, and <a href="../../wp/w/Wood.htm" title="Wood">wood</a> are the most common materials used in button-making; the others tending to be used only in premium or <!--del_lnk--> antique apparel, or found in <!--del_lnk--> collections.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Decoration_and_coating_techniques">Decoration and coating techniques</span></h2>
       <p>Historically, fashions in buttons have also reflected trends in <!--del_lnk--> applied aesthetics and the <!--del_lnk--> applied <a href="../../wp/v/Visual_arts.htm" title="Visual arts">visual arts</a>, with buttonmakers using techniques from <!--del_lnk--> jewellery making, <!--del_lnk--> ceramics, <a href="../../wp/s/Sculpture.htm" title="Sculpture">sculpture</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Painting.htm" title="Painting">painting</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Printmaking.htm" title="Printmaking">printmaking</a>, <!--del_lnk--> metalworking, <!--del_lnk--> weaving and others. The following are just a few of the construction and decoration techniques that have been used in button-making:</p>

       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> <b>Shank</b> buttons have a hollow protrusion on the back through which thread is sewn to attach the button. Button shanks may be made from a separate piece of the same or a different substance as the button itself, and added to the back of the button, or be carved or moulded directly onto the back of the button, in which latter case the button is referred to by collectors as having a 'self-shank'.</li>
        <li><b>Flat or sew-through</b> buttons have holes through which thread is sewn to attach the button. Flat buttons may be attached by <!--del_lnk--> sewing machine rather than by hand, and may be used with heavy fabrics by working a thread shank to extend the height of the button above the fabric.</li>

        <li><b>Stud buttons</b> (also pressure buttons, press studs or snap fasteners) are metal (usually brass) round discs pinched through the fabric. They are often found on clothing, in particular on denim pieces such as pants and jackets. They are more securely fastened to the material. As they rely on a metal rivet attached securely to the fabric, stud buttons are difficult to remove without compromising the fabric's integrity. They are made of two couple: the male stud couple and the female stud couple. Each couple has one front (or top) and rear (or bottom) side (the fabric goes in the middle).</li>
       </ul>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_fabric_buttons">Types of fabric buttons</span></h2>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Covered buttons</b> are fabric-covered forms with a separate back piece that secures the fabric over the knob.</li>
        <li><b>Mandarin buttons</b> or <!--del_lnk--> Frogs are knobs made of intricately knotted strings. Mandarin buttons are a key element in <!--del_lnk--> Mandarin dress (<i><!--del_lnk--> Qi Pao</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> cheongsam</i> in <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>), where they are closed with loops. Pairs of mandarin buttons worn as <!--del_lnk--> cuff links are called <b>silk knots</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Worked or cloth buttons</b> are created by <!--del_lnk--> embroidering or <!--del_lnk--> crocheting tight stitches (usually with <!--del_lnk--> linen <!--del_lnk--> thread) over a knob or ring called a <b>form</b>.</li>
       </ul>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Button_sizes">Button sizes</span></h2>
       <p>The size of the button depends on its use. Shirt buttons are generally small, and spaced close together, whereas coat buttons are larger and spaced further apart. Buttons are commonly measured in <!--del_lnk--> lignes (also called <i>lines</i> and abbreviated <i>L</i>), with 40 lignes equal to 1&nbsp;inch. For example, some standard sizes of buttons are 16 lignes (10.16&nbsp;mm, standard button of men's <!--del_lnk--> shirts) and 32 lignes (20.32&nbsp;mm, typical button on <!--del_lnk--> suit jackets).<br /> The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> National Button Society (NBS) has its own button sizing system which divides button sizes into 'small', 'medium' and 'large'.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Buttons_as_containers">Buttons as containers</span></h2>
       <p>Since at least the seventeenth century, when box-like metal buttons were constructed especially for the purpose, buttons have been one of the items in which <!--del_lnk--> drug <!--del_lnk--> smugglers have attempted to hide and transport illegal substances. At least one modern smuggler has tried to use this method.</p>
       <p>Also making use of the storage possibilities of metal buttons, during the <!--del_lnk--> World Wars, <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> and <!--del_lnk--> U.S. military <!--del_lnk--> locket buttons were made, containing miniature working <!--del_lnk--> compasses.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Buttons_in_politics">Buttons in politics</span></h2>
       <p>Historically, buttons are a very important part of Western and Near-Eastern culture. They were valued by many European groups for practical and lucrative reasons. Buttons can range from crude buttons made at home out of wood to modern, cheaply made plastic buttons to highly decorative and ornate buttons of precious materials. They are so revered in certain parts of the world that there are some countries where it is illegal to destroy a button.</p>

       <p>The mainly American tradition of politically significant clothing buttons appears to have begun with the <!--del_lnk--> first presidential inauguration of <a href="../../wp/g/George_Washington.htm" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> in 1789. Known to collectors as 'Washington Inaugurals', they were made of <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>, <!--del_lnk--> brass or <!--del_lnk--> Sheffield plate, in large sizes for coats and smaller sizes for breeches. Made in twenty-two patterns and hand-stamped, they are of course now extremely valuable <!--del_lnk--> cultural artifacts.</p>
       <p>Between about 1840 and 1916, clothing buttons were used in American <!--del_lnk--> political campaigns, and still exist in collections today. Initially, these buttons were predominantly made of brass (though horn and rubber buttons with stamped or moulded designs also exist) and had loop shanks. Around 1860 the badge or <!--del_lnk--> pin-back style of construction, which replaced the shanks with long pins, probably for use on lapels and ties, began to appear.</p>
       <p>One common practice that survived until recent times on campaign buttons and badges was to include the image of <a href="../../wp/g/George_Washington.htm" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> with that of the candidate in question.</p>
       <p>Some of the most famous <!--del_lnk--> campaign buttons are those made for <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Memorial buttons commemorating Lincoln's inaugurations and other life events, including his birth and <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm#Assassination" title="Abraham Lincoln">death</a>, were also made, and are also considered highly collectable.</p>
