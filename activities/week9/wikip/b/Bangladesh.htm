Straddling the fertile <!--del_lnk--> Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, it is part of the historic ethno-linguistic region of <!--del_lnk--> Bengal. The name <i>Bangladesh</i> means "Country of Bengal" in the official Bengali language. It faces the <a href="../../wp/b/Bay_of_Bengal.htm" title="Bay of Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> to its south, and is bordered by <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> on the north, west and east, as well as <a href="../../wp/b/Burma.htm" title="Burma">Burma</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Burma.htm" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>) on the southeast. It is separated from the <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalayas">Himalayan</a> nations of <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Bhutan.htm" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> by India&rsquo;s narrow <!--del_lnk--> Siliguri corridor, and is in geographical proximity to <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>.</p>
       <p>The present-day borders of Bangladesh were established during the British <!--del_lnk--> partition of Bengal in 1947, when the region became <!--del_lnk--> East Bengal (later <!--del_lnk--> East Pakistan), part of the newly formed nation of <!--del_lnk--> Pakistan. However, it was separated from <!--del_lnk--> West Pakistan by nearly 1,500&nbsp;km (about 900&nbsp;mi) of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> territory. Due to political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination and economic neglect by the politically dominant western wing, popular agitation grew and gave rise to a secular cultural nationalist movement, leading to the declaration of independence and <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. In the aftermath of war and independence, the new state endured poverty, famine, political turmoil and <!--del_lnk--> military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative calm and economic progress. Today, Bangladesh is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Secular democracy">secular</a>, <!--del_lnk--> unitary, <!--del_lnk--> constitutional republic.</p>
       <p>Bangladesh is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary democracy">parliamentary democracy</a>, with an elected parliament called the <!--del_lnk--> Jatiyo Sangshad. It is the world's <!--del_lnk--> eighth most populous country and has one of the <!--del_lnk--> highest population densities in the world. The country is identified as a <!--del_lnk--> Next Eleven economy. A pioneer of regional engagement in South Asia, Bangladesh is a founding member of <!--del_lnk--> SAARC and <!--del_lnk--> BIMSTEC. It is also member of the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth, the <!--del_lnk--> Non-Aligned Movement, the <!--del_lnk--> OIC, the <!--del_lnk--> Developing 8 Countries and <!--del_lnk--> BIMSTEC.</p>
       <p>The country faces a number of major challenges, including poverty, corruption, overpopulation and vulnerability to climate change. However, it has been noted by the international community for its progress on the Human Development Index. The country has greatly increased life expectancy, achieved gender parity in education, reduced population growth and improved maternal and child health. <a href="../../wp/d/Dhaka.htm" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Chittagong, the country's two largest cities, have been the driving force behind much of the recent growth.</p>

       <p>Remnants of civilization in the greater <!--del_lnk--> Bengal region date back four thousand years, when the region was settled by <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryan, <!--del_lnk--> Dravidian, <!--del_lnk--> Tibeto-Burman, and <!--del_lnk--> Austroasiatic peoples. The exact origin of the word "Bangla" or "Bengal" is not known, though it is believed to be derived from <i>Bang/Vanga</i>, the tribe that settled in the area around the year 1000&nbsp;BCE.</p>
       <p>The early history of Bengal featured the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Vedic states, a succession of Buddhist empires and Hindu dynasties. During the first millennium BCE, the region was home to the <i><!--del_lnk--> janapadas</i> such as <!--del_lnk--> Vanga and <!--del_lnk--> Pundravardhana. The <!--del_lnk--> Gangaridai state arose in the 7th century&nbsp;BCE, and flourished as a seafaring nation. The region was conquered by <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Ashoka in the 2nd century BCE, and was absorbed into the <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan Empire. Bengal was later part of the <!--del_lnk--> Gupta Empire and the <!--del_lnk--> Harsha Empire. Following its collapse, a dynamic Bengali named <!--del_lnk--> Shashanka founded an impressive short-lived kingdom. After a period of anarchy, the Bengali <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> <!--del_lnk--> Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by a shorter reign of the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu <!--del_lnk--> Sena dynasty.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> was introduced to Bengal in the 9th century, by Arab Muslim traders and <!--del_lnk--> Sufi missionaries. Subsequent Muslim rule helped spread Islam throughout the region. <!--del_lnk--> Bakhtiar Khilji, a Turkish general, defeated <!--del_lnk--> Lakshman Sen of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal in the year 1204. The <!--del_lnk--> Sultanate of Bengal was established by <!--del_lnk--> Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah in 1342, and ruled the region for the next few hundred years. The Sultans contributed to the development of Bengali culture through patronizing literature and art, and promoted trade and political relations with China and Persia. By the 16th century, the <a href="../../wp/m/Mughal_Empire.htm" title="Mughal Empire">Mughal Empire</a> controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important provincial centre of administration. Under the Mughals, agrarian reforms and increased foreign trade brought a high level of prosperity to the region, giving rise to the reputation of "Golden Bengal".</p>
       <p>Medieval European geographers located paradise at the mouth of the <a href="../../wp/g/Ganges.htm" title="Ganges">Ganges</a> and although this was overhopeful, Bengal was probably the wealthiest part of the subcontinent until the 17th century. From 1517 onwards, Portuguese traders were traversing the sea-route to Bengal. Only in 1537, were they allowed to settle and open customs houses at Chittagong. In 1577, Mughal emperor Akbar permitted the Portuguese to build permanent settlements and churches in Bengal. The influence of European traders grew until the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> gained control of Bengal following the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Plassey in 1757. The bloody rebellion of 1857&mdash;known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857.htm" title="Sepoy Mutiny">Sepoy Mutiny</a>&mdash;resulted in transfer of authority to the <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Monarchy of the United Kingdom">crown</a> with a British <!--del_lnk--> viceroy running the administration. During colonial rule, famine racked South Asia many times, including the war-induced <!--del_lnk--> Great Bengal famine of 1943 that claimed 3&nbsp;million lives.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Maratha Empire, a Hindu empire which overran the Mughals in the 18th century, also devastated the territories controlled by the Nawab of Bengal between 1742 and 1751. In a series of raids on Bengal and Bihar, then ruled by the Nawab, Maratha demolished much of the Bengali economy, which was unable to withstand the continuous onslaught of Maratha for long. Nawab Ali Vardi Khan made peace with <!--del_lnk--> Maratha by ceding the whole of Orissa and parts of Western Bengal to the empire. In addition, this a tax &ndash; the <i>Chauth</i>, amounting to a quarter of total revenue &ndash; was imposed on other parts of Bengal and Bihar. This tax amounted to twenty <!--del_lnk--> lakhs (of rupees?) for Bengal and 12 lakhs for Bihar per year. After Maratha's defeat in Panipat by a coalition of Muslim forces, the empire returned under the Maratha general Madhoji Sindhia and raided Bengal again. The British Empire stopped payment of the Chauth, invading the territory of Bengal in 1760s. The raids continued until Maratha was finally defeated by the British over the course of three <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Maratha Wars, lasting from 1777 to 1818.</p>

       <p>Between 1905 and 1911, an <!--del_lnk--> abortive attempt was made to divide the <!--del_lnk--> province of Bengal into two zones, with Dhaka being the capital of the eastern zone. With the exit of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> in 1947, Bengal was <!--del_lnk--> partitioned along religious lines, with the western part going to newly created <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and the eastern part (Muslim majority) joining <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> as a province called <!--del_lnk--> East Bengal (later renamed <!--del_lnk--> East Pakistan), with its capital at Dhaka. In 1950, land reform was accomplished in East Bengal with the abolishment of the feudal <!--del_lnk--> zamindari system. Despite the economic and demographic weight of the east, however, Pakistan's government and military were largely dominated by the upper classes from the west. The <!--del_lnk--> Bengali Language Movement of 1952 was the first sign of friction between the two wings of Pakistan. Dissatisfaction with the central government over economic and cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade, during which the <!--del_lnk--> Awami League emerged as the political voice of the Bengali-speaking population. It agitated for <!--del_lnk--> autonomy in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president, <a href="../../wp/s/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman.htm" title="Sheikh Mujibur Rahman">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a> (Mujib), was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising. In 1970, a massive <!--del_lnk--> cyclone devastated the coast of East Pakistan, killing up to half a million people, and the central government responded poorly. The Bengali population's anger was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose <!--del_lnk--> Awami League won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections, was blocked from taking office.</p>

       <p>After staging compromise talks with Mujib, President <!--del_lnk--> Yahya Khan and military officials launched <!--del_lnk--> Operation Searchlight, a sustained military assault on East Pakistan and arrested him in the early hours of 26 March 1971. Yahya's methods were extremely bloody, and the violence of the war resulted in many civilian deaths. Chief targets included intellectuals and Hindus, and about one million <!--del_lnk--> refugees fled to neighbouring India. Estimates of those <!--del_lnk--> massacred throughout the war range from thirty thousand to 3,000,000. Mujibur Rahman was ultimately released on 8 January 1972, due to direct US intervention.</p>
       <p>Awami League leaders set up a government-in-exile in <a href="../../wp/k/Kolkata.htm" title="Kolkata">Calcutta</a>, India. The exile government formally took oath at Meherpur, in Kustia district of East Pakistan on 17 April 1971, with Tajuddin Ahmad as the first Prime Minister and Syed Nazrul Islam as the Acting President. The <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Liberation War lasted for nine months. The <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Forces formed within 11 <!--del_lnk--> sectors led by General M.A.G. Osmani consisting of Bengali Regular forces conducted a massive guerilla war against the Pakistan Forces with support from the <!--del_lnk--> Mukti Bahinis consisting of Kaderia Bahni, Hemayet Bahini, and others financed and equipped by <!--del_lnk--> Indian Armed Forces Maj. Gen. Sujat Singh Uban. The Indian Army, assisted by Bangladeshi forces, negotiated a cease-fire and surrounded the Dhaka Area. The Indian Army remained in Bangladesh until 19 March 1972.</p>
       <p>After its independence, Bangladesh was governed by an Awami League government, with Mujib as the Prime Minister, without holding any elections. In the 1973 parliamentary elections, the Awami League gained an absolute majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974, and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed <!--del_lnk--> BAKSAL. On 15 August 1975, Mujib and most of his family members were assassinated by mid-level military officers. Vice President Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed was sworn in as President with most of Mujib's cabinet intact. Two Army uprisings on 3 November and the other on 7 November 1975 led to the reorganised structure of power. Emergency was declared to restore order and calm, Mushtaq resigned and the country was placed under temporary martial law, with three service chiefs serving as deputies to the new president Justice Abu Sayem, who also became the Chief Martial Law Administrator. Lieutenant General <!--del_lnk--> Ziaur Rahman, took over the presidency in 1977 as Justice Sayem resigned. President Ziaur Rahman reinstated multi-party politics, introduced free markets, and founded the <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Zia's rule ended when he was assassinated by elements of the military in 1981.</p>
       <p>Bangladesh's next major ruler was Lieutenant General <!--del_lnk--> Hussain Mohammad Ershad, who gained power in a coup on 24 March 1982, and ruled until 6 December 1990, when he was forced to resign after a revolt of all major political parties and the public, along with pressure from Western donors (which was a major shift in international policy after the fall of the Soviet Union). Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy. Zia's widow, <!--del_lnk--> Khaleda Zia, led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to parliamentary victory at the general election in 1991, and became the first female Prime Minister in Bangladeshi history. However, the Awami League, headed by <!--del_lnk--> Sheikh Hasina, one of Mujib's surviving daughters, won the next election in 1996. It lost again to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 2001.</p>
       <p>On 11 January 2007, following widespread political unrest spearheaded by the Awami League, the Bangladesh civil and military establishment supported the establishment of a neutral caretaker government. The caretaker government was appointed to administer the next general election. The country had suffered from extensive corruption, disorder and political violence. The caretaker government made it a priority to root out corruption from all levels of government. To this end, many notable politicians and officials, along with large numbers of lesser officials and party members, were arrested on corruption charges. The caretaker government held what it itself described as a largely free and fair election on 29 December 2008. The Awami League's Sheikh Hasina won with a landslide in the elections and took the oath of Prime Minister on 6 January 2009.</p>

       <p>Bangladesh is in the low-lying <!--del_lnk--> Ganges Delta. This delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name <!--del_lnk--> Padma or <i>P&ocirc;dda</i>), <a href="../../wp/b/Brahmaputra_River.htm" title="Brahmaputra River">Brahmaputra</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Jamuna or <i>Jomuna</i> also known as "Yamuna"), and <!--del_lnk--> Meghna rivers and their respective tributaries.

The <!--del_lnk--> alluvial soil deposited by these rivers has created some of the most fertile plains in the world.

       <p>Most parts of Bangladesh are less than 12&nbsp;m (39.4&nbsp;ft) above the sea level, and it is believed that about 10% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1&nbsp;m (3.28&nbsp;ft).</p>
       <p>In southeast Bangladesh, experiments have been done since the 1960s to 'build with nature'. By implementing cross dams, the natural accretion of silt has created new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began to help develop this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has since become a multiagency operation building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some 27,000 acres (10,927&nbsp;ha) to 21,000 families.</p>

As the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and <!--del_lnk--> Meghna spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, 9,700&nbsp;km (6,000&nbsp;mi) of road and 2,700&nbsp;km (1,700&nbsp;mi) of embankment, 1,000&nbsp;people were killed and 30&nbsp;million more were made homeless, with 135,000 cattle killed, 50&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (19&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of land destroyed and 11,000&nbsp;km (6,800&nbsp;mi) of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater. There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high <!--del_lnk--> monsoon rains. Secondly, the <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Thirdly, trees that usually would have intercepted rain water had been cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.</p>
       <p>Bangladesh is now widely recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to <!--del_lnk--> climate change. Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health and shelter. It is believed that in the coming decades the rising sea level alone will create more than 20 million <!--del_lnk--> climate refugees. Bangladeshi water is contaminated with <a href="../../wp/a/Arsenic.htm" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a> frequently because of the high arsenic contents in the soil. Up to 77 million people are <!--del_lnk--> exposed to toxic arsenic from drinking water. Bangladesh is among the countries most prone to natural <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Flood.htm" title="Floods">floods</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tornado.htm" title="Tornado">tornados</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cyclone.htm" title="Cyclone">cyclones</a>. Also, there is evidence that earthquakes pose a threat to the country. Evidence shows that tectonics have caused rivers to shift course suddenly and dramatically. It has been shown that rainy-season flooding in Bangladesh, on the world&rsquo;s largest river delta, can push the underlying crust down by as much as 6 centimetres, and possibly perturb faults.</p>

       <p>Bangladesh is a <!--del_lnk--> unitary state and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary democracy">parliamentary democracy</a>. Direct elections in which all citizens, aged 18 or over, can vote are held every five years for the <!--del_lnk--> unicameral parliament known as the <!--del_lnk--> Jatiyo Sangshad. Currently it has 350 members (including 50 reserved seats for women) elected from single-member constituencies. The <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister, as the <!--del_lnk--> head of government, forms the cabinet and runs the day-to-day affairs of state. While the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister is formally appointed by the <!--del_lnk--> President, he or she must be a <!--del_lnk--> member of parliament who commands the confidence of the majority.</p>
       <p>The President is the <!--del_lnk--> head of state, albeit mainly ceremonially in his/her elected post; however, the President's powers are substantially expanded during the tenure of a <!--del_lnk--> caretaker government, which is responsible for the conduct of elections and transfer of power. The officers of the caretaker government must be non-partisan and are given three months to complete their task. This transitional arrangement was pioneered by Bangladesh in its 1991 election and then institutionalised in 1996 through its 13th constitutional amendment.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Major parties in Bangladesh include the <!--del_lnk--> Awami League, the <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (BJI), and the <!--del_lnk--> Jatiya Party of former military dictator Ershad. <!--del_lnk--> Sheikh Hasina's Awami League aligns with more <!--del_lnk--> leftist parties, whereas <!--del_lnk--> Khaleda Zia's BNP has politically been allied with <!--del_lnk--> Islamist parties like the BJI but practices secular politics. The former two have been bitter, dominant political rivals for over 15 years; each is related to one of the leaders of the independence movement. The Awami League-BNP rivalry has been punctuated by protests, violence and murder. Student politics are particularly strong in Bangladesh, a legacy from the liberation movement era, as almost all parties have highly active student wings, and student leaders have been elected to the Jatiyo Sangshad.</p>
       <p>On 11 January 2007, following widespread political unrest, emergency law was declared and a caretaker government was appointed to administer the next general election. The 22 January 2007 election was postponed indefinitely as the Army-backed caretaker government of <!--del_lnk--> Fakhruddin Ahmed aimed to prepare a new voter list and crack down on corruption. They also assisted the interim government of Bangladesh in a drive against corruption, which resulted in Bangladesh's position in <!--del_lnk--> Transparency International's <!--del_lnk--> Corruption Perceptions Index changed from the very bottom, where they had been for 3 years in a row, to 147th in just 1 year. A large alliance led by the Bangladesh Awami League won in a 29 December 2008 landslide victory, gaining 230 seats among 300 seats in the parliament.</p>

       <p>Divisions are subdivided into districts (<i>zila</i>). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into <i>upazila</i> (subdistricts) or <i>thana</i>. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several <!--del_lnk--> <i>unions</i>, with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into <i>mahallas</i>. There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.</p>

       <p>The legal system of Bangladesh is primarily in accordance with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/English_law.htm" title="English legal system">English legal system</a>, although since 1947 the legal scenario and the laws of Bangladesh have drifted far from the West owing to differences in socio-cultural values and religious guidelines. Laws are loosely based on <a href="../../wp/e/English_law.htm" title="English law">English common law</a>, but family laws such as marriage and inheritance are based on religious scriptures, and therefore differ between religious communities.

       <p>The highest <!--del_lnk--> judicial body is the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court, with justices appointed by the President. The judicial and law enforcement institutions are comparatively weak. On 1 November 2007, Bangladesh successfully separated the Judiciary Branch from the Executive, but several black laws, including the Special Powers Act, still influence the rulers. It is expected that this separation will make the judiciary stronger and more impartial.</p>

       <p>Bangladesh pursues a moderate foreign policy that places heavy reliance on multinational diplomacy, especially at the United Nations. In 1974, Bangladesh joined both the <a href="../../wp/c/Commonwealth_of_Nations.htm" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> and the United Nations, and has since been elected to serve two terms on the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_Security_Council.htm" title="United Nations Security Council">Security Council</a> &ndash; in 1978&ndash;1979 and 2000&ndash;2001. In the 1980s, Bangladesh played a lead role in founding the <!--del_lnk--> South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in order to expand relations with other South Asian states. In more recent years, Bangladeshi foreign policy has focused on promoting regional economic integration in South Asia, as well as the wider neighbourhood.</p>
       <p>Bangladesh's most important and complex foreign relationship is with <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. This relationship is formed by historical and cultural ties and is strengthened because of India's involvement in liberating the people of Bangladesh from Pakistan. This forms an important part of the domestic political discourse. Bangladesh's <!--del_lnk--> relationship with India began on a positive note because of India's assistance in the <!--del_lnk--> independence war and subsequent reconstruction. Throughout the years, the relationship between the two countries has fluctuated for a number of reasons. A major source of tension between Bangladesh and India is the <!--del_lnk--> Farakka Dam. In 1975, India constructed a dam on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Ganges.htm" title="Ganges River">Ganges River</a> 10.3&nbsp;mi (16.6&nbsp;km) from the Bangladeshi border. Bangladesh alleges that the dam diverts much needed water from Bangladesh and adds a man-made disaster to a country already plagued by natural disasters. However, both countries recognize the importance of good relations, regional security and South Asian economic integration. In 2009, Bangladeshi security forces launched a crackdown on Indian insurgents hiding in the country's border regions, captured and deported the leaders of several insurgent groups. Bangladesh and India have also agreed to develop regional <!--del_lnk--> connectivity and economic integration, along with <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Bhutan.htm" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>. India's eastern states, as well as Nepal and Bhutan, are keen to gain access to Bangladesh's <!--del_lnk--> Chittagong and <!--del_lnk--> Mongla ports.</p>
       <p>Bangladesh enjoys very warm ties with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>, and particularly in the past decade, there has been increased economic cooperation between them. Between 2006 and 2007, trade between the two nations rose by 28.5% and there have been agreements to grant various Bangladeshi commodities tariff-free access to the Chinese market. Cooperation between the <!--del_lnk--> Military of Bangladesh and the <!--del_lnk--> People's Liberation Army is also increasing, with joint military agreements signed and Bangladesh purchasing Chinese arms which range from small arms to large naval surface combat ships such as the Chinese <!--del_lnk--> Type 053H1 Missile Frigate.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> is a major development partner of Bangladesh, giving over six billion dollars in aid since 1972. American companies are the largest foreign investors in the country, and the US is also the largest market for Bangladeshi exports. Bangladesh participated in the <!--del_lnk--> US-led coalition during the <!--del_lnk--> 1991 Gulf War to liberate <a href="../../wp/k/Kuwait.htm" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>, and supports the US-led reconstruction of <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> US Military has taken part in several disaster management and relief operations in aftermath of devastating floods and cyclones to have hit Bangladesh, including <!--del_lnk--> Cyclone O2B and <a href="../../wp/c/Cyclone_Sidr.htm" title="Cyclone Sidr">Cyclone Sidr</a>.</p>
       <p>As of 2012, the current strength of the army is around 300,000 including reservists, the air force 22,000, and navy 19,000. In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has been called on to provide support to civil authorities for disaster relief and internal security during periods of political unrest. Bangladesh is not currently active in any ongoing war, but it contributed 2,300 troops during <!--del_lnk--> Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and is the world's largest contributor (10,736) to <!--del_lnk--> UN peacekeeping forces. In May 2007, Bangladesh had major deployments in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo.htm" title="Democratic Republic of Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>, Liberia, <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/East_Timor.htm" title="Timor-Leste">Timor-Leste</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Ivory_Coast.htm" title="Cote d'Ivoire">C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire</a>.</p>

       <p>Bangladesh is a <!--del_lnk--> developing nation. <!--del_lnk--> Goldman Sachs named it one of the "<!--del_lnk--> Next Eleven". Bangladesh gradually decreased its dependency on foreign grant and loan from 85% (In 1988) to 2% (In 2010) for its annual development budget. Its per capita income in 2010 was US$641 compared to the world average of $8,985. In December 2005, the <!--del_lnk--> Central Bank of Bangladesh projected GDP growth around 6.5%.</p>
       <p>Bangladesh has seen a dramatic increase in <!--del_lnk--> foreign direct investment. In order to enhance economic growth, the government set up several export processing zones to attract foreign investment. These are managed by the <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority.</p>
       <p>The insufficient power supply constitutes an obstacle to growth. According to the World Bank, "among Bangladesh&rsquo;s most significant obstacles to growth are poor governance and weak public institutions." In April 2010, <!--del_lnk--> Standard &amp; Poor's awarded Bangladesh a BB- for a long term in <!--del_lnk--> credit rating which is below India and well over Pakistan and Sri Lanka in South Asia.</p>
       <p>One significant contributor to the development of the economy has been the widespread propagation of <!--del_lnk--> microcredit by <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Yunus (awarded the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 2006) through the <!--del_lnk--> Grameen Bank. By the late 1990s, Grameen Bank had 2.3&nbsp;million members, along with 2.5&nbsp;million members of other similar organisations.</p>
       <p>Bangladesh government is planning for construction of the largest deep sea port in South Asia at Sonadia Island. The 500 billion <!--del_lnk--> taka project will be completed in multiple phases and enable Bangladesh to service the whole region as a maritime transport and logistics hub. India, China, <a href="../../wp/b/Bhutan.htm" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, Nepal and other neighbouring countries will be able to take full advantage of the strategic location and Bangladesh&rsquo;s LDC status for exporting their goods, which are manufactured in Bangladesh.</p>
       <p>Furthermore, with $7.5 billion a new international airport will be constructed. The airport is being modelled on <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Suvarnabhumi Airport in size and capacity.</p>
       <p>To ease the chaotic <!--del_lnk--> traffic congestion in the capital <a href="../../wp/d/Dhaka.htm" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> the government plans to construct more <!--del_lnk--> expressways, freeways, and <!--del_lnk--> flyovers. There is a plan to build an overhead <!--del_lnk--> Rapid transit called <!--del_lnk--> Dhaka Metro, but the progress is slow and controversial because of contracts and agreements.</p>
       <p>Recently the government of Bangladesh signed a deal with a Chinese company to provide high-speed modern DEMU trains and is also going to construct metro rail system and high-speed electric powered inter city rail network. More airports, bridge (such as the multi-billion <!--del_lnk--> Padma Bridge project) national highways are also being constructed to facilitate trade and regional development.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Jute was once the economic engine of the country. Its share of the world export market peaked in the Second World War and the late 1940s at 80% and even in the early 1970s accounted for 70% of its export earnings. However, <!--del_lnk--> polypropylene products began to substitute for jute products worldwide and the jute industry started to decline.

       <p>More than three-quarters of Bangladesh&rsquo;s export earnings come from the <!--del_lnk--> garment industry in 2005. The industry began attracting foreign investors in the 1980s due to cheap labour and low conversion cost. In 2011&ndash;12 fiscal year the industry exported US$ 18 billion worth of products where in 2002 the exported amount was US$ 5 billion. Bangladesh has been ranked as the 4th largest clothing exporter by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/World_Trade_Organization.htm" title="WTO">WTO</a> (The World Trade Organization) . whereas, according to <i><!--del_lnk--> The Economist</i> Bangladesh is the world&rsquo;s third-largest clothes-export industry. The industry now employs more than 3&nbsp;million workers, 90% of whom are women.</p>
       <p>There has also been a significant growth to Bangladesh's ship building industry in the last few years. The required ships and vessels in the country are being produced by the local shipbuilders. Furthermore, they have already started taking orders and executing them perfectly for foreign companies from Germany, Denmark and other European countries who prefer the cheap market of Bangladesh over their local market. The <!--del_lnk--> Khulna Shipyard have successfully completed building a Khulna Class LPC(Large <!--del_lnk--> Patrol Craft) and a <!--del_lnk--> LCVP(Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel) for the <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Navy and <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Army respectively, the cost being almost half of their import price. They are to build 5 more LPCs of the same class in the coming year.</p>

In 1951, the population was 44 million. It is also the most densely populated large country in the world, and it ranks 11th in population density, when very small countries and city-states are included.</p>
       <p>Bangladesh's population growth rate was among the highest in the world in the 1960s and 1970s, when the country swelled from 65 to 110&nbsp;million. With the promotion of <a href="../../wp/b/Birth_control.htm" title="Birth control">birth control</a> in the 1980s, the growth rate began to slow.The fertility rate now stands at 2.55, lower than <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> (2.58) and <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> (3.07) The population is relatively young, with 34% aged 15 or younger and 5% 65 or older. <!--del_lnk--> Life expectancy at birth is estimated to be 70 years for both males and females in 2012.</p>
       <p>The overwhelming majority of Bangladeshis are ethnic <!--del_lnk--> Bengali, constituting 98% of the population. The remainder are mostly <!--del_lnk--> Biharis and indigenous tribal groups. There is also a small but growing population of <!--del_lnk--> Rohingya refugees from <a href="../../wp/b/Burma.htm" title="Burma">Burma</a> around <!--del_lnk--> Cox's Bazaar, which Bangladesh seeks to repatriate to Burma. The tribal peoples are concentrated in the <!--del_lnk--> Chittagong Hill Tracts in the southeast. There are 45 tribal groups located in this region, the largest being the <!--del_lnk--> Chakma. The Hill Tracts region has been a source of unrest and separatism since and before the inception of Bangladesh. Outside the Hill Tracts, the largest tribal groups are the <!--del_lnk--> Santhals and <!--del_lnk--> Garos (Achiks), while smaller groups include the <!--del_lnk--> Kaibarta, <!--del_lnk--> Meitei, <!--del_lnk--> Mundas, <!--del_lnk--> Oraons, and <!--del_lnk--> Zomi.</p>

In the tertiary education sector, the government also funds more than 15 state universities through the <!--del_lnk--> University Grants Commission.</p>
       <p>The education system is divided into 5 levels: Primary (from grades 1 to 5), Junior Secondary (from grades 6 to 8), Secondary (from grades 9 to 10), Higher Secondary (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary. The five years of lower secondary education concludes with a <!--del_lnk--> Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination but since 2009 it concludes with a Primary Education Closing (PEC) Examination.

For those in rural areas, village doctors with little or no formal training constitute 62% of the healthcare providers practising modern medicine and the formally trained providers are occupying a mere 4% of the total health workforce. A survey conducted by Future Health Systems revealed significant deficiencies in treatment practices of village doctors, with a wide prevalence of harmful and inappropriate drug prescriptions. There are market incentives for accessing health care through informal providers and it is important to understand these markets in order to facilitate collaboration across actors and institutions in order to provide incentives for better performance.</p>
       <p>A 2007 study of 1000 households in rural Bangladesh found that direct costs (payment to formal and informal health care providers) and indirect costs (loss of earnings associated with workdays lost due to illness) associated with illness were important deterrents to accessing health care from qualified healthcare providers. A community survey with 6183 individuals in rural Bangladesh found a clear gender difference in treatment-seeking behaviour, with women less likely to seek treatment compared to men. The use of skilled birth attendants, however, has risen between 2005 and 2007 by women in all wealth quintiles except the highest quintile. A pilot community empowerment tool, called a health watch, was successfully developed and implemented in south-eastern Bangladesh in order to improve uptake and monitoring of public health services.</p>
       <p>The poor health conditions in Bangladesh is attributed by the lack of healthcare and services provision by the government. The total expenditure on healthcare as a percentage of their GDP was only 3.35% in 2009, according to a World Bank report published in 2010. The number of hospital beds per 10 000 population is 4. The General government expenditure on healthcare as a percentage of total government expenditure was only 7.9% as of 2009 and the citizens pay most of their health care bills as the out-of-pocket expenditure as a percentage of private expenditure on health is 96.5%.</p>
       <p>Malnutrition has been a persistent problem for the poverty-stricken country. The <!--del_lnk--> World Bank estimates that Bangladesh is ranked 1st in the world of the number of children suffering from <a href="../../wp/m/Malnutrition.htm" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a> In Bangladesh, 26% of the population are undernourished and 46% of the children suffers from moderate to severe underweight problem. 43% of children under 5 years old are stunted. One in five preschool age children are vitamin A deficient and one in two are anaemia. Child malnutrition in Bangladesh is amongst the highest in the world. Two-thirds of the children, under the age of five, are under-nourished and about 60% of them, who are under six, are stunted. More than 45 percent of rural families and 76 percent of urban families were below the acceptable caloric intake level.</p>

       <p>The <a href="../../wp/b/Bengali_language.htm" title="Bengali language">Bengali language</a> boasts a rich literary heritage, which Bangladesh shares with the Indian state of West Bengal. The earliest literary text in Bengali is the 8th century <!--del_lnk--> Charyapada. Medieval Bengali literature was often either religious (for example, <!--del_lnk--> Chandidas), or adapted from other languages (for example, <!--del_lnk--> Alaol). Bengali literature reached its full expression in the 19th century, with its greatest icons being poets, the national poet <!--del_lnk--> Kazi Nazrul Islam, <a href="../../wp/r/Rabindranath_Tagore.htm" title="Rabindranath Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Sarat Chandra, <!--del_lnk--> Jasim Uddin, <!--del_lnk--> Jibanananda Das, <!--del_lnk--> Shamsur Rahman, <!--del_lnk--> Al Mahmud, <!--del_lnk--> Sukanta Bhattacharya, <!--del_lnk--> Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, <!--del_lnk--> Michael Madhusudan Dutt and present day <!--del_lnk--> Humayun Ahmed, <!--del_lnk--> Muhammed Zafar Iqbal. Bangladesh also has a long tradition in folk literature, for example <i><!--del_lnk--> Maimansingha Gitika</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Thakurmar Jhuli</i> and stories related to <i><!--del_lnk--> Gopal Bhar</i>, <i>Birbal</i> and <i>Molla Nasiruddin</i>.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Music_and_Arts">Music and Arts</span></h3>
       <p>The musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based (<i>Baniprodhan</i>), with minimal instrumental accompaniment. Numerous musical traditions exist including <!--del_lnk--> Gombhira, <!--del_lnk--> Bhatiali and <!--del_lnk--> Bhawaiya, varying from one region to the next. Folk music is accompanied by the <!--del_lnk--> ektara, an instrument with only one string. Other instruments include the <!--del_lnk--> dotara, <!--del_lnk--> dhol, <a href="../../wp/f/Flute.htm" title="Flute">flute</a> and <!--del_lnk--> tabla. Bangladesh also has an active heritage in <!--del_lnk--> North Indian classical music. Similarly, Bangladeshi dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance tradition. Bangladesh produces about 80 films a year. Mainstream <!--del_lnk--> Hindi films are also quite popular.</p>

       <p>The culinary tradition of Bangladesh has close relations to surrounding Bengali and North-East Indian cuisine as well as having its own unique traits. Rice and fish are traditional favourites. <!--del_lnk--> Biryani is a favourite dish of Bangladesh and this includes egg biryani, mutton biryani and beef biryani.

       <p>The Muslim holidays of <!--del_lnk--> Eid ul-Fitr and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Eid_al-Adha.htm" title="Eid ul-Adha">Eid ul-Adha</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Bengali New Year, <!--del_lnk--> Independence Day, and <!--del_lnk--> Durga Puja by the significant Hindu community of Bangladesh, see the most widespread celebrations in the country. Other major Hindu festivals are <!--del_lnk--> Kali Puja, <!--del_lnk--> Saraswati Puja, and <!--del_lnk--> Krishna Janmashtami; alongside the Buddhist festival of <!--del_lnk--> Buddha Purnima, which marks the birth of <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>, and Christmas, called <i>Borodin</i> ("Great day"), are all (except Saraswati and Kali Puja) <!--del_lnk--> national holidays.</p>
       <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Pohela Boishakh</i>, the Bengali new year, is the major festival of <!--del_lnk--> Bengali culture and sees widespread festivities. Of the major holidays celebrated in Bangladesh, only <i>Pohela Boishakh</i> comes without any preexisting expectations (specific religious identity, culture of gift-giving, etc.). Unlike holidays like Eid ul-Fitr, where dressing up in lavish clothes has become a norm, or Christmas where exchanging gifts has become an integral part of the holiday, Pohela Boishakh is really about celebrating the simpler, rural roots of the Bengal. As a result, more people can participate in the festivities together without the burden of having to reveal one's class, religion, or financial capacity. Other cultural festivals include <!--del_lnk--> Nabonno, and <i>Poush porbon</i> (festival of <!--del_lnk--> Poush), both Bengali harvest festivals.</p>
       <p>Alongside these are national days like the remembrance of 21 February 1952 <!--del_lnk--> Language Movement Day (<!--del_lnk--> International Mother Language Day), <!--del_lnk--> Independence Day and <!--del_lnk--> Victory Day. On Language Movement Day, people congregate at the <!--del_lnk--> Shaheed Minar in Dhaka to remember the national heroes of the <!--del_lnk--> Bengali Language Movement, and at the <!--del_lnk--> Jatiyo Smriti Soudho on Independence Day and Victory Day to remember the national heroes of the <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Liberation War. These occasions are observed with public ceremonies, parades, rallies by citizens, political speeches, fairs, concerts, and various other public and private events celebrating the history and traditions of Bangladesh. TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs. And many schools and colleges organise fairs, festivals, and concerts in which citizens from all levels of society can participate.</p>
