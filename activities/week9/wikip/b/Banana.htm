       <p><b>Banana</b> is the <!--del_lnk--> common name for an edible fruit produced by several kinds of large <!--del_lnk--> herbaceous <!--del_lnk--> flowering plants of the <a href="../../wp/g/Genus.htm" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Musa</i>. The fruit is variable in size, colour and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in <!--del_lnk--> starch covered with a rind which may be yellow, purple or red when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible <!--del_lnk--> parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species &ndash; <i><!--del_lnk--> Musa acuminata</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Musa balbisiana</i>. The <a href="../../wp/b/Binomial_nomenclature.htm" title="Binomial nomenclature">scientific names</a> of most cultivated bananas are <i><b>Musa acuminata</b></i>, <i><b>Musa balbisiana</b></i>, and <b><i>Musa</i> &times; <i>paradisiaca</i></b> for the hybrid <i>Musa acuminata</i> &times; <i>M.&nbsp;balbisiana</i>, depending on their <!--del_lnk--> genomic constitution. The old scientific name <i>Musa sapientum</i> is no longer used.</p>
       <p><i>Musa</i> species are native to tropical South and Southeast Asia, and are likely to have been first domesticated in <a href="../../wp/p/Papua_New_Guinea.htm" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. They are grown in at least 107 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make <!--del_lnk--> fibre, <!--del_lnk--> banana wine and as <!--del_lnk--> ornamental plants.</p>
       <p>Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between "bananas" and "plantains". Especially in the Americas and Europe, "banana" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the <a href="#Cavendish">Cavendish group</a>, which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Musa</i> cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit are called "plantains". In other regions, such as <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia, many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so that the simple two-fold distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.</p>
       <p>The term "banana" is also used as the common name for the plants which produce the fruit. This can extend to other members of the genus <i>Musa</i> like the <!--del_lnk--> scarlet banana (<i>Musa coccinea</i>), <!--del_lnk--> pink banana (<i>Musa velutina</i>) and the <!--del_lnk--> Fe'i bananas. It can also refer to members of the genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Ensete</i>, like the <!--del_lnk--> snow banana (<i>Ensete glaucum</i>) and the economically important <!--del_lnk--> false banana (<i>Ensete ventricosum</i>). Both genera are classified under the banana family, <!--del_lnk--> Musaceae.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The banana plant is the largest <!--del_lnk--> herbaceous flowering plant. All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a "<!--del_lnk--> corm". Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">trees</a>, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a "false stem" or <!--del_lnk--> pseudostem. The leaves of banana plants are composed of a "stalk" (<!--del_lnk--> petiole) and a blade (<!--del_lnk--> lamina). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart. Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) to 'Gros Michel' at 7&nbsp;m (23&nbsp;ft) or more. Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow 2.7 metres (8.9&nbsp;ft) long and 60&nbsp;cm (2.0&nbsp;ft) wide. They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.</p>
       <p>When a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or <!--del_lnk--> inflorescence. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top. Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the "banana heart". (More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> produced five.) After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is <!--del_lnk--> perennial. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing. The inflorescence contains many <!--del_lnk--> bracts (sometimes incorrectly called petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is <!--del_lnk--> inferior, meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.</p>
       <p>The banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called "hands"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3&ndash;20 <!--del_lnk--> tiers, or commercially as a "banana stem", and can weigh from 30&ndash;50 kilograms (66&ndash;110&nbsp;lb). Individual banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or "finger") average 125 grams (0.28&nbsp;lb), of which approximately 75% is <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> and 25% dry matter.</p>
       <p>The fruit has been described as a "leathery berry". There is a protective outer layer (a <!--del_lnk--> peel or skin) with numerous long, thin strings (the <!--del_lnk--> phloem <!--del_lnk--> bundles), which run lengthwise between the skin and the <!--del_lnk--> edible inner portion. The inner part of the common yellow dessert variety splits easily lengthwise into three sections that correspond to the inner portions of the three <!--del_lnk--> carpels. In cultivated varieties, the seeds are diminished nearly to non-existence; their remnants are tiny black specks in the interior of the fruit.</p>
       <p>Bananas are naturally slightly <!--del_lnk--> radioactive, more so than most other fruits, because of their potassium content and the small amounts of the isotope <!--del_lnk--> potassium-40 found in naturally occurring potassium. <!--del_lnk--> Proponents of nuclear power sometimes refer to the <!--del_lnk--> banana equivalent dose of radiation to support their arguments.</p>

       <p>The genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Musa</i> is in the family <!--del_lnk--> Musaceae. The <!--del_lnk--> APG III system assigns Musaceae to the order <!--del_lnk--> Zingiberales, part of the <!--del_lnk--> commelinid clade of the <!--del_lnk--> monocotyledonous flowering plants.</p>
       <p>Some sources assert that <i>Musa</i> is named for <!--del_lnk--> Antonius Musa, physician to the Emperor <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Augustus</a>. Others say that <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Carl_Linnaeus.htm" title="Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>, who named the genus in 1750, simply adapted an <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> word for banana, <i><!--del_lnk--> mauz</i>. The word <i>banana</i> is generally said to be derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Wolof word <i><!--del_lnk--> banaana</i>. Some 70 species of <i>Musa</i> were recognized by the <!--del_lnk--> World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as of January 2013; several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.</p>
       <p>Banana classification has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally classified bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: <i>Musa sapientum</i> for dessert bananas and <i>Musa paradisiaca</i> for <!--del_lnk--> plantains. Subsequently further species names were added. However, this approach proved inadequate to address the sheer number of <a href="../../wp/c/Cultivar.htm" title="Cultivar">cultivars</a> existing in the primary centre of diversity of the genus, <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia. Many of these cultivars were given names which proved to be <!--del_lnk--> synonyms.</p>
       <p>In a series of papers published in 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus' <i>Musa sapientum</i> and <i>Musa paradisiaca</i> were actually cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, <i><!--del_lnk--> Musa acuminata</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Musa balbisiana</i>, both first described by <!--del_lnk--> Luigi Aloysius Colla. He recommended the abolition of Linnaeus' species in favour of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars &ndash; those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of <i>Musa balbisiana</i>, those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of <i>Musa acuminata</i>, and those with characteristics that are the combination of the two. Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on Linnaeus' <i>Musa sapientum</i> and <i>Musa paradisiaca</i>. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities today, leading to confusion.</p>
       <p>The currently accepted <!--del_lnk--> scientific names for bananas are <i><b>Musa acuminata</b></i> <small>Colla</small> and <i><b>Musa balbisiana</b></i> <small>Colla</small> for the ancestral species, and <b><i>Musa</i> &times; <i>paradisiaca</i></b> <small>L.</small> for the hybrid <i>M. acuminata</i> &times; <i>M. balbisiana</i>.</p>

       </ul>
       <p>Generally, modern classifications of banana cultivars follow Simmonds and Shepherd's system. Cultivars are placed in groups based on the number of chromosomes they have and which species they are derived from. Thus the <!--del_lnk--> Latundan banana is placed in the AAB Group, showing that it is a triploid derived from both <i>M. acuminata</i> (A) and <i>M. balbisiana</i> (B). For a list of the cultivars classified under this system see <!--del_lnk--> List of banana cultivars.</p>
       <p>In 2012 a team of scientists announced they had achieved a draft sequence of the genome of <i><!--del_lnk--> Musa acuminata</i>.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bananas_and_plantains">Bananas and plantains</span></h2>
       <p>In regions such as North America and Europe, <i>Musa</i> fruits offered for sale can be divided into "bananas" and "plantains", based on their intended use as food. Thus the banana producer and distributor <!--del_lnk--> Chiquita produces publicity material for the American market which says that "a plantain is not a banana". The stated differences are that plantains are more <!--del_lnk--> starchy and less sweet; they are eaten cooked rather than raw; they have thicker skin, which may be green, yellow or black; and they can be used at any stage of ripeness. Linnaeus made the same distinction between plantains and bananas when first naming two "species" of <i>Musa</i>. Members of the "<!--del_lnk--> Plantain subgroup" of banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to the Chiquita description, having long pointed fruit. They are described by Ploetz et al. as "true" plantains, distinct from other cooking bananas. The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, the <!--del_lnk--> East African Highland bananas, so would not qualify as "true" plantains on this definition.</p>
       <p>An alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas, with plantains being one of the subgroups of cooking bananas. <!--del_lnk--> Triploid cultivars derived solely from <i>M.&nbsp;acuminata</i> are examples of "dessert bananas", whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between <i>M.&nbsp;acuminata</i> and <i>M.&nbsp;balbinosa</i> (in particular the Plantain subgroup of the <!--del_lnk--> AAB Group) are "plantains".  Small farmers in <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> grow a much wider range of cultivars than large commercial plantations. A study of these cultivars showed that they could be placed into at least three groups based on their characteristics: dessert bananas, non-plantain cooking bananas, and plantains, although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas.</p>
       <p>In Southeast Asia &ndash; the centre of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated &ndash; the distinction between "bananas" and "plantains" does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many bananas are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas. Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between "bananas" and "plantains" that is made in English (and Spanish). Thus both <a href="#Cavendish">Cavendish cultivars</a>, the classic yellow dessert bananas, and <!--del_lnk--> Saba cultivars, used mainly for cooking, are called <i>pisang</i> in <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <i>kluai</i> in <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and <i>chuoi</i> in <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Fe'i bananas, grown and eaten in the islands of the Pacific, are derived from entirely different wild species than traditional bananas and plantains. Most Fe'i bananas are cooked, but <!--del_lnk--> Karat bananas, which are short and squat with bright red skins, very different from the usual yellow dessert bananas, are eaten raw.</p>
       <p>In summary, in commerce in Europe and the Americas (although not in small-scale cultivation), it is possible to distinguish between "bananas", which are eaten raw, and "plantains", which are cooked. In other regions of the world, particularly India, Southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific, there are many more kinds of banana and the two-fold distinction is not useful and not made in local languages. Plantains are one of many kinds of cooking bananas, which are not always distinct from dessert bananas.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Phytolith discoveries in <a href="../../wp/c/Cameroon.htm" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> dating to the first millennium BCE triggered an as yet unresolved debate about the date of first cultivation in Africa. There is linguistic evidence that bananas were known in <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> around that time. The earliest prior evidence indicates that cultivation dates to no earlier than late 6th century CE. It is likely, however, that bananas were brought at least to <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> if not to the East African coast during the phase of <!--del_lnk--> Malagasy colonization of the island from South East Asia c. 400 CE.</p>

There is some textual evidence that <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> was familiar with bananas. The <!--del_lnk--> spread of Islam was followed by far-reaching diffusion. There are numerous references to it in Islamic texts (such as poems and <!--del_lnk--> hadiths) beginning in the 9th century. By the 10th century the banana appears in texts from <!--del_lnk--> Palestine and <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. From there it diffused into north Africa and <!--del_lnk--> Muslim Iberia. During the medieval ages, bananas from <!--del_lnk--> Granada were considered among the best in the Arab world. In 650, Islamic conquerors brought the banana to Palestine. Today, banana consumption increases significantly in Islamic countries during <!--del_lnk--> Ramadan, the month of daylight fasting.</p>

       <p>In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portuguese colonists started banana plantations in the Atlantic Islands, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and western Africa. North Americans began consuming bananas on a small scale at very high prices shortly after the Civil War, though it was only in the 1880s that it became more widespread. As late as the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian Era, bananas were not widely known in Europe, although they were available. <!--del_lnk--> Jules Verne introduces bananas to his readers with detailed descriptions in <i><!--del_lnk--> Around the World in Eighty Days</i> (1872).</p>
       <p>The earliest modern plantations originated in Jamaica and the related <!--del_lnk--> Western Caribbean Zone, including most of <a href="../../wp/c/Central_America.htm" title="Central America">Central America</a>. It involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed bananas to have more time between harvesting and ripening. North America shippers like <!--del_lnk--> Lorenzo Dow Baker and <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Preston, the founders of the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Fruit Company started this process in the 1870s, but railroad builders like <!--del_lnk--> Minor C Keith also participated, eventually culminating in the multi-national giant corporations like today's <!--del_lnk--> Chiquita Brands International and <!--del_lnk--> Dole. These companies were monopolistic, <!--del_lnk--> vertically integrated (meaning they controlled growing, processing, shipping and marketing) and usually used political manipulation to build <!--del_lnk--> enclave economies (economies that were internally self-sufficient, virtually tax exempt, and export oriented that contribute very little to the host economy). Their political maneuvers, which gave rise to the term <!--del_lnk--> Banana republic for states like Honduras and Guatemala, included working with local elites and their rivalries to influence politics or playing the international interests of the United States, especially during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, to keep the political climate favorable to their interests.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Peasant_cultivation_for_export_in_the_Caribbean">Peasant cultivation for export in the Caribbean</span></h3>
       <p>The vast majority of the world's bananas today are cultivated for family consumption or for sale on local markets. India is the world leader in this sort of production, but many other Asian and African countries where climate and soil conditions allow cultivation also host large populations of banana growers who sell at least some of their crop.</p>
       <p>There are peasant sector banana growers who produce for the world market in the Caribbean, however. The <!--del_lnk--> Windward Islands are notable for the growing, largely of Cavendish bananas, for an international market, generally in Europe but also in North America. In the Caribbean, and especially in Dominica where this sort of cultivation is widespread, holdings are in the 1&ndash;2 acre range. In many cases the farmer earns additional money from other crops, from engaging in labor outside the farm, and from a share of the earnings of relatives living overseas. This style of cultivation often was popular in the islands as bananas required little labor input and brought welcome extra income. Banana crops are vulnerable to destruction by high winds, such as tropical storms or <a href="../../wp/c/Cyclone.htm" title="Cyclone">cyclones</a>.</p>
       <p>After the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> NAFTA agreements in the 1990s, however, the tide turned against peasant producers. Their costs of production were relatively high and the ending of favorable tariff and other supports, especially in the European Economic Community, made it difficult for peasant producers to compete with the bananas grown on large plantations by the well capitalized firms like Chiquita and Dole. Not only did the large companies have access to cheap labor in the areas they worked, but they were better able to afford modern agronomic advances such as fertilization. The "dollar banana" produced by these concerns made the profit margins for peasant bananas unsustainable.</p>
       <p>Caribbean countries have sought to redress this problem by providing government supported agronomic services and helping to organize producers' cooperatives. They have also been supporters of the <!--del_lnk--> Fair Trade movement which seeks to balance the inequities in the world trade in commodities.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="East_Africa">East Africa</span></h3>
       <p>Most farms supply local consumption. Cooking bananas represent a major food source and a major <!--del_lnk--> income source for smallhold farmers. In east Africa, <!--del_lnk--> highland bananas are of greatest importance as a staple food crop. In countries such as <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Burundi.htm" title="Burundi">Burundi</a>, and <a href="../../wp/r/Rwanda.htm" title="Rwanda">Rwanda</a> per capita consumption has been estimated at 45 kilograms (99&nbsp;lb) per year, the highest in the world.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_cultivation">Modern cultivation</span></h2>
       <p>All widely cultivated bananas today descend from the two wild bananas <i>Musa acuminata</i> and <i>Musa balbisiana</i>. While the original wild bananas contained large seeds, <!--del_lnk--> diploid or <!--del_lnk--> polyploid cultivars (some being <!--del_lnk--> hybrids) with tiny seeds are preferred for human raw fruit consumption. These are propagated <!--del_lnk--> asexually from offshoots. The plant is allowed to produce two shoots at a time; a larger one for immediate fruiting and a smaller "sucker" or "follower" to produce fruit in 6&ndash;8 months. The life of a banana plantation is 25 years or longer, during which time the individual stools or planting sites may move slightly from their original positions as lateral <!--del_lnk--> rhizome formation dictates.</p>
       <p>Cultivated bananas are <!--del_lnk--> parthenocarpic, i.e. the flesh of the fruit swells and ripens without its seeds being fertilized and developing. Lacking viable seeds, propagation typically involves farmers removing and transplanting part of the underground stem (called a corm). Usually this is done by carefully removing a sucker (a vertical shoot that develops from the base of the banana pseudostem) with some roots intact. However, small <!--del_lnk--> sympodial corms, representing not yet elongated suckers, are easier to transplant and can be left out of the ground for up to two weeks; they require minimal care and can be shipped in bulk.</p>
       <p>It is not necessary to include the corm or root structure to propagate bananas; severed suckers without root material can be propagated in damp <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">sand</a>, although this takes somewhat longer.</p>
       <p>In some countries, commercial propagation occurs by means of <!--del_lnk--> tissue culture. This method is preferred since it ensures disease-free planting material. When using vegetative parts such as suckers for propagation, there is a risk of transmitting diseases (especially the devastating <!--del_lnk--> Panama disease).</p>
       <p>As a non-seasonal crop, bananas are available fresh year-round.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In global commerce, by far the most important cultivars belong to the triploid <!--del_lnk--> AAA <!--del_lnk--> group of <i>Musa acuminata</i>, commonly referred to as Cavendish group bananas. They account for the majority of banana exports, despite only coming into existence in 1836. The cultivars <!--del_lnk--> Dwarf Cavendish and <!--del_lnk--> Grand Nain (Chiquita Banana) gained popularity in the 1950s after the previous mass-produced cultivar, <!--del_lnk--> Gros Michel (also an AAA group cultivar), became commercially unviable due to <!--del_lnk--> Panama disease, caused by the fungus <i><!--del_lnk--> Fusarium oxysporum</i> which attacks the roots of the banana plant.</p>
       <p>Ease of transport and shelf life rather than superior taste make the Dwarf Cavendish the main export banana.</p>
       <p>Even though it is no longer viable for large scale cultivation, Gros Michel is not extinct and is still grown in areas where Panama disease is not found. Likewise, Dwarf Cavendish and Grand Nain are in no danger of extinction, but they may leave supermarket shelves if disease makes it impossible to supply the global market. It is unclear if any existing cultivar can replace Cavendish bananas, so various <!--del_lnk--> hybridisation and <!--del_lnk--> genetic engineering programs are attempting to create a disease-resistant, mass-market banana.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ripening">Ripening</span></h3>
       <p>Export bananas are picked green, and ripen in special rooms upon arrival in the destination country. These rooms are air-tight and filled with <a href="../../wp/e/Ethylene.htm" title="Ethylene">ethylene</a> gas to induce ripening. The vivid yellow colour normally associated with <!--del_lnk--> supermarket bananas is in fact a side effect of the artificial ripening process. Flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature. Bananas are refrigerated to between 13.5 and 15 &deg;C (56&nbsp;and 59&nbsp;&deg;F) during transport. At lower temperatures, ripening permanently stalls, and turns the bananas gray as cell walls break down. The skin of ripe bananas quickly blackens in the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">4 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(39&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> environment of a domestic <!--del_lnk--> refrigerator, although the fruit inside remains unaffected.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>"Tree-ripened" Cavendish bananas have a greenish-yellow appearance which changes to a brownish-yellow as they ripen further. Although both flavor and texture of tree-ripened bananas is generally regarded as superior to any type of green-picked fruit, this reduces shelf life to only 7&ndash;10 days.</p>
       <p>Bananas can be ordered by the retailer "ungassed", and may show up at the supermarket fully green. "<!--del_lnk--> Guineo Verde", or green bananas that have not been gassed will never fully ripen before becoming rotten. Instead of fresh eating, these bananas are best suited to cooking, as seen in Mexican culinary dishes.</p>
       <p>A 2008 study reported that ripe bananas <!--del_lnk--> fluoresce when exposed to <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light. This property is attributed to the degradation of <!--del_lnk--> chlorophyll leading to the accumulation of a fluorescent product in the skin of the fruit. The chlorophyll <!--del_lnk--> breakdown product is stabilized by a <!--del_lnk--> propionate <!--del_lnk--> ester group. Banana-plant leaves also fluoresce in the same way. Green bananas do not fluoresce. The study suggested that this allows animals which can see light in the ultraviolet spectrum (<!--del_lnk--> tetrachromats and <!--del_lnk--> pentachromats) to more easily detect ripened bananas.<br style="clear:both;" />
       </p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Storage_and_transport">Storage and transport</span></h3>
       <p>Bananas must be transported over long distances from the tropics to world markets. To obtain maximum shelf life, harvest comes before the fruit is mature. The fruit requires careful handling, rapid transport to ports, cooling, and refrigerated shipping. The goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent, ethylene. This technology allows storage and transport for 3&ndash;4 weeks at <span style="white-space:nowrap;">13 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(55&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>. On arrival, bananas are held at about <span style="white-space:nowrap;">17 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(63&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> and treated with a low concentration of ethylene. After a few days, the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale. Unripe bananas can not be held in home refrigerators because they suffer from the cold. Ripe bananas can be held for a few days at home. If bananas are too green, they can be put in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight to speed up the ripening process.</p>
       <p>Carbon dioxide (which bananas produce) and ethylene absorbents extend fruit life even at high temperatures. This effect can be exploited by packing banana in a <!--del_lnk--> polyethylene bag and including an ethylene absorbent, e.g., <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium_permanganate.htm" title="Potassium permanganate">potassium permanganate</a>, on an inert carrier. The bag is then sealed with a band or string. This treatment has been shown to more than double lifespans up to 3&ndash;4 weeks without the need for refrigeration.</p>

       <p>Statistics on the production and export of bananas and plantains are available from the <!--del_lnk--> Food and Agriculture Organization. Some countries produce statistics which distinguish between bananas and plantains, but three of the top four producers (<a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>) do not, so comparisons can only be made using the total for bananas and plantains combined. The 2011 statistics (see Table 1) show that India led the world in banana production, producing around 20% of the worldwide crop of 145&nbsp;million metric tonnes. <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> was the next largest producer with around 8% of the worldwide crop. Its national data does distinguish between bananas and plantains, and shows that the latter made up over 95% of production. Ten countries produced around two thirds of the total world production.</p>
       <p>The statistics for the export of bananas and plantains show a rather different picture (see Table 2). Total world exports at around 18&nbsp;million metric tonnes amounted to only 12% of total world production; two thirds of the exports were generated by only five countries. The top three producing countries do not appear in this table, and two countries, <a href="../../wp/c/Costa_Rica.htm" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Guatemala.htm" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, do not appear in the table of top producers. Only the Philippines has a consistent position in both tables. Exports were dominated by <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, with 29% of the world total. Statistics for Ecuador distinguish between bananas and plantains; 93% of its exports were classified as bananas.</p>
       <p>Bananas and plantains constitute a major staple <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">food crop</a> for millions of people in <!--del_lnk--> developing countries. In most tropical countries, green (unripe) bananas used for <!--del_lnk--> cooking represent the main cultivars. Bananas are cooked in ways that are similar to <a href="../../wp/p/Potato.htm" title="Potato">potatoes</a>. Both can be <!--del_lnk--> fried, <!--del_lnk--> boiled, <!--del_lnk--> baked, or chipped and have similar <!--del_lnk--> taste and texture when served. One banana provides about the same <!--del_lnk--> calories as one potato.</p>
       <p>Most producers are small-scale <!--del_lnk--> farmers either for home consumption or local markets. Because bananas and plantains produce fruit year-round, they provide an extremely valuable food source during the <i>hunger season</i> (when the food from one annual/semi-annual harvest has been consumed, and the next is still to come). Bananas and plantains are therefore critical to global <!--del_lnk--> food security.</p>
       <p>Bananas have been an important source of disagreement in the Doha Round of trade talks. A study for <!--del_lnk--> ICTSD showed that the new deal on EU banana import tariffs will be a boon to <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin American">Latin American</a> exporters but would trigger a drop in exports of the fruit from African, Caribbean and Pacific (<!--del_lnk--> ACP) countries.</p>
       <p>Bananas are among the most widely consumed foods in the world. Most banana farmers receive a low price for their produce as <!--del_lnk--> grocery companies pay discounted prices for buying in enormous quantity. Price competition among grocers has reduced their margins, leading to lower prices for growers. <!--del_lnk--> Chiquita, <!--del_lnk--> Del Monte, <!--del_lnk--> Dole, and <!--del_lnk--> Fyffes grow their own bananas in Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, <a href="../../wp/g/Guatemala.htm" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, and <a href="../../wp/h/Honduras.htm" title="Honduras">Honduras</a>. Banana plantations are capital intensive and demand significant expertise. The majority of independent growers are large and wealthy landowners in these countries. Producers have attempted to raise prices via marketing them as "<!--del_lnk--> fair trade" or <!--del_lnk--> Rainforest Alliance-certified in some countries.</p>
       <p>The banana has an extensive trade history starting with firms such as <!--del_lnk--> Fyffes and the <!--del_lnk--> United Fruit Company (now Chiquita) at the end of the 19th century. For much of the 20th century, bananas and <a href="../../wp/c/Coffee.htm" title="Coffee">coffee</a> dominated the export economies of <a href="../../wp/c/Central_America.htm" title="Central America">Central America</a>. In the 1930s, bananas and <a href="../../wp/c/Coffee.htm" title="Coffee">coffee</a> made up as much as 75% of the region's exports. As late as 1960, the two crops accounted for 67% of the exports from the region. Though the two were grown in similar regions, they tended not to be distributed together. The <!--del_lnk--> United Fruit Company based its business almost entirely on the banana trade, because the coffee trade proved too difficult to control. The term "<!--del_lnk--> banana republic" has been applied to most countries in <a href="../../wp/c/Central_America.htm" title="Central America">Central America</a>, but from a strict economic perspective only Costa Rica, Honduras, and <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a> had economies dominated by the banana trade.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> has traditionally imported many of their bananas from former European <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean colonies, paying guaranteed prices above global market rates (see <!--del_lnk--> Lom&eacute; Convention) As of 2005, these arrangements were in the process of being withdrawn under pressure from other major trading powers, principally the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. The withdrawal of these indirect subsidies to Caribbean producers is expected to favour the banana producers of Central America, in which American companies have an economic interest.</p>
       <p>The United States produces few bananas. A mere 14,000 tonnes (14,000 long tons; 15,000 short tons) were grown in Hawaii in 2001. Bananas were once grown in <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> and southern California.</p>

       <p>While in no danger of outright extinction, the most common edible banana cultivar Cavendish (extremely popular in Europe and the Americas) could become unviable for large-scale cultivation in the next 10&ndash;20 years. Its predecessor '<!--del_lnk--> Gros Michel', discovered in the 1820s, suffered this fate. Like almost all bananas, Cavendish lacks genetic diversity, which makes it vulnerable to diseases, threatening both commercial cultivation and small-scale subsistence farming. Some commentators remarked that those variants which could replace what much of the world considers a "typical banana" are so different that most people would not consider them the same fruit, and blame the decline of the banana on <!--del_lnk--> monogenetic cultivation driven by short-term commercial motives.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Panama_disease">Panama disease</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Panama disease is caused by a <!--del_lnk--> fusarium soil <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungus</a> (Race 1), which enters the plants through the roots and travels with water into the trunk and leaves, producing <!--del_lnk--> gels and gums that cut off the flow of water and nutrients, causing the plant to <!--del_lnk--> wilt, and exposing the rest of the plant to lethal amounts of sunlight. Prior to 1960, almost all commercial banana production centered on "Gros Michel", which was highly susceptible. Cavendish was chosen as the replacement for Gros Michel because, among resistant cultivars, it produces the highest quality <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruit</a>. However, more care is required for shipping the Cavendish, and its quality compared to Gros Michel is debated.</p>
       <p>According to current sources, a deadly form of Panama disease is infecting Cavendish. All plants are genetically identical, which prevents evolution of disease resistance. Researchers are examining hundreds of wild varieties for resistance.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tropical_Race_4">Tropical Race 4</span></h4>
       <p>TR4 is a reinvigorated strain of Panama disease first discovered in 1993. This virulent form of fusarium wilt has wiped out Cavendish in several southeast Asian countries. It has yet to reach the Americas; however, soil fungi can easily be carried on boots, clothing, or tools. This is how Tropical Race 4 travels and is its most likely route into Latin America. Cavendish is highly susceptible to TR4, and over time, Cavendish is almost certain to disappear from commercial production by this disease. Unfortunately, the only known defense to TR4 is genetic resistance.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Black_Sigatoka">Black Sigatoka</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Black sigatoka is a fungal leaf spot disease first observed in <a href="../../wp/f/Fiji.htm" title="Fiji">Fiji</a> in 1963 or 1964. Black Sigatoka (also known as black leaf streak) has spread to banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves that were used as packing material. It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains, impeding <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> by blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf. Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do grow <!--del_lnk--> ripen prematurely, making them unsuitable for export. The fungus has shown ever-increasing resistance to treatment, with the current expense for treating 1 hectare (2.5&nbsp;acres) exceeding <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>1,000 per year. In addition to the expense, there is the question of how long intensive spraying can be environmentally justified. Several resistant cultivars of banana have been developed, but none has yet received commercial acceptance due to taste and texture issues.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="In_East_Africa">In East Africa</span></h4>
       <p>With the arrival of <!--del_lnk--> Black sigatoka, banana production in eastern Africa fell by over 40%. For example, during the 1970s, Uganda produced 15 to 20 tonnes (15 to 20 long tons; 17 to 22 short tons) of bananas per hectare. Today, production has fallen to only 6 tonnes (5.9&nbsp;long tons; 6.6&nbsp;short tons) per hectare.</p>
       <p>The situation has started to improve as new disease-resistant cultivars have been developed by the <!--del_lnk--> International Institute of Tropical Agriculture and the National Agricultural Research Organisation of Uganda (NARO), such as FHIA-17 (known in <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> as the <!--del_lnk--> Kabana 3). These new cultivars taste different from the Cabana banana, which has slowed their acceptance by local farmers. However, by adding <!--del_lnk--> mulch and <!--del_lnk--> manure to the soil around the base of the plant, these new cultivars have substantially increased yields in the areas where they have been tried.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> International Institute of Tropical Agriculture and NARO, funded by the <!--del_lnk--> Rockefeller Foundation and <!--del_lnk--> CGIAR have started trials for <!--del_lnk--> genetically modified bananas that are resistant to both Black sigatoka and banana weevils. It is developing cultivars specifically for smallholder and subsistence farmers.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Banana_Bunchy_Top_Virus_.28BBTV.29">Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV)</span></h3>
       <p>This <a href="../../wp/v/Virus.htm" title="Virus">virus</a> jumps from plant to plant using <a href="../../wp/a/Aphid.htm" title="Aphid">aphids</a>. It stunts leaves, resulting in a "bunched" appearance. Generally, an infected plant does not produce fruit, although mild strains exist which allow some production. These mild strains are often mistaken for malnourishment, or a disease other than BBTV. There is no cure; however, its effect can be minimized by planting only <!--del_lnk--> tissue-cultured plants (in vitro propagation), controlling aphids, and immediately removing and destroying infected plants.</p>

       <p>Bananas are a staple <!--del_lnk--> starch for many <a href="../../wp/t/Tropics.htm" title="Tropics">tropical</a> populations. Depending upon cultivar and ripeness, the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet, and texture from firm to mushy. Both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. The banana's flavor is due, amongst other chemicals, to <!--del_lnk--> isoamyl acetate which is one of the main constituents of <!--del_lnk--> banana oil.</p>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> ripening process, bananas produce a <!--del_lnk--> plant hormone called <a href="../../wp/e/Ethylene.htm" title="Ethylene">ethylene</a>, which indirectly affects the flavor. Among other things, ethylene stimulates the formation of <!--del_lnk--> amylase, an <!--del_lnk--> enzyme that breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste of bananas. The greener, less ripe bananas contain higher levels of starch and, consequently, have a "starchier" taste. On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations. Furthermore, ethylene signals the production of <!--del_lnk--> pectinase, an enzyme which breaks down the <!--del_lnk--> pectin between the cells of the banana, causing the banana to soften as it ripens.</p>
       <p>Bananas are eaten deep fried, baked in their skin in a split <!--del_lnk--> bamboo, or steamed in <!--del_lnk--> glutinous rice wrapped in a banana leaf. Bananas can be made into <!--del_lnk--> jam. Banana <!--del_lnk--> pancakes are popular amongst <!--del_lnk--> backpackers and other travelers in <!--del_lnk--> South Asia and <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia. This has elicited the expression <i><!--del_lnk--> Banana Pancake Trail</i> for those places in <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> that cater to this group of travelers. <!--del_lnk--> Banana chips are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain, which have a dark brown colour and an intense banana taste. Dried bananas are also ground to make banana flour. Extracting juice is difficult, because when a banana is compressed, it simply turns to pulp. Bananas feature prominently in <!--del_lnk--> Philippine cuisine, being part of traditional dishes and desserts like <i><!--del_lnk--> maruya</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> turr&oacute;n</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> halo-halo</i>. Most of these dishes use the <!--del_lnk--> Saba or Cardaba banana cultivar. <!--del_lnk--> Pisang goreng, bananas fried with batter similar to the Filipino <i>maruya</i>, is a popular dessert in <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>.

       <p>The banana plant has long been a source of <!--del_lnk--> fibre for high quality <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textiles</a>. In <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, banana cultivation for clothing and household use dates back to at least the 13th century. In the Japanese system, leaves and shoots are cut from the plant periodically to ensure softness. Harvested shoots are first boiled in <!--del_lnk--> lye to prepare fibers for <!--del_lnk--> yarn-making. These banana shoots produce fibers of varying degrees of softness, yielding yarns and textiles with differing qualities for specific uses. For example, the outermost fibers of the shoots are the coarsest, and are suitable for <!--del_lnk--> tablecloths, while the softest innermost fibers are desirable for <!--del_lnk--> kimono and <!--del_lnk--> kamishimo. This traditional Japanese cloth-making process requires many steps, all performed by hand.</p>
       <p>In a <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepalese</a> system the trunk is harvested instead, and small pieces are subjected to a softening process, mechanical fibre extraction, bleaching and drying.
