       <p><b>Bruce Lee</b> (born <b>Lee Jun-fan</b>; 27 November 1940 &ndash; 20 July 1973) was a <!--del_lnk--> Chinese American and <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong actor, <!--del_lnk--> martial arts instructor, <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosopher</a>, <!--del_lnk--> film director, <!--del_lnk--> film producer, <!--del_lnk--> screenwriter, and founder of the <!--del_lnk--> Jeet Kune Do martial arts movement. He is considered one of the most influential martial artists of the 20th century, and a <!--del_lnk--> cultural icon.</p>
       <p>Lee was born in San Francisco, California in the United States, to parents of <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong heritage but raised in Hong Kong until his late teens. Upon reaching the age of 18, Lee emigrated to the United States to claim his U.S. Citizenship and receive his higher education. It was during this time he began teaching martial arts, which soon led to film and television roles.</p>
       <p>His <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, and sparked a major surge of interest in <!--del_lnk--> Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films changed and influenced martial arts and <!--del_lnk--> martial arts films in Hong Kong and the rest of the world as well. He is noted for his roles in five feature-length films, <!--del_lnk--> Lo Wei's <i><!--del_lnk--> The Big Boss</i> (1971) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Fist of Fury</i> (1972); <i><!--del_lnk--> Way of the Dragon</i> (1972), directed and written by Lee; <!--del_lnk--> Warner Brothers' <i><!--del_lnk--> Enter the Dragon</i> (1973), directed by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Clouse; and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Game of Death</i> (1978), directed by Robert Clouse posthumously.</p>
       <p>Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, as he portrayed <!--del_lnk--> Chinese nationalism in his films. While Lee initially trained in <!--del_lnk--> Wing Chun, he later rejected well-defined martial art styles, favouring instead to utilise useful techniques from various sources in the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy he dubbed <!--del_lnk--> Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist).</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
       <p>Lee was born on 27 November 1940 at the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Hospital in <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown, San Francisco. His father, <!--del_lnk--> Lee Hoi-chuen, was Chinese, and his mother Grace Ho (&#x4F55;&#x611B;&#x745C;), a Catholic, was of German and Chinese ancestry. Lee was the fourth child of five children: Agnes, Phoebe, Peter, and <!--del_lnk--> Robert. Lee and his parents returned to Hong Kong when he was three months old.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Names">Names</span></h3>
       <p>Lee's <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese birth name was <i><!--del_lnk--> Lee Jun-fan</i> (&#x674E;&#x632F;&#x85E9;). The name literally means "return again"; it was given to Lee by his mother, who felt he would return to the United States once he came to of age. Because of his mother's superstitious nature, she originally named him <i>Sai-fon</i> (&#x7D30;&#x9CF3;), which is a feminine name means "small phoenix". The English name "Bruce" was thought to be given by the hospital attending physician, Dr. Mary Glover.</p>
       <p>Lee had three other Chinese names: <b>Li Yuanxin</b> (&#x674E;&#x6E90;&#x946B;), a family/clan name; <b>Li Yuanjian</b> (&#x674E;&#x5143;&#x9452;), as a student name while he was attending <!--del_lnk--> La Salle College, and his Chinese screen name <b>Li Xiaolong</b> (&#x674E;&#x5C0F;&#x9F8D;; <i>Xiaolong</i> means "little dragon"). Lee's given name <b>Jun-fan</b> was originally written in Chinese as &#x9707;&#x85E9;, however, the <i>Jun</i> (&#x9707;) <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Chinese_characters.htm" title="Chinese character">Chinese character</a> was identical to part of his grandfather's name, Lee Jun-biu (&#x674E;&#x9707;&#x5F6A;). Hence, the Chinese character for <i>Jun</i> in Lee's name was changed to the <!--del_lnk--> homonym &#x632F; instead, to avoid <!--del_lnk--> naming taboo in Chinese tradition.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Family">Family</span></h3>
       <p>Lee's father, <!--del_lnk--> Lee Hoi-chuen, was one of the leading <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese opera and film actors at the time, and was embarking on a year-long Cantonese opera tour with his family on the eve of the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing at numerous Chinese communities there.</p>
       <p>Although a number of his peers decided to stay in the United States, Lee Hoi-chuen decided to go back to Hong Kong after his wife gave birth to Bruce Lee. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under <!--del_lnk--> Japanese occupation. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong's rebuilding years.</p>
       <p>Lee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the niece of <!--del_lnk--> Sir Robert Ho-tung, patriarch of the clan. As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. Despite this advantage of his family's status and because of the mass number of people fleeing <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="People's Republic of China">communist China</a> to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong neighbourhood Lee grew up in became over-crowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">Post-war Hong Kong was a tough place to grow up. Gangs ruled the city streets and Lee was often forced to fight them. But Bruce liked a challenge and faced his adversaries head on. To his parents dismay, Bruce's street fighting continued and the violent nature of his confrontations was escalating.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>After being involved in several street fights, Lee's parents decided that he needed to be trained in the martial arts. Lee's first introduction to martial arts was through his father. He learned the fundamentals of <!--del_lnk--> Wu style tai chi chuan from his father.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wing_Chun">Wing Chun</span></h3>
       <p>The largest influence on Lee's martial arts development was his study of <!--del_lnk--> Wing Chun. Lee began training in Wing Chun at the age of 13 under the Wing Chun teacher <!--del_lnk--> Yip Man in 1954, after losing a fight with rival gang members. Yip's regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice, <i>chi sao</i> (sticking hands) drills, <!--del_lnk--> wooden dummy techniques, and free-sparring. There was no set pattern to the classes. Yip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organised competitions.</p>
       <p>After a year into his Wing Chun training, most of Yip Man's other students refused to train with Lee after they learnt of his ancestry (his mother was of half-German ancestry) as the Chinese generally were against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians. Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung states, "Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Yip Man". However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun, and continued to train privately with <!--del_lnk--> Yip Man and <!--del_lnk--> Wong Shun Leung in 1955.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Leaving_Hong_Kong">Leaving Hong Kong</span></h3>
       <p>After attending Tak Sun School (&#x5FB7;&#x4FE1;&#x5B78;&#x6821;) (a couple of blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, <!--del_lnk--> Kowloon), Lee entered the primary school division of <!--del_lnk--> La Salle College in 1950 or 1952 (at the age of 12). In around 1956, due to poor academic performance (or possibly poor conduct as well), he was transferred to <!--del_lnk--> St. Francis Xavier's College (high school) where he would be mentored by Brother Edward, a <!--del_lnk--> Catholic monk (originally from Germany spending his entire adult life in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="People's Republic of China">China</a> and then Hong Kong), teacher, and coach of the school boxing team.</p>
       <p>In the spring of 1959, Lee got into yet another street fight and the police were called. From all the way to his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating up the son of a feared <!--del_lnk--> triad family. Eventually, Lee's father decided for him to leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier avenue in the United States. His parents confirmed the police's fear that this time Lee's opponent had an <!--del_lnk--> organised crime background, and there was the possibility that a contract was out for his life.</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">The police detective came and he says "Excuse me Mr. Lee, your son is really fighting bad in school. If he gets into just one more fight I might have to put him in jail".</div>
        <div class="templatequotecite">&mdash;Robert Lee</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In April 1959, Lee's parents decided to send him to the United States to meet up with his older sister Agnes Lee (&#x674E;&#x79CB;&#x9CF3;), who was already living with family friends in San Francisco.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="New_life_in_America">New life in America</span></h2>
       <p>At the age of 18, Lee returned to the United States with $100 in his pocket and the titles of 1957 High School Boxing Champion and 1958 <!--del_lnk--> Crown colony <!--del_lnk--> Cha Cha Champion of Hong Kong. After living in San Francisco for several months, he moved to <a href="../../wp/s/Seattle.htm" title="Seattle">Seattle</a> in 1959, to continue his high school education, where he also worked for <!--del_lnk--> Ruby Chow as a live-in waiter at her restaurant.</p>
       <p>Chow's husband was a co-worker and friend of Lee's father. Lee's older brother Peter Lee (&#x674E;&#x5FE0;&#x741B;) would also join him in Seattle for a short stay before moving on to <a href="../../wp/m/Minnesota.htm" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> to attend college. In December 1960, Lee completed his high school education and received his diploma from Edison Technical School (now <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Central Community College, located on <!--del_lnk--> Capitol Hill, Seattle).</p>
       <p>In March 1961, Lee enrolled at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Washington, majoring in drama according to the university's alumni association information, not in <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> as claimed by Lee himself and many others. Lee also studied philosophy, <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, and various other subjects. It was at the University of Washington that he met his future wife <!--del_lnk--> Linda Emery, a fellow student studying to become a teacher, whom he married in August 1964.</p>
       <p>Lee had two children with Linda Emery, <!--del_lnk--> Brandon Lee (1965&ndash;1993) and <!--del_lnk--> Shannon Lee (b. 1969).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Jun_Fan_Gung_Fu">Jun Fan Gung Fu</span></h3>
       <p>Lee began teaching martial arts in the United States in 1959. He called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu (literally Bruce Lee's Kung Fu). It was basically his approach to <!--del_lnk--> Wing Chun. Lee taught friends he met in Seattle, starting with <a href="../../wp/j/Judo.htm" title="Judo">Judo</a> practitioner <!--del_lnk--> Jesse Glover, who later became his first assistant instructor. Lee opened his first martial arts school, named the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute, in Seattle.</p>
       <p>Lee dropped out of college in the spring of 1964 and moved to <!--del_lnk--> Oakland to live with <!--del_lnk--> James Yimm Lee (&#x56B4;&#x93E1;&#x6D77;). James Lee was twenty years senior to Bruce Lee and a well known Chinese martial artist in the area. Together, they founded the second Jun Fan martial art studio in Oakland. James Lee was also responsible for introducing Bruce Lee to <!--del_lnk--> Ed Parker, royalty of the U.S. martial arts world and organiser of the <!--del_lnk--> Long Beach International Karate Championships at which Bruce Lee was later "discovered" by Hollywood.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Jeet Kune Do originated in 1967. After taping one season of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Green Hornet</i>, Lee found himself out of work and opened The Jun Fan Institute of Gung Fu. A controversial match with <!--del_lnk--> Wong Jack Man influenced Lee's philosophy about martial arts. Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his <!--del_lnk--> Wing Chun techniques. He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalistic to be practical in scenarios of chaotic <!--del_lnk--> street fighting. Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on "practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency". He started to use different methods of training such as <a href="../../wp/w/Weight_training.htm" title="Weight training">weight training</a> for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques.</p>
       <p>Lee emphasised what he called "the style of no style". This consisted of getting rid of the formalised approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles. Lee felt the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was even too restrictive, and eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call <i>Jeet Kune Do</i> or the <i>Way of the Intercepting Fist.</i> It is a term he would later regret because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Long_Beach_International_Karate_Championships">Long Beach International Karate Championships</span></h3>
       <p>At the invitation of <!--del_lnk--> Ed Parker, Lee appeared in the 1964 <!--del_lnk--> Long Beach International Karate Championships and performed repetitions of two-finger <!--del_lnk--> pushups (using the thumb and the index finger of one hand) with feet at approximately a shoulder-width apart. In the same Long Beach event he also performed the "<!--del_lnk--> One inch punch", the description of which is as follows: Lee stood upright, his right foot forward with knees bent slightly, in front of a standing, stationary partner. Lee's right arm was partly extended and his right fist approximately an inch away from the partner's chest. Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to his partner while largely maintaining his posture, sending the partner backwards and falling into a chair said to be placed behind the partner to prevent injury, though his partner's momentum soon caused him to fall to the floor. His volunteer was Bob Baker of <!--del_lnk--> Stockton, California. "I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again", Baker recalled. "When he punched me that last time, I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable".</p>
       <p>It was at the 1964 championships where Lee first met <a href="../../wp/t/Taekwondo.htm" title="Taekwondo">Taekwondo</a> master <!--del_lnk--> Jhoon Goo Rhee. The two developed a friendship &mdash; a relationship from which they benefited as martial artists. Rhee taught Lee the <!--del_lnk--> side kick in detail, and Lee taught Rhee the "non-telegraphic" punch.</p>
       <p>Lee appeared at the 1967 <!--del_lnk--> Long Beach International Karate Championships and performed various demonstrations, including the famous "unstoppable punch" against USKA world <!--del_lnk--> Karate champion <!--del_lnk--> Vic Moore. Lee told Moore that he was going to throw a straight punch to the face, and all he had to do was to try and block it. Lee took several steps back and asked if Moore was ready, when Moore nodded in affirmation, Lee glided towards him until he was within striking range. He then threw a straight punch directly at Moore's face, and stopped before impact. In eight attempts, Moore failed to block any of the punches.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Lee's father <!--del_lnk--> Lee Hoi-chuen was a famous <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese opera star; because of this, Lee was introduced into films at a very young age and appeared in several short black-and-white films as a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage. By the time he was 18, he had appeared in twenty films.</p>
       <p>While in the United States from 1959&ndash;1964, Lee abandoned thoughts of a film career in favour of pursuing <!--del_lnk--> martial arts. However, a martial arts exhibition on Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by <!--del_lnk--> William Dozier for an audition for a part in the pilot for Number One Son. The show never aired, but Lee was invited for the role of <!--del_lnk--> Kato alongside <!--del_lnk--> Van Williams in the TV series <i><!--del_lnk--> The Green Hornet</i>. The show lasted just one season, from 1966 to 1967. Lee also played Kato in three crossover episodes of <i><!--del_lnk--> Batman</i>. This was followed by guest appearances in three television series: <i><!--del_lnk--> Ironside</i> (1967), <i><!--del_lnk--> Here Come the Brides</i> (1969), and <i>Blondie</i> (1969).</p>
       <p>At the time, two of Lee's martial arts students were Hollywood script writer <!--del_lnk--> Stirling Silliphant and actor <!--del_lnk--> James Coburn. In 1969 the three worked on a script for a film called The Silent Flute and went together on a location hunt to India. The project was not at realised at the time, but the 1978 film <!--del_lnk--> Circle of Iron starring David Carradine was based on the same plot. In 2010, producer Paul Maslansky was reported to plan and receive fundings for a film based on the original script for The Silent Flute. In 1969, Lee made a brief appearance in the Silliphant penned film <i><!--del_lnk--> Marlowe</i> where he played a henchman hired to intimidate private detective <!--del_lnk--> Philip Marlowe (played by <!--del_lnk--> James Garner) by smashing up his office with leaping kicks and flashing punches, only to later accidentally jump off a tall building while trying to kick Marlowe off. The same year he also choreographed fight scenes for <i><!--del_lnk--> The Wrecking Crew</i> starring <!--del_lnk--> Dean Martin, <!--del_lnk--> Sharon Tate and featuring <!--del_lnk--> Chuck Norris in his first role. In 1970, he was responsible for fight choreography for <i><!--del_lnk--> A Walk in the Spring Rain</i> starring <!--del_lnk--> Ingrid Bergman and <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Quinn, again written by Silliphant. In 1971, Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Longstreet</i> written by Silliphant. Lee played the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet (played by <!--del_lnk--> James Franciscus), and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy was written into the script.</p>
       <p>According to statements made by Lee, and also by <!--del_lnk--> Linda Lee Cadwell after Lee's death, in 1971 Lee pitched a television series of his own tentatively titled <i>The Warrior</i>, discussions which were also confirmed by <!--del_lnk--> Warner Bros. According to Cadwell, however, Lee's concept was retooled and renamed <i><!--del_lnk--> Kung Fu</i>, but <!--del_lnk--> Warner Bros. gave Lee no credit. However, Warner Brothers had for some time been developing an identical concept, created by two writers and producers, Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander. According to these sources, the reason Lee was not cast was in part because of his ethnicity but more so because he had a thick accent. The role of the <!--del_lnk--> Shaolin monk in the <!--del_lnk--> Wild West, was eventually awarded to then non-martial artist <!--del_lnk--> David Carradine. In a 9 December 1971 television interview on <i><!--del_lnk--> The Pierre Berton Show</i>, Lee commented about Warner Brothers' attitudes towards casting in the series: "They think that business wise it is a risk. I don't blame them. If the situation were reversed, and an American star were to come to Hong Kong, and I was the man with the money, I would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there".</p>
       <p>Producer Fred Weintraub had adviced Lee to return to Hong Kong and make a feature film which he could showcase to executives in Hollywood. Not happy with his supporting roles in the United States., Lee returned to Hong Kong. Unaware that <i><!--del_lnk--> The Green Hornet</i> had been played to success in Hong Kong and was unofficially referred to as "The Kato Show", he was surprised to be recognised on the street as the star of the show. After negotiating with both <!--del_lnk--> Shaw Brothers Studio and <!--del_lnk--> Golden Harvest, Lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced by Golden Harvest. Lee played his first leading role in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Big Boss</i> (1971) which proved to be an enormous box office success across Asia and catapulted him to stardom. He soon followed up with <i><!--del_lnk--> Fist of Fury</i> (1972) which broke the box office records set previously by <i>The Big Boss</i>. Having finished his initial two-year contract, Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company Concord Productions Inc. (&#x5354;&#x548C;&#x96FB;&#x5F71;&#x516C;&#x53F8;) with Chow. For his third film, <i><!--del_lnk--> Way of the Dragon</i> (1972), he was given complete control of the film's production as the writer, director, star, and <!--del_lnk--> choreographer of the fight scenes. In 1964, at a demonstration in <!--del_lnk--> Long Beach, California, Lee had met <!--del_lnk--> Karate champion <!--del_lnk--> Chuck Norris. In <i>Way of the Dragon</i> Lee introduced Norris to moviegoers as his opponent in the final death fight at the <a href="../../wp/c/Colosseum.htm" title="Colosseum">Colosseum</a> in Rome, today considered one of Lee's most legendary fight scenes and one of the most memorable fight scenes in <!--del_lnk--> martial arts film history. The role was originally offered to American Karate champion <!--del_lnk--> Joe Lewis.</p>
       <p>In late 1972, Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest Film, <i><!--del_lnk--> Game of Death</i>. He began filming some scenes including his fight sequence with 7'2" American Basketball star <!--del_lnk--> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a former student. Production was stopped when Warner Brothers offered Lee the opportunity to star in <i><!--del_lnk--> Enter the Dragon</i>, the first film to be produced jointly by Golden Harvest and Warner Bros. Filming commenced in Hong Kong in February 1973. One month into the filming, another production company promoted Bruce Lee as a leading actor in <i>Fist of Unicorn</i>, although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favour to his long-time friend <!--del_lnk--> Unicorn Chan. Lee planned to sue the production company, but retained his friendship with Chan. However, only a few months after the completion of <i>Enter the Dragon</i>, and six days before its 26 July 1973 release, Lee died. <i>Enter the Dragon</i> would go on to become one of the year's highest grossing films and cement Lee as a martial arts legend. It was made for US$850,000 in 1973 (equivalent to $4&nbsp;million adjusted for inflation as of 2007). To date, <i>Enter the Dragon</i> has grossed over $200&nbsp;million worldwide. The film sparked a brief <!--del_lnk--> fad in martial arts, epitomised in songs such as "<!--del_lnk--> Kung Fu Fighting" and TV shows like <i><!--del_lnk--> Kung Fu</i>.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Robert Clouse, the director of <i>Enter the Dragon</i>, and Raymond Chow attempted to finish Lee's incomplete film <i>Game of Death</i> which Lee was also set to write and direct. Lee had shot over 100 minutes of footage, including out-takes, for <i>Game of Death</i> before shooting was stopped to allow him to work on <i>Enter the Dragon</i>. In addition to <!--del_lnk--> Abdul-Jabbar, <!--del_lnk--> George Lazenby, Hapkido master <!--del_lnk--> Ji Han-Jae and another of Lee's students, <!--del_lnk--> Dan Inosanto were also to appear in the film, which was to culminate in Lee's character, Hai Tien (clad in the now-famous yellow track suit) taking on a series of different challenge on each floor as they make their way through a five-level pagoda. In a controversial move, Robert Clouse finished the film using a <!--del_lnk--> look-alike and <!--del_lnk--> archive footage of Lee from his other films with a new storyline and cast, which was released in 1978. However, the cobbled-together film contained only fifteen minutes of actual footage of Lee (he had printed many unsuccessful takes) while the rest had a Lee look-alike, <!--del_lnk--> Kim Tai Chung, and <!--del_lnk--> Yuen Biao as stunt double. The unused footage Lee had filmed was recovered 22 years later and included in the documentary <i><!--del_lnk--> Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey</i>.</p>
       <p>Apart from <i><!--del_lnk--> Game of Death</i>, other future film projects were planned to feature Lee at the time. In 1972, after the success of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Big Boss</i> and <i>[[Fist of Fury]</i>, a third film was planned by <!--del_lnk--> Raymond Chow at <!--del_lnk--> Golden Harvest to be directed by <!--del_lnk--> Lo Wei, titled <i>Yellow-Faced Tiger</i>. However, at the time, Lee decided to direct and produce his own script for <i><!--del_lnk--> Way of the Dragon</i> instead. Although Lee had formed a production company with Raymond Chow, a period film was also planned from September&ndash;November 1973 with the competing <!--del_lnk--> Shaw Brothers Studio, to be directed by either <!--del_lnk--> Chor Yuen or Cheng Kang, and written by Yi Kang and <!--del_lnk--> Chang Cheh, titled <i>The Seven Sons of the Jade Dragon</i>. Lee had also worked on several scripts himself. A tape containing a recording of Lee narrating the basic storyline to a film tentatively titled <i>Southern Fist/Northern Leg</i> exists, showing some similarities with the canned script for The Silent Flute (<i><!--del_lnk--> Circle of Iron</i>). Another script had the title <i>Green Bamboo Warrior</i>, set in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco.htm" title="San Fransisco">San Fransisco</a>, planned to co-star <!--del_lnk--> Bolo Yeung and to be produced by <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Vajna who later went on to produce <!--del_lnk--> First Blood. Photo shoot costume tests were also organized for some of these plannned film projects.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_fitness">Physical fitness</span></h3>
       <p>Lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigorous, dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as he possibly could.</p>
       <p>After his match with <!--del_lnk--> Wong Jack Man in 1965, Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training. Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included all elements of total fitness&mdash;muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. He tried traditional <!--del_lnk--> bodybuilding techniques to build bulky muscles or mass. However, Lee was careful to admonish that mental and spiritual preparation was fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Tao of Jeet Kune Do</i>, he wrote</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation. ... JKD, ultimately is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/w/Weight_training.htm" title="Weight training">weight training</a> program that Lee used during a stay in Hong Kong in 1965 placed heavy emphasis on his arms. At that time he could perform single <!--del_lnk--> bicep curls at a weight of 70 to 80&nbsp;lb (about 32 to 36&nbsp;kg) for three sets of eight repetitions, along with other forms of exercises, such as <!--del_lnk--> squats, <!--del_lnk--> push-ups, reverse curls, concentration curls, <!--del_lnk--> French presses, and both wrist curls and reverse wrist curls. The repetitions he performed were 6 to 12 reps (at the time). While this method of training targeted his fast and slow twitch muscles, it later resulted in weight gain or muscle mass, placing Lee a little over 160&nbsp;lb (about 72&nbsp;kg). Lee was documented as having well over 2,500 books in his own personal library, and eventually concluded that "A stronger muscle, is a bigger muscle", a conclusion he later disputed. Bruce forever experimented with his training routines to maximise his physical abilities, and push the human body to its limits. He employed many different routines and exercises including <a href="../../wp/s/Skipping_rope.htm" title="Skipping rope">skipping rope</a>, which served his training and bodybuilding purposes effectively.</p>
       <p>Lee believed that the <!--del_lnk--> abdominal muscles were one of the most important muscle groups for a martial artist, since virtually every movement requires some degree of abdominal work. Mito Uyehara recalled that "Bruce always felt that if your stomach was not developed, then you had no business doing any hard sparring". According to <!--del_lnk--> Linda Lee Cadwell, even when not training, Lee would frequently perform <!--del_lnk--> sit ups and other <!--del_lnk--> abdominal exercises in domestic living throughout the day, such as during watching TV. She said of Lee, "Bruce was a fanatic about ab training. He was always doing sit-ups, <!--del_lnk--> crunches, <!--del_lnk--> Roman chair movements, leg raises and V-ups".</p>
       <p>Lee trained from 7&nbsp;am to 9&nbsp;am, including stomach, flexibility, and running, and from 11&nbsp;am to 12&nbsp;pm he would weight train and <!--del_lnk--> cycle. A typical exercise for Lee would be to run a distance of two to six miles in 15 to 45 minutes, in which he would vary speed in 3&ndash;5 minute intervals. Lee would ride the equivalent of 10 miles (about 16 kilometres) in 45 minutes on a stationary bike.</p>
       <p>Lee would sometimes exercise with the jump rope and put in 800 jumps after cycling. Lee would also do exercises to toughen the skin on his fists, including thrusting his hands into buckets of harsh rocks and gravel. He would do over 500 repetitions of this on a given day. An article of the S. China Post writes "When a doctor warned him not to inflict too much violence on his body, Bruce dismissed his words. 'the human brain can subjugate anything, even real pain' &mdash;Bruce Lee".</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_feats">Physical feats</span></h4>
       <p>Lee's phenomenal fitness meant he was capable of performing many exceptional physical feats. The following list includes some of the physical feats that are attributed to Bruce Lee.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Lee's striking speed from three feet with his hands down by his side reached five hundredths of a second.</li>
        <li>Lee could take in one arm a 75&nbsp;lb <!--del_lnk--> barbell from a standing position with the barbell held flush against his chest and slowly stick his arms out locking them, holding the barbell there for several seconds.</li>
        <li>In a speed demonstration, Lee could snatch a <!--del_lnk--> dime off a person's open palm before they could close it, and leave a <!--del_lnk--> penny behind.</li>
        <li>Lee would hold an elevated v-sit position for 30&nbsp;minutes or longer.</li>
        <li>Lee could throw grains of rice up into the air and then catch them in mid-flight using chopsticks.</li>
        <li>Lee performed one-hand <!--del_lnk--> push-ups using only the thumb and index finger.</li>
        <li>Lee performed 50 reps of one-arm <!--del_lnk--> chin-ups.</li>
        <li>Lee could cause a 300-lb (136.08&nbsp;kg) bag to fly towards and thump the ceiling with a <!--del_lnk--> sidekick.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nutrition">Nutrition</span></h3>
       <p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Linda Lee Cadwell, soon after he moved to the United States, Lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods, high-protein drinks and vitamin and mineral supplements. He later concluded that in order to achieve a high-performance body, one could not fuel it with a diet of junk food, and with "the wrong fuel" one's body would perform sluggishly or sloppily. Lee also avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them as providing calories which did nothing for his body.</p>
       <p>Lee consumed green vegetables and fruits every day. He always preferred to eat Chinese or other Asian food because he loved the variety that it had. Some of Lee's favourite Chinese dishes were beef in oyster sauce, tofu and steak and liver. He also became a heavy advocate of dietary supplements, including Vitamin C, Lecithin granules, bee pollen, Vitamin E, rose hips (liquid form), wheat germ oil, Acerola &mdash; C and B-Folia.</p>
       <p>Lee disliked dairy food although he knew that for building muscle he must add milk and consume eggs. As a result he only ate dairy as part of cereals and protein drinks, usually using powdered milk instead of fresh milk. Lee's diet included protein drinks; he always tried to consume one or two daily, but discontinued drinking them later on in his life. They typically included non-instant powdered milk which is reported to have a higher concentration of calcium than other forms of powdered milk, eggs, wheat germ, peanut butter, banana, brewers yeast for its B vitamins, and Inositol and Lecithin supplements. Linda Lee recalls Bruce Lee's waist fluctuated between 26 and 28&nbsp;inches (66 to 71 centimetres). <i>"He also drank his own juice concoctions made from vegetables and fruits, apples, celery, carrots and so on, prepared in an electric blender"</i>, she said.</p>
       <p>According to Lee, the size of portions and number of meals were just as important. He would usually consume four or five smaller meals a day rather than a couple of large meals, and would boost his <!--del_lnk--> metabolism by eating small healthy snacks such as fruits throughout the day. Fruit and vegetables provided him with the richest source of carbohydrates, he was particularly keen on carrots which would make up one half of the contents of the drink, with the remaining being split between the other fruits and vegetables. The reason why Lee was so keen on juicing vegetables and fruits is that he believed it allowed the body to assimilate many nutrients more easily. The enzymes in the juiced vegetables acting as organic <a href="../../wp/c/Catalysis.htm" title="Catalysis">catalysts</a> which increase the metabolism and absorption of nutrients. Given that most of these enzymes are destroyed when vegetables are cooked, Lee would try to consume them raw.</p>
       <p>Lee often drank a <!--del_lnk--> royal jelly and <!--del_lnk--> ginseng drink as they contain B-complex vitamins, including a high concentration of vitamin B<sub>5</sub> (<!--del_lnk--> pantothenic acid) and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (<!--del_lnk--> pyridoxine), <!--del_lnk--> acetylcholine, hormones, and eighteen <a href="../../wp/a/Amino_acid.htm" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a> which allow for a quick energy boost. In <!--del_lnk--> traditional Chinese medicine, ginseng is also said to improve circulation, increase blood supply, allow quicker recovery times after exhaustion and stimulating the body. In addition, Lee regularly drank black tea, often with honey or with <!--del_lnk--> milk and sugar.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophy">Philosophy</span></h2>
       <p>Although Lee is best known as a martial artist, he also studied drama and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> while a student at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Washington. He was well-read and had an extensive library. His own books on <!--del_lnk--> martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His <!--del_lnk--> eclectic philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings. He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge, and said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts. His influences include <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Jiddu Krishnamurti and <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. On the other hand, Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative world view advocated by Confucianism. John Little states that Lee was an <a href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheism">atheist</a>. When asked in 1972 what his religious affiliation was, he replied "none whatsoever". Also in 1972, when asked if he believed in God, he responded, "To be perfectly frank, I really do not".</p>
       <p>The following quotations reflect his fighting philosophy.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>"Be formless... shapeless, like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You pour water into a bottle; it becomes the bottle. You put water into a teapot; it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow, or creep or drip or crash! Be water, my friend..."</li>
        <li>"All types of knowledge, ultimately leads to self knowledge"</li>
        <li>"Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it".</li>
        <li>"Do not deny the classical approach, simply as a reaction, or you will have created another pattern and trapped yourself there".</li>
        <li>"Quick temper will make a fool of you soon enough".</li>
        <li>"I always learn something, and that is: to always be yourself. And to express yourself, to have faith in yourself. Do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate him".</li>
        <li>"It's not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential".</li>
       </ul>

       </div>
       <p>On 10 May 1973, Lee collapsed in <!--del_lnk--> Golden Harvest studios while doing dubbing work for the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Enter the Dragon</i>. Suffering from <!--del_lnk--> seizures and <a href="../../wp/h/Headache.htm" title="Headache">headaches</a>, he was immediately rushed to <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong Baptist Hospital where doctors diagnosed <!--del_lnk--> cerebral edema. They were able to reduce the swelling through the administration of <!--del_lnk--> mannitol. These same symptoms that occurred in his first collapse were later repeated on the day of his death.</p>
       <p>On 20 July 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong, to have dinner with former <a href="../../wp/j/James_Bond.htm" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> star <!--del_lnk--> George Lazenby, with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee's wife Linda, Lee met producer <!--del_lnk--> Raymond Chow at 2&nbsp;pm at home to discuss the making of the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Game of Death</i>. They worked until 4&nbsp;pm and then drove together to the home of Lee's colleague <!--del_lnk--> Betty Ting Pei, a <!--del_lnk--> Taiwanese actress. The three went over the script at Ting's home, and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.</p>
       <p>Later Lee complained of a headache, and Ting gave him an <a href="../../wp/a/Analgesic.htm" title="Analgesic">analgesic</a> (painkiller), <!--del_lnk--> Equagesic, which contained both <a href="../../wp/a/Aspirin.htm" title="Aspirin">aspirin</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> muscle relaxant <!--del_lnk--> meprobamate. Around 7:30&nbsp;pm, he went to lie down for a nap. When Lee did not turn up for dinner, Chow came to the apartment but could not wake Lee up. A doctor was summoned, who spent ten minutes attempting to revive him before sending him by ambulance to <!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Lee was dead by the time he reached the hospital.</p>
       <p>There was no visible external injury; however, according to autopsy reports, his <!--del_lnk--> brain had swollen considerably, from 1,400 to 1,575&nbsp;grams (a 13% increase). Lee was 32 years old. The only substance found during the autopsy was Equagesic. On 15 October 2005, Chow stated in an interview that Lee died from a <!--del_lnk--> hypersensitivity to the muscle relaxant (meprobamate) in Equagesic, which he described as a common ingredient in painkillers. When the doctors announced Lee's death officially, it was ruled a "death by misadventure".</p>
       <p>Controversy occurred when Don Langford, Lee's personal physician in Hong Kong, who had treated Lee during his first collapse believed that "Equagesic was not at all involved in Bruce's first collapse".</p>
       <p>However, <!--del_lnk--> Donald Teare, a <!--del_lnk--> forensic scientist recommended by <!--del_lnk--> Scotland Yard who had overseen over 1000 autopsies, was the top expert assigned to the Lee case. His conclusion was that the death was caused by an acute cerebral edema due to a reaction to compounds present in the prescription painkilling drug Equagesic, where Teare concluded "death by misadventure".</p>
       <p>The preliminary opinion of the <!--del_lnk--> neurosurgeon who saved Lee's life during his first seizure, Peter Wu, was that the cause of death should have been attributed to either a reaction to cannabis or Equagesic. However, Wu later backed off from this position, stating that:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>"Professor Teare was a forensic scientist recommended by Scotland Yard; he was brought in as an expert on cannabis and we can't contradict his testimony. The dosage of cannabis is neither precise nor predictable, but I've never known of anyone dying simply from taking it."</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>Lee's wife Linda returned to her hometown of <a href="../../wp/s/Seattle.htm" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>, and had him buried at lot 276 of <!--del_lnk--> Lakeview Cemetery. Pallbearers at his funeral on 31 July 1973 included Taky Kimura, <!--del_lnk--> Steve McQueen, <!--del_lnk--> James Coburn, <!--del_lnk--> Chuck Norris, <!--del_lnk--> George Lazenby, <!--del_lnk--> Dan Inosanto, Peter Chin, and Lee's brother <!--del_lnk--> Robert.</p>
       <p>Lee's <!--del_lnk--> iconic status and untimely demise fed many theories about his death, including murder involving the <!--del_lnk--> triads and a supposed curse on him and his family. <i><!--del_lnk--> Black Belt</i> magazine in 1985 carried the speculation that the death of Bruce Lee in 1973 may have been caused by "a delayed reaction to a <!--del_lnk--> Dim Mak strike he received several weeks prior to his collapse". As well other authors have said the death of Bruce Lee may have been due to a "Vibrating Palm technique".</p>

Ted Wong holds 2nd rank in Jeet Kune Do certified directly by Bruce Lee and was later promoted to Instructor under Dan Inosanto; feeling that Bruce would have wanted to promote him.

       <p>James Yimm Lee, a close friend of Lee, died without certifying additional students apart from Gary Dill who studied Jeet Kune Do under James and received permission via a personal letter from him in 1972 to pass on his learning of JKD to others. Taky Kimura, to date, has certified only one person in Jun Fan Gung Fu: his son Andy Kimura. Dan Inosanto continued to teach and certify select students in <!--del_lnk--> Jeet Kune Do for over 30 years, making it possible for thousands of martial arts practitioners to trace their training lineage back to Bruce Lee. Prior to his death, Lee told his then only two living instructors Kimura and Inosanto (James Yimm Lee had died in 1972) to dismantle his schools.</p>
       <p>Both Taky Kimura and Dan Inosanto were allowed to teach small classes thereafter, under the guideline "keep the numbers low, but the quality high". Bruce also instructed several World Karate Champions including <!--del_lnk--> Chuck Norris, <!--del_lnk--> Joe Lewis, and Mike Stone. Between the three of them, during their training with Bruce they won every Karate Championship in the United States.</p>

       <p>There are a number of stories (perhaps <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Apocrypha.htm" title="Apocryphal">apocryphal</a>) surrounding Lee that are still repeated in <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong culture. One is that his early 70s interview on the <!--del_lnk--> TVB show <!--del_lnk--> Enjoy Yourself Tonight cleared the busy streets of Hong Kong as everyone was watching the interview at home.</p>
       <p>On 6 January 2009, it was announced that Bruce's Hong Kong home (41 Cumberland Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong) will be preserved and transformed into a tourist site by philanthropist Yu Pang-lin.</p>

       <p>Bruce Lee was named by <i><!--del_lnk--> Time Magazine</i> as one of the <!--del_lnk--> 100 most influential people of the 20th century.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Martial_arts_lineage">Martial arts lineage</span></h2>
       <p>Lee was trained in Wu Tai Chi Chuan (also known as Ng-ga) and Jing Mo Tam Tui for the twelve sets. Lee was trained in the martial arts <!--del_lnk--> Choy Li Fut, Western Boxing, &Eacute;p&eacute;e fencing, Judo, Praying Mantis Kung-fu, Hsing-I, and Jujitsu.</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">When Bruce arrived in the US he (already) had training in Wu Style Tai Chi, sometimes in Hong Kong called Ng-ga. And he had of course training in western boxing. He had training in fencing from his brother, that's Epee, that goes from toe to head. He had training obviously in Wing Chun. And the other area was the training he had received in Buk Pie, or Tam Toi, he was twelve sets in Tam Toi. And I believe he had traded with a Choy Li Fut man.</div>
