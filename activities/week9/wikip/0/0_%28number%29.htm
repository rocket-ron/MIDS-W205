       <p><b>0</b> is the <a href="../../wp/i/Integer.htm" title="Integer">integer</a> immediately preceding <a href="../../wp/1/1_%2528number%2529.htm" title="1 (number)">1</a>. In most <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_mathematics.htm" title="History of mathematics">cultures</a>, 0 was identified before the idea of negative things that go lower than zero was accepted. <!--del_lnk--> Zero is an even number, because it is divisible by <!--del_lnk--> 2. 0 is neither positive nor negative. By some definitions 0 is also a <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_number.htm" title="Natural number">natural number</a>, and then the only natural number not to be positive. Zero is a number which quantifies a count or an amount of <!--del_lnk--> null size.</p>
       <p>The value, or <i>number</i>, zero is not the same as the <i>digit</i> zero, used in <a href="../../wp/n/Numeral_system.htm" title="Numeral system">numeral systems</a> using <!--del_lnk--> positional notation. Successive positions of digits have higher weights, so inside a numeral the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system, for example, in the number 02. In some instances, a <!--del_lnk--> leading zero may be used to distinguish a number.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="As_a_year_label">As a year label</span></h2>
       <p>In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Before Christ">BC</a> <!--del_lnk--> calendar era, the year <!--del_lnk--> 1 BC is the first year before <!--del_lnk--> AD 1; no room is reserved for a <!--del_lnk--> year zero. By contrast, in <!--del_lnk--> astronomical year numbering, the year 1&nbsp;BC is numbered 0, the year 2&nbsp;BC is numbered &minus;1, and so on.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Names">Names</span></h2>
       <p>In 976 the <!--del_lnk--> Persian encyclopedist <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Khwarizmi, in his "Keys of the Sciences", remarked that if, in a calculation, no number appears in the place of tens, a little circle should be used "to keep the rows". This circle the Arabs called &#x635;&#x641;&#x631; <i>&#x1E63;ifr</i>, "empty". That was the earliest mention of the name <i>&#x1E63;ifr</i> that eventually became <i>zero</i>.</p>
       <p>Italian <i>zefiro</i> already meant "west wind" from Latin and Greek <i><!--del_lnk--> zephyrus</i>; this may have influenced the spelling when transcribing Arabic <i>&#x1E63;ifr</i>. The Italian mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Fibonacci (c.1170&ndash;1250), who grew up in North Africa and is credited with introducing the decimal system to Europe, used the term <i>zephyrum</i>. This became <i>zefiro</i> in Italian, which was contracted to <i>zero</i> in Venetian.</p>
       <p>As the decimal zero and its new mathematics spread from the Arab world to Europe in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, words derived from <i>&#x1E63;ifr</i> and <i>zephyrus</i> came to refer to calculation, as well as to privileged knowledge and secret codes. According to Ifrah, "in thirteenth-century Paris, a 'worthless fellow' was called a '... cifre en algorisme', i.e., an 'arithmetical nothing'." From <i>&#x1E63;ifr</i> also came French <i>chiffre</i> = "digit", "figure", "number", <i>chiffrer</i> = "to calculate or compute", <i>chiffr&eacute;</i> = "encrypted". Today, the word in Arabic is still <i>&#x1E63;ifr</i>, and cognates of <i>&#x1E63;ifr</i> are common in the languages of Europe and southwest Asia.</p>

       <p>The modern numerical digit 0 is usually written as a circle or ellipse. Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter <!--del_lnk--> O more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0. <a href="../../wp/t/Typewriter.htm" title="Typewriter">Typewriters</a> originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did not even have a separate key for the digit 0. The distinction came into prominence on modern character <!--del_lnk--> displays.</p>
       <p>A <!--del_lnk--> slashed zero can be used to distinguish the number from the letter. The digit 0 with a dot in the centre seems to have originated as an option on <!--del_lnk--> IBM 3270 displays and has continued with the some modern computer typefaces such as <!--del_lnk--> Andal&eacute; Mono. One variation uses a short vertical bar instead of the dot. Some fonts designed for use with computers made one of the capital-O&ndash;digit-0 pair more rounded and the other more angular (closer to a rectangle). A further distinction is made in <!--del_lnk--> German car number plates by slitting open the digit 0 on the upper right side. Sometimes the digit 0 is used either exclusively, or not at all, to avoid confusion altogether.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_history">Early history</span></h3>
       <p>By the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, the <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian mathematics had a sophisticated <!--del_lnk--> sexagesimal positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a <i>space</i> between sexagesimal numerals. By 300&nbsp;BC, a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was co-opted as a <!--del_lnk--> placeholder in the same <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian system. In a tablet unearthed at <!--del_lnk--> Kish (dating from about 700&nbsp;BC), the scribe B&ecirc;l-b&acirc;n-aplu wrote his zeros with three hooks, rather than two slanted wedges.</p>
       <p>The Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone. Nor was it used at the end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2&times;60), 3 and 180 (3&times;60), 4 and 240 (4&times;60), looked the same because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder. Only context could differentiate them.</p>
       <p>Records show that the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greeks</a> seemed unsure about the status of zero as a number. They asked themselves, "How can nothing be something?", leading to <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophical</a> and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of zero and the <!--del_lnk--> vacuum. The <!--del_lnk--> paradoxes of <!--del_lnk--> Zeno of Elea depend in large part on the uncertain interpretation of zero.</p>
       <p>The concept of zero as a number and not merely a symbol for separation is attributed to India where by the 9th century AD practical calculations were carried out using zero, which was treated like any other number, even in case of division. The Indian scholar <!--del_lnk--> Pingala (circa 5th-2nd century BC) used <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Binary_number.htm" title="Binary numeral system">binary numbers</a> in the form of short and long syllables (the latter equal in length to two short syllables), making it similar to <a href="../../wp/m/Morse_code.htm" title="Morse code">Morse code</a>. He and his contemporary Indian scholars used the Sanskrit word <i><!--del_lnk--> &#x15B;&#x16B;nya</i> to refer to zero or <i>void</i>.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mesoamerican Long Count calendar developed in south-central Mexico and Central America required the use of zero as a place-holder within its <!--del_lnk--> vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system. Many different glyphs, including this partial <!--del_lnk--> quatrefoil&mdash;<a class="image" href="../../images/1033/103394.png.htm"><img alt="MAYA-g-num-0-inc-v1.svg" height="25" src="../../images/1033/103394.png"  width="30" /></a>&mdash;were used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the earliest of which (on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, <!--del_lnk--> Chiapas) has a date of 36&nbsp;BC. Since the eight earliest Long Count dates appear outside the Maya homeland, it is assumed that the use of zero in the Americas predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the Olmecs. Many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland, although the Olmec civilization ended by the 4th century BC, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count dates.</p>
       <p>Although zero became an integral part of <!--del_lnk--> Maya numerals, it did not influence <!--del_lnk--> Old World numeral systems.</p>

Zero is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.</p>
       <p>The use of a blank on a counting board to represent 0 dated back in India to 4th century BC.</p>
       <p>In China, <!--del_lnk--> counting rods were used for decimal calculation since the 4th century BC including the use of blank spaces. Chinese mathematicians understood negative numbers and zero, some mathematicians used &#x7121;&#x5165;, &#x7A7A;, &#x53E3; for the latter, until <!--del_lnk--> Gautama Siddha introduced the symbol 0. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</i>, which was mainly composed in the 1st century AD, stated "[when subtracting] subtract same signed numbers, add differently signed numbers, subtract a positive number from zero to make a negative number, and subtract a negative number from zero to make a positive number."</p>
       <p>By 130&nbsp;AD, <a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Hipparchus and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for zero (a small circle with a long overbar) within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic <!--del_lnk--> Greek numerals. Because it was used alone, not just as a placeholder, this <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic zero was perhaps the first documented use of a <i>number</i> zero in the Old World. However, the positions were usually limited to the fractional part of a number (called minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths, etc.)&mdash;they were not used for the integral part of a number. In later <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> manuscripts of Ptolemy's <i>Syntaxis Mathematica</i> (also known as the <i>Almagest</i>), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the Greek letter <!--del_lnk--> omicron (otherwise meaning 70).</p>
       <p>Another zero was used in tables alongside <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_numerals.htm#Zero" title="Roman numerals">Roman numerals</a> by 525 (first known use by <!--del_lnk--> Dionysius Exiguus), but as a word, <i>nulla</i> meaning "nothing", not as a symbol. When division produced zero as a remainder, <i>nihil</i>, also meaning "nothing", was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval <!--del_lnk--> computists (calculators of <a href="../../wp/e/Easter.htm" title="Easter">Easter</a>). The initial "N" was used as a zero symbol in a table of Roman numerals by <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a> or his colleague around 725.</p>
       <p>In 498&nbsp;AD, Indian mathematician and astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Aryabhata stated that "Sthanam sthanam dasa gunam" or place to place in ten times in value, which is the origin of the modern decimal-based place value notation.</p>
       <p>The oldest known text to use a decimal <!--del_lnk--> place-value system, including a zero, is the Jain text from India entitled the <i><!--del_lnk--> Lokavibh&acirc;ga</i>, dated 458&nbsp;AD. This text uses Sanskrit numeral words for the digits, with words such as the Sanskrit word for <i>void</i> for zero. The first known use of special <!--del_lnk--> glyphs for the decimal digits that includes the indubitable appearance of a symbol for the digit zero, a small circle, appears on a stone inscription found at the <!--del_lnk--> Chaturbhuja Temple at <!--del_lnk--> Gwalior in India, dated 876&nbsp;AD. There are many documents on copper plates, with the same small <i>o</i> in them, dated back as far as the sixth century AD, but their authenticity may be doubted.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_numerals.htm" title="Arabic numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> and the positional number system were introduced around 500&nbsp;AD, and in 825&nbsp;AD, it was introduced by a <!--del_lnk--> Persian scientist, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mu%25E1%25B8%25A5ammad_ibn_M%25C5%25ABs%25C4%2581_al-Khw%25C4%2581rizm%25C4%25AB.htm" title="Al-Khw&#x101;rizm&#x12B;">al-Khw&#x101;rizm&#x12B;</a>, in his book on arithmetic. This book synthesized Greek and Hindu knowledge and also contained his own fundamental contribution to mathematics and science including an explanation of the use of zero.</p>
       <p>It was only centuries later, in the 12th century, that the Arabic numeral system was introduced to the <!--del_lnk--> Western world through <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> translations of his <i>Arithmetic</i>.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rules_of_Brahmagupta">Rules of Brahmagupta</span></h3>
       <p>The rules governing the use of zero appeared for the first time in <!--del_lnk--> Brahmagupta's book <i><!--del_lnk--> Brahmasputha Siddhanta (The Opening of the Universe)</i>, written in 628&nbsp;AD. Here Brahmagupta considers not only zero, but negative numbers, and the algebraic rules for the elementary operations of arithmetic with such numbers. In some instances, his rules differ from the modern standard. Here are the rules of Brahmagupta:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The sum of zero and a negative number is negative.</li>
        <li>The sum of zero and a positive number is positive.</li>
        <li>The sum of zero and zero is zero.</li>
        <li>The sum of a positive and a negative is their difference; or, if their absolute values are equal, zero.</li>
        <li>A positive or negative number <!--del_lnk--> when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator.</li>
        <li>Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator.</li>
        <li>Zero divided by zero is zero.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>In saying zero divided by zero is zero, Brahmagupta differs from the modern position. Mathematicians normally do not assign a value to this, whereas computers and calculators sometimes assign <!--del_lnk--> NaN, which means "not a number." Moreover, non-zero positive or negative numbers when divided by zero are either assigned no value, or a value of unsigned infinity, positive infinity, or negative infinity. Once again, these assignments are not numbers, and are associated more with computer science than pure mathematics, where in most contexts no assignment is done.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Zero_as_a_decimal_digit">Zero as a decimal digit</span></h3>
       <p>Positional notation without the use of zero (using an empty space in tabular arrangements, or the word <i>kha</i> "emptiness") is known to have been in use in India from the 6th century. The earliest certain use of zero as a <i>decimal</i> positional digit dates to the 5th century mention in the text <!--del_lnk--> Lokavibhaga. The glyph for the zero digit was written in the shape of a dot, and consequently called <i><!--del_lnk--> bindu</i> ("dot"). The dot had been used in Greece during earlier ciphered numeral periods.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Hindu-Arabic numeral system (base 10) reached Europe in the 11th century, via the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian Peninsula through Spanish <!--del_lnk--> Muslims, the <!--del_lnk--> Moors, together with knowledge of <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> and instruments like the <!--del_lnk--> astrolabe, first imported by <!--del_lnk--> Gerbert of Aurillac. For this reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as "<a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_numerals.htm" title="Arabic numerals">Arabic numerals</a>". The Italian mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Fibonacci or Leonardo of Pisa was instrumental in bringing the system into European mathematics in 1202, stating:</p>

        <p>After my father's appointment by his homeland as state official in the customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed in the study of calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hindus</a> (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0 ... any number may be written.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Here Leonardo of Pisa uses the phrase "sign 0", indicating it is like a sign to do operations like addition or multiplication. From the 13th century, manuals on calculation (adding, multiplying, extracting roots, etc.) became common in Europe where they were called <i><!--del_lnk--> algorismus</i> after the Persian mathematician al-Khw&#x101;rizm&#x12B;. The most popular was written by <!--del_lnk--> Johannes de Sacrobosco, about 1235 and was one of the earliest scientific books to be <i>printed</i> in 1488. Until the late 15th century, Hindu-Arabic numerals seem to have predominated among mathematicians, while merchants preferred to use the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_numerals.htm" title="Roman numerals">Roman numerals</a>. In the 16th century, they became commonly used in Europe.</p>

       <p>The number 0 is the smallest <!--del_lnk--> non-negative integer. The <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_number.htm" title="Natural number">natural number</a> following 0 is 1 and no natural number precedes 0. The number 0 <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_number.htm#History_of_natural_numbers_and_the_status_of_zero" title="Natural number">may or may not be considered a natural number</a>, but it is a whole number and hence a <a href="../../wp/r/Rational_number.htm" title="Rational number">rational number</a> and a <a href="../../wp/r/Real_number.htm" title="Real number">real number</a> (as well as an <!--del_lnk--> algebraic number and a <a href="../../wp/c/Complex_number.htm" title="Complex number">complex number</a>).</p>
       <p>The number 0 is neither positive nor negative and appears in the middle of a <!--del_lnk--> number line. It is neither a <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_number.htm" title="Prime number">prime number</a> nor a <!--del_lnk--> composite number. It cannot be prime because it has an <a href="../../wp/i/Infinity.htm" title="Infinity">infinite</a> number of <a href="../../wp/d/Divisor.htm" title="Divisor">factors</a> and cannot be composite because it cannot be expressed by multiplying prime numbers (0 must always be one of the factors). Zero is, however, <!--del_lnk--> even (see <!--del_lnk--> parity of zero).</p>
       <p>The following are some basic (elementary) rules for dealing with the number 0. These rules apply for any real or complex number <i>x</i>, unless otherwise stated.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Addition: <i>x</i> + 0 = 0 + <i>x</i> = <i>x</i>. That is, 0 is an <!--del_lnk--> identity element (or neutral element) with respect to <a href="../../wp/a/Addition.htm" title="Addition">addition</a>.</li>
        <li>Subtraction: <i>x</i> &minus; 0 = <i>x</i> and 0 &minus; <i>x</i> = &minus;<i>x</i>.</li>
        <li>Multiplication: <i>x</i> &middot; 0 = 0 &middot; <i>x</i> = 0.</li>
        <li>Division: <span class="frac nowrap"><sup>0</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>x</i></sub></span> = 0, for nonzero <i>x</i>. But <span class="frac nowrap"><sup><i>x</i></sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub></span> is <!--del_lnk--> undefined, because 0 has no <!--del_lnk--> multiplicative inverse (no real number multiplied by 0 produces 1), a consequence of the previous rule; see <!--del_lnk--> division by zero.</li>
        <li>Exponentiation: <i>x</i><sup>0</sup> = <sup><i>x</i></sup>/<sub><i>x</i></sub> = 1, except that the case <i>x</i> = 0 may be left undefined in some contexts; see <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Exponentiation.htm" title="0 to the power of 0">Zero to the zero power</a>. For all positive real <i>x</i>, 0<sup><i>x</i></sup> = 0.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The expression <span class="frac nowrap"><sup>0</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub></span>, which may be obtained in an attempt to determine the limit of an expression of the form <span class="frac nowrap"><sup><i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>g</i>(<i>x</i>)</sub></span> as a result of applying the <a href="../../wp/l/Limit_of_a_function.htm" title="Limit of a function">lim</a> operator independently to both operands of the fraction, is a so-called "<!--del_lnk--> indeterminate form". That does not simply mean that the limit sought is necessarily undefined; rather, it means that the limit of <span class="frac nowrap"><sup><i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>g</i>(<i>x</i>)</sub></span>, if it exists, must be found by another method, such as <!--del_lnk--> l'H&ocirc;pital's rule.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> The sum of 0 numbers is 0, and <!--del_lnk--> the product of 0 numbers is 1. The <a href="../../wp/f/Factorial.htm" title="Factorial">factorial</a> 0! evaluates to 1.</p>

        <li>In <a href="../../wp/s/Set_theory.htm" title="Set theory">set theory</a>, 0 is the <!--del_lnk--> cardinality of the empty set: if one does not have any apples, then one has 0 apples. In fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is <i><!--del_lnk--> defined</i> to be the empty set. When this is done, the empty set is the <!--del_lnk--> Von Neumann cardinal assignment for a set with no elements, which is the empty set. The cardinality function, applied to the empty set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.</li>
        <li>Also in set theory, 0 is the lowest <a href="../../wp/o/Ordinal_number.htm" title="Ordinal number">ordinal number</a>, corresponding to the empty set viewed as a <!--del_lnk--> well-ordered set.</li>
        <li>In <!--del_lnk--> propositional logic, 0 may be used to denote the <!--del_lnk--> truth value false.</li>
        <li>In <a href="../../wp/a/Abstract_algebra.htm" title="Abstract algebra">abstract algebra</a>, 0 is commonly used to denote a <!--del_lnk--> zero element, which is a <!--del_lnk--> neutral element for addition (if defined on the structure under consideration) and an <!--del_lnk--> absorbing element for multiplication (if defined).</li>
        <li>In <!--del_lnk--> lattice theory, 0 may denote the <!--del_lnk--> bottom element of a <!--del_lnk--> bounded lattice.</li>

When there are finitely many zeros these are called the roots of the function. See also <!--del_lnk--> zero (complex analysis) for zeros of a <!--del_lnk--> holomorphic function.</li>
        <li>The zero function (or zero map) on a domain <i>D</i> is the <!--del_lnk--> constant function with 0 as its only possible output value, i.e., the function <i>f</i> defined by <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = 0</span> for all <i>x</i> in <i>D</i>.

       <p>The value zero plays a special role for many physical quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen. For example, on the <a href="../../wp/k/Kelvin.htm" title="Kelvin">Kelvin</a> temperature scale, zero is the coldest possible temperature (<!--del_lnk--> negative temperatures exist but are not actually colder), whereas on the <a href="../../wp/c/Celsius.htm" title="Celsius">Celsius</a> scale, zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the <a href="../../wp/m/Melting_point.htm" title="Melting point">freezing point</a> of water. Measuring sound intensity in <!--del_lnk--> decibels or <!--del_lnk--> phons, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value&mdash;for example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> zero-point energy is the lowest possible <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> that a <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> <!--del_lnk--> physical system may possess and is the energy of the <!--del_lnk--> ground state of the system.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemistry">Chemistry</span></h3>
       <p>Zero has been proposed as the <a href="../../wp/a/Atomic_number.htm" title="Atomic number">atomic number</a> of the theoretical element <!--del_lnk--> tetraneutron. It has been shown that a cluster of four <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutrons</a> may be stable enough to be considered an <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atom</a> in its own right. This would create an <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_element.htm" title="Chemical element">element</a> with no <a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">protons</a> and no charge on its <a href="../../wp/a/Atomic_nucleus.htm" title="Atomic nucleus">nucleus</a>.</p>
       <p>As early as 1926, Professor Andreas von Antropoff coined the term <!--del_lnk--> neutronium for a conjectured form of <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">matter</a> made up of neutrons with no protons, which he placed as the chemical element of atomic number zero at the head of his new version of the <a href="../../wp/p/Periodic_table.htm" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a>. It was subsequently placed as a noble gas in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_computer_science">In computer science</span></h2>
       <p>The most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one, and this is the practice in early classic <a href="../../wp/c/Computer_science.htm" title="Computer science">computer science</a> programming languages such as <!--del_lnk--> Fortran and <!--del_lnk--> COBOL. However, in the late 1950s <!--del_lnk--> LISP introduced <!--del_lnk--> zero-based numbering for arrays while <!--del_lnk--> Algol 58 introduced completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or other of these positions. For example, the elements of an <!--del_lnk--> array are numbered starting from 0 in C, so that for an array of <i>n</i> items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to <span class="nowrap"><i>n</i>&minus;1</span>. This permits an array element's location to be calculated by adding the index directly to address of the array, whereas 1 based languages precalculate the array's base address to be the position one element before the first.</p>
       <p>There can be confusion between 0 and 1 based indexing, for example Java's <!--del_lnk--> JDBC indexes parameters from 1 although <!--del_lnk--> Java itself uses 0-based indexing.</p>
       <p>In databases, it is possible for a field not to have a value. It is then said to have a <!--del_lnk--> null value. For numeric fields it is not the value zero. For text fields this is not blank nor the empty string. The presence of null values leads to <!--del_lnk--> three-valued logic. No longer is a condition either <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>, but it can be <i>undetermined</i>. Any computation including a null value delivers a null result. Asking for all records with value 0 or value not equal 0 will not yield all records, since the records with value null are excluded.</p>
       <p>A <!--del_lnk--> null pointer is a pointer in a computer program that does not point to any object or function. In C, the integer constant 0 is converted into the null pointer at <!--del_lnk--> compile time when it appears in a pointer context, and so 0 is a standard way to refer to the null pointer in code. However, the internal representation of the null pointer may be any bit pattern (possibly different values for different data types).</p>
       <p>In mathematics <img alt="-0 = 0 = +0" class="tex" src="../../images/1033/103398.png" />, both <!--del_lnk--> &minus;0 and +0 represent exactly the same number, i.e., there is no "negative zero" distinct from zero. In some <!--del_lnk--> signed number representations (but not the <!--del_lnk--> two's complement representation used to represent integers in most computers today) and most <!--del_lnk--> floating point number representations, zero has two distinct representations, one grouping it with the positive numbers and one with the negatives; this latter representation is known as <!--del_lnk--> negative zero.</p>
