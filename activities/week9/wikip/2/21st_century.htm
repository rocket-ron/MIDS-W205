       <p>Digital technology, in its early stages of mainstream use in the 1980s and 1990s, became widely accepted by most of the world, though concerns about <!--del_lnk--> stress from the overuse of <a href="../../wp/m/Mobile_phone.htm" title="Mobile phone">mobile phones</a>, the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> and related technologies remains controversial.</p>
       <p>In 2011, nearly 5 billion people globally (about 67% of the world's population) used <a href="../../wp/m/Mobile_phone.htm" title="Mobile phone">mobile phones</a> and about 2 billion people (about 28% of the world's population) used the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pronunciation">Pronunciation</span></h2>
       <p>Among experts and the general public, there is a debate as to how specific years of the 21st century should be pronounced in English. Regarding this, academics suggested that since former years such as 1805 and 1905 were commonly pronounced as "eighteen oh" or "nineteen oh" five, the year 2005 should naturally have been pronounced as "twenty oh-five". A less common variation would have been "twenty nought-five". Generally, the <!--del_lnk--> early years of the 21st century were pronounced as "two-thousand and five", with a change taking place in <a href="../../wp/2/2010.htm" title="2010">2010</a>, where pronunciations often shift between the early-year standard of "two-thousand and ten" and the common approach used in the late 20th-century of "twenty-ten".</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Vancouver Olympics, which took place in 2010, was being officially referred to by <i>Vancouver 2010</i> as "the twenty-ten olympics", while 2011 and 2013 are popular as well. The latest timeframes for change are usually placed at 2020.</p>
       <p>According to The <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Kubrick archives, in the press release for his film <i><!--del_lnk--> 2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, film director Stanley Kubrick included specific instructions for journalists to refer to the movie as "two thousand and one" instead of the commonplace pronunciation of "twenty-oh-one". Kubrick said he did this in the hope that if the film became popular, it would influence the pronunciation of that year.</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Politics_and_wars">Politics and wars</span></h2>
       <p>Genocide still remains a problem in the century with the concern of the <a href="../../wp/w/War_in_Darfur.htm" title="War in Darfur">war in Darfur</a> and the growing concern in <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>. Low estimates on the deaths in Darfur stand around 200,000 deaths with 2.5 million in displacement, there has been much outcry against the <!--del_lnk--> perpetrators, the Sudanese government, and the very weak international response. Also controversies from past genocides remain commonplace in the minds of victims and average people alike.</p>

        <li>1998&ndash;2002 &ndash; The <a href="../../wp/s/Second_Congo_War.htm" title="Second Congo War">Second Congo War</a> continued into the early 21st century. A 1999 ceasefire quickly broke down and a UN peacekeeping mission, <!--del_lnk--> MONUC, was unable to control the fighting. Troops from <a href="../../wp/r/Rwanda.htm" title="Rwanda">Rwanda</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> continued to support rebel groups against the <a href="../../wp/d/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo.htm" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> and rifts also grew between Rwanda and Uganda as they accused each other of supporting rival rebel groups as well. <!--del_lnk--> Laurent Kabila, president of the DRC, was assassinated in <!--del_lnk--> January 2001 and his son, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Kabila, took power. Throughout 2002 steps were made towards peace and Rwanda and Uganda both removed their troops from the country. On <!--del_lnk--> December 17, 2002, a massive treaty officially ended the war. However, the DRC only holds power in less than half of the country, with most of the eastern and northern portions still controlled by rebel groups, where there is still significant infighting. In addition, Rwanda still supports anti-DRC rebels and anti-Rwandan rebels continue to operate from the DRC. The war killed an estimated 3.9 million people, displaced nearly 5.5 million, and led to a widespread and ongoing famine that continues to result in deaths. Severe human rights violations continue to be reported.</li>

        <li>2003&ndash;present &ndash; In <!--del_lnk--> February 2003, a conflict in <!--del_lnk--> Darfur, <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, began and soon escalated into <a href="../../wp/w/War_in_Darfur.htm" title="War in Darfur">full-scale war</a>. By 2008 it was believed that up to 400,000 people had been killed and over 2.5 million displaced. In 2005, the ICC decided that Darfur war criminals would be tried, and on <!--del_lnk--> July 14, 2008, Sudanese president <!--del_lnk--> Omar al-Bashir was charged with 5 accounts of crimes against humanity and 2 accounts of war crimes, although the ICC has no power to enforce these charges.</li>
        <li>2003&ndash;2010 &ndash; The <!--del_lnk--> U.S.-led coalition <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Iraq_War.htm" title="War in Iraq">invaded</a> Iraq on <!--del_lnk--> March 20, 2003, and overthrew the government of <!--del_lnk--> Saddam Hussein (who was executed by the Iraqi government on <!--del_lnk--> December 30, <a href="../../wp/2/2006.htm" title="2006">2006</a>). Coalition troops remain in the country to install a democratic government and fight an escalating insurgency. In addition to an insurgency against the American presence, Iraq also suffered from a <!--del_lnk--> civil war for several years. The war was soon seen as the central front of the War on Terror by many governments, despite growing international dissatisfaction with the war. The total death toll has been estimated at near 150,000 but these estimations are highly disputed, with one highly disputed study guessing even over 1 million. After the U.S.-led coalition initiated a <!--del_lnk--> troop surge in 2007, casualty numbers have decreased significantly. Combat ended, at least officially, in <!--del_lnk--> August 2010.</li>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Issues_and_concerns">Issues and concerns</span></h2>
       <p><i>There are several points-of-view pertaining to the following items, all of which should be considered accordingly.</i></p>
       <p>Issues that have been frequently discussed and debated so far in this century include:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b><a href="../../wp/g/Globalization.htm" title="Globalization">Globalization</a>.</b> Advances in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Telecommunication.htm" title="Telecommunications">telecommunications</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transportation">transportation</a>, the expansion of <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> democracy, and <!--del_lnk--> free trade agreements have resulted in unprecedented global economic and cultural integration. This has caused (and is continuing to cause) economic and cultural shifts which have been the subject of considerable controversy. <div class="thumb tright">
          <div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/2753/275346.jpg.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="295" src="../../images/2753/275346.jpg"  width="200" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">
            <div class="magnify"><a class="internal" href="../../images/2753/275346.jpg.htm" title="Enlarge"><img alt="" height="11" src="../../images/36/3696.png" width="15" /></a></div><a href="../../wp/d/Dhaka.htm" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> in 2006. Almost 97% of future population growth will occur in developing countries.</div>
          </div>
         </div>
        </li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Overpopulation.</b> The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <!--del_lnk--> estimates that <a href="../../wp/w/World_population.htm" title="World population">world population</a> will reach 9.2 billion by mid-century. Such growth raises questions of ecological <!--del_lnk--> sustainability and creates many <!--del_lnk--> economic and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Political">political</a> disruptions. In response, many countries have adopted policies which either force or encourage their citizens to have fewer children, and others have limited <!--del_lnk--> immigration. Considerable debate exists over what the ultimate carrying capacity of the planet may be; whether or not population growth containment policies are necessary; to what degree growth can safely occur thanks to increased economic and <!--del_lnk--> ecological efficiency; and how distribution mechanisms should accommodate demographic shifts. Evidence suggests that developed countries (such as Japan) suffer population <i><!--del_lnk--> implosion,</i> and the population debate is strongly tied with discussions about the <!--del_lnk--> distribution of wealth.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Abortion.</b> Debates between "<!--del_lnk--> Pro-choice" and "<!--del_lnk--> Pro-life" factions on the controversial procedure continue. The approximate number of induced abortions performed worldwide in 2003 was 42 million.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Gay rights</b> are a major political issue in many places, with <!--del_lnk--> same sex marriage being legalized in several jurisdictions during the first decade of the century, but outlawed by constitutional amendment in other places. Meanwhile, some countries such as <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> moved to toughen their laws against any sort of <!--del_lnk--> homosexual behaviour. Political battles over pro- or anti-gay legislation provoked much activism in the streets and on the Internet.</li>
        <li><b><a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">Poverty</a>.</b> Poverty remains the root cause of many of the world's other ills, including <a href="../../wp/f/Famine.htm" title="Famine">famine</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Disease.htm" title="Disease">disease</a>, and insufficient <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>. Poverty contains many self-reinforcing elements (for instance, poverty can make education an unaffordable luxury, which tends to result in continuing poverty) that various aid groups hope to rectify in this century. <!--del_lnk--> Microcredit lending has also started to gain a profile as a useful anti-poverty tool.</li>
        <li><b><a href="../../wp/d/Disease.htm" title="Disease">Disease</a>.</b> <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/HIV%252FAIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a> each kill over a million people annually. <a href="../../wp/h/HIV.htm" title="HIV">HIV</a> remains without a cure or vaccine, and is growing rapidly in India and much of the African continent. <!--del_lnk--> Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern for organisms such as <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. Other diseases, such as <!--del_lnk--> SARS, <!--del_lnk--> ebola, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Influenza.htm" title="Flu">flu</a> variations, are also causes for concern. The <a href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> has <!--del_lnk--> warned of a possible coming flu <!--del_lnk--> pandemic resulting from <!--del_lnk--> bird flu <!--del_lnk--> mutations. In 2009, there was an outbreak of <!--del_lnk--> swine flu whose country of origin is still unknown.</li>
        <li><b><a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">War</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Terrorism.htm" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>.</b> <!--del_lnk--> Active conflicts continue around the world, including civil wars in the <a href="../../wp/d/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo.htm" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (the largest war since <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>), <!--del_lnk--> Chechnya, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Ivory_Coast.htm" title="C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire">C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Somalia.htm" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Senegal.htm" title="Senegal">Senegal</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> (mainly in <!--del_lnk--> Darfur), and <a href="../../wp/l/Libya.htm" title="Libya">Libya</a>. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/September_11_attacks.htm" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">9/11 terrorist attacks</a> triggered invasions of <!--del_lnk--> Afghanistan and partially and controversially <!--del_lnk--> Iraq. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/War_on_Terror.htm" title="War on Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a> has seen controversies over <!--del_lnk--> civil liberties, accusations of <!--del_lnk--> torture, continued terrorist attacks and ongoing instability, violence, and military occupation.

Considerable concern remains about <!--del_lnk--> nuclear proliferation, especially in <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>, and the availability of <!--del_lnk--> weapons of mass destruction to rogue groups.</li>
        <li><b><a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">Global warming</a>.</b> Climate scientists have postulated that the earth is undergoing significant <!--del_lnk--> anthropogenic (human-induced) <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. The resulting economic and ecological costs are hard to predict. Some scientists argue that human-induced global warming risks considerable losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services unless considerable sociopolitical changes are introduced, particularly in patterns of mass consumption and transportation. <div class="thumb tright">

        </li>
        <li><b><a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">Fossil fuels</a></b> are becoming scarce and more expensive, due to the escalating <!--del_lnk--> demand for <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> ("oil") and oil-based products such as <!--del_lnk--> gasoline and <!--del_lnk--> kerosene, unmatched by production. Discovery of new <!--del_lnk--> oil fields has not been sufficient to sustain current levels of production, and some fear that the earth may be running out of economically viable oil, pressing for alternatives. As <a href="../../wp/b/Biofuel.htm" title="Biofuel">Agrofuel</a>, one possible alternative, yields further hazards for the environment and endangers food security, debate is far from over. <!--del_lnk--> Electric cars such as the <!--del_lnk--> Nissan Leaf have been built to address the problem of <!--del_lnk--> peak oil.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Power in international relations.</b> Issues surrounding the cultural, economic, and military dominance of the United States and its role in the world community have become even more pointed given its recent military activities, problematic relations with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, disagreement over several international treaties, and its economic policies with regard to globalization. Integration of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> and the <a href="../../wp/a/African_Union.htm" title="African Union">African Union</a> have proceeded.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Intellectual property.</b> The increasing popularity of digital formats for entertainment media such as movies and music, and the ease of copying and distributing it via the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> and <!--del_lnk--> peer-to-peer networks, has raised concerns in the media industry about <!--del_lnk--> copyright infringement. Much debate is proceeding about the proper bounds between protection of <!--del_lnk--> copyright, <!--del_lnk--> trademark and <!--del_lnk--> patent rights versus <!--del_lnk--> fair use and the <!--del_lnk--> public domain, where some argue that such laws have shifted greatly towards intellectual property owners and away from the interests of the general public in recent years, while others say that such legal change is needed to deal with a perceived threat of new technologies against the rights of authors and artists (or, as others put it, against the outmoded business models of the current entertainment industry). <!--del_lnk--> Domain name "cybersquatting" and access to patented drugs and generics to combat epidemics in third-world countries are other IP concerns.</li>
        <li><b><a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">Technology</a></b> developments show no sign of slowing. <!--del_lnk--> Communications and control technology continues to augment the intelligence of individual humans, collections of humans, and machines. Cultures are forced into the position of sharply defining humanity and determining boundaries on desire, thought, communication, behaviour, and manufacturing. Some, notably <!--del_lnk--> Ray Kurzweil, have predicted that by the middle of the century there will be a <!--del_lnk--> Technological Singularity if <!--del_lnk--> artificial intelligence that outsmart humans is created.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> NATO&ndash;Russia relations</b> seem to remain strained as the "Western Alliance" and NATO square off with Russia and other nations over international policy and the future of the ex-Soviet sphere. An Eastern Europe Missile Defense Shield, military and social conflicts in former Yugoslavia and the Caucasus (particularly Georgia and Chechnya), fossil fuel infrastructures like the <!--del_lnk--> Nabucco pipeline and the future of nuclear arsenals are among the topics that have strained the relations between the two sides with eerie reminders reminiscent of the Cold War.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Water crisis.</b> As the human population increases, so has the demand for water. <!--del_lnk--> Desalination has been used more and more to address this issue.</li>
