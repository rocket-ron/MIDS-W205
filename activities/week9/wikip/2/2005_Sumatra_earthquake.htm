       <p>The <b>2005 Sumatra earthquake</b>, referred to as the <b>Nias Earthquake</b> by the scientific community, was a major earthquake on <!--del_lnk--> 28 March, <a href="../../wp/2/2005.htm" title="2005">2005</a>, located off the west coast of northern <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. Approximately 1,300 people were killed by the earthquake, mostly on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Nias. The event caused panic in the region, which had previously been devastated by the massive <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a> triggered by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>, but this earthquake generated a relatively tiny tsunami that caused limited damage. It was the 4th most powerful earthquake since 1964.</p>
       <p>The earthquake occurred at 16:09:36 <!--del_lnk--> UTC (11:09:36 P.M. local time) on <!--del_lnk--> March 28, <a href="../../wp/2/2005.htm" title="2005">2005</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> hypocenter was located at <span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><!--del_lnk--> <span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">2&deg;04&prime;35&Prime;N</span> <span class="longitude">97&deg;00&prime;58&Prime;E</span></span></span></span>, 30 km (18.6 miles) below the surface of the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, where <!--del_lnk--> subduction is forcing the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Australian Plate to the south-west under the <!--del_lnk--> Eurasian plate Sunda edge. The area is 200 km west of <!--del_lnk--> Sibolga, <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, or 1,400 km northwest of <a href="../../wp/j/Jakarta.htm" title="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, roughly halfway between the islands of <!--del_lnk--> Nias and <!--del_lnk--> Simeulue. Seismic recordings give the <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a> a <!--del_lnk--> magnitude of about 8.7, and effects were felt as far away as <a href="../../wp/b/Bangkok.htm" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, a distance of 1,000 km. </p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The earthquake lasted for about two minutes in total. In the twenty-four hours immediately after the event, there were eight major aftershocks, measuring between 5.5 and 6.0. A debate arose among seismologists over whether this should be considered an aftershock of the December 2004 event, or a "triggered earthquake" as it was larger than typical aftershocks but on the same fault.</p>
       <p>On the Indonesian island of <!--del_lnk--> Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake. The death toll on Nias was at least one thousand, with 220 dying in <!--del_lnk--> Gunungsitoli, the island's largest town. Nearly half of Gunungsitoli's population (27,000) fled the town.</p>
       <p>The earthquake was strongly felt across the island of <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, and caused widespread <!--del_lnk--> power outages in the Indonesian city of <!--del_lnk--> Banda Aceh, already devastated by the December 2004 tsunami, and prompted thousands to flee their homes and seek higher ground.</p>
       <p>It was also strongly felt along the west coast of Thailand and Malaysia, and in <a href="../../wp/k/Kuala_Lumpur.htm" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> high-rise buildings were evacuated. The earthquake was felt less strongly in the <a href="../../wp/m/Maldives.htm" title="Maldives">Maldives</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.<br clear="right" />
       </p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tsunami">Tsunami</span></h2>
       <p>The earthquake caused great concern around the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> that it might trigger a tsunami similar to the massive one generated three months earlier by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> on December 26, 2004. Evacuations were carried out in coastal regions of <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>. This earthquake, however, produced a relatively tiny tsunami. A three-meter tsunami caused moderate damage to port and airport facilities on <!--del_lnk--> Simeulue, and a two-meter tsunami was recorded on the west coast of Nias. Much smaller waves, most detectable only in <!--del_lnk--> tide gauge recording systems, were recorded across the Indian Ocean; for example, a 25 <!--del_lnk--> cm wave was recorded at <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Colombo.htm" title="Colombo, Sri Lanka">Colombo, Sri Lanka</a>.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">Tsunami</a> warnings were issued by the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre, operated by the US <!--del_lnk--> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) , and by the government of <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. There were initial concerns that a major tsunami could be generated, particularly travelling south from the event's hypocenter.</p>
       <p>Portions of Thailand's southern coast were evacuated as a precaution, and NOAA advised an evacuation of 965 km (600 miles) of coastline in Sumatra. Evacuations also occurred in the northern <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysian</a> states of <!--del_lnk--> Penang and <!--del_lnk--> Kedah, as well as the eastern coast of <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, where ten people were killed in the confusion of the evacuation. Many of the southern states of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> were also put on high alert; all of these areas had seen significant damage from December's tsunami. After the detection of a minor tsunami south of the epicenter, including a 30 cm tsunami on Australia's <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cocos_%2528Keeling%2529_Islands.htm" title="Cocos Islands">Cocos Islands</a>, the island states of <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritius.htm" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/s/Seychelles.htm" title="Seychelles">Seychelles</a> in the Indian Ocean issued warnings to their populations.</p>
       <p>Although tsunami warning systems for the region had been actively discussed before the December 2004 earthquake, none had yet been implemented in the Indian Ocean.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Humanitarian_response">Humanitarian response</span></h2>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> worked with the Indonesian government to take further actions to prevent a possible catastrophe after the strong earthquake, and the US <!--del_lnk--> State Department has announced that it will help countries affected by a possible tsunami. The government of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> announced aid of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="USD">USD</a> 2 million for the earthquake victims.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> announced it would provide <!--del_lnk--> AUD 1 million in emergency aid, and, at the request of the <!--del_lnk--> Indonesian Government, dispatched <!--del_lnk--> Australian Defence Force medical teams and equipment to Nias. The Australian naval ship <!--del_lnk--> HMAS Kanimbla , having only recently left Aceh, was redeployed to the region from <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. At about 9:30 (UTC) <!--del_lnk--> 2 April <a href="../../wp/2/2005.htm" title="2005">2005</a>, one of Kanimbla's two Sea King helicopters, <!--del_lnk--> Shark 02, crashed on the island of Nias while taking medical personnel to a village. Nine personnel were killed, and two others sustained injuries but were rescued from the site by the other helicopter. The crash occurred one day before a <!--del_lnk--> state visit by <!--del_lnk--> President <!--del_lnk--> Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to Australia, where he and <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister of Australia <a href="../../wp/j/John_Howard.htm" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> expressed mutual sorrow for their countries' losses.</p>
