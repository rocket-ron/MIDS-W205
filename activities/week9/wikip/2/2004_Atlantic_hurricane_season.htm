       <p>The <b>2004 Atlantic hurricane season</b> had an unusually late date of <!--del_lnk--> formation for the first <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>. It was also notable because more than half of the season's 16&nbsp;tropical cyclones brushed or struck the United States. The <!--del_lnk--> hurricane season officially began on June&nbsp;1, and ended on November&nbsp;30. Despite an <!--del_lnk--> El Ni&ntilde;o, the season was above average. The first storm, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Alex_%25282004%2529.htm" title="Hurricane Alex (2004)">Alex</a>, developed offshore of the <!--del_lnk--> Southeastern United States on July&nbsp;31. It brushed the <!--del_lnk--> The Carolinas and the <!--del_lnk--> Mid-Atlantic, causing relatively minor impact. Other storms that resulted in minor impacts include <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Storms Bonnie, <!--del_lnk--> Earl, Hermine, and <!--del_lnk--> Matthew, and <!--del_lnk--> Subtropical Storm Nicole. In addition, <!--del_lnk--> Hurricanes Danielle, <!--del_lnk--> Karl, and <!--del_lnk--> Lisa, Tropical Depression Ten, and Tropical Storm Otto caused no impact on land while a tropical cyclone.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Charley.htm" title="Hurricane Charley">Hurricane Charley</a> became the second-costliest hurricane in United States history, at the time, after striking Florida as a Category&nbsp;4, leaving $14&nbsp;billion in damage. Later in August, <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Frances became the third costliest U.S. hurricane, primarily due to impact in Florida. The most significant storm in terms of intensity and damage was <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Ivan.htm" title="Hurricane Ivan">Hurricane Ivan</a>. It was a <!--del_lnk--> Category 5 hurricane that devastated multiple countries adjacent to the <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, before entering the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and bringing catastrophic impact to the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Coast of the United States. After becoming extratropical on August&nbsp;18, the remnants executed a large cyclonic loop and regenerated into a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on August&nbsp;22. It later struck Texas and quickly dissipated. In the United State alone, Ivan caused $18.8&nbsp;billion in losses, more than Hurricane Charley. The most significant tropical cyclone in terms of deaths was <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Jeanne. In <a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>, torrential rainfall in the mountains resulted in mudslides and severe flooding, causing at least 3,006&nbsp;fatalities. The storm also left 8&nbsp;deaths in <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, 18&nbsp;in the <a href="../../wp/d/Dominican_Republic.htm" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>, and 5&nbsp;in the United States, for a total of at least 3,036&nbsp;people killed.</p>
       <p>Collectively, the storms of this season caused at least 3,258 deaths and $50&nbsp;billion in damage, making it the costliest Atlantic hurricane season at the time, until <a href="../../wp/2/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season">the following season</a>. Additionally, 2004 was also the deadliest Atlantic hurricane season since <!--del_lnk--> 1998. With 6&nbsp;hurricanes reaching at least Category&nbsp;3 intensity, 2004 also had the most major hurricanes since <!--del_lnk--> 1964. However, that record would also be surpassed in 2005, with 7&nbsp;major hurricanes that year. In the spring of 2005, four names were retired, which were Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne &ndash; tying the then-record most names with <!--del_lnk--> 1955 and <!--del_lnk--> 1995 &ndash; but surpassed with five in 2005.</p>

       <p>Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. <!--del_lnk--> William M. Gray and his associates at <!--del_lnk--> Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Government's <!--del_lnk--> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). According to CSU, the average season between 1950 and 2000 had 9.6&nbsp;tropical storms, 5.9&nbsp;hurricanes, and 2.3&nbsp;major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category&nbsp;3 on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12&nbsp;named storms, of which five to seven reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes.</p>
       <p>On May&nbsp;17, prior to the start of the season, NOAA forecasters predicted a 50% probability of activity above the normal range, with 12&ndash;15&nbsp;tropical storms, 6&ndash;8&nbsp;of those becoming hurricanes, and 2&ndash;4&nbsp;of those hurricanes reaching at least Category&nbsp;3 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Dr. Gray released a prediction on May 28 that was similar, with 14&nbsp;named storms, 8&nbsp;reaching hurricane strength, and 3&nbsp;reaching Category&nbsp;3 strength.</p>
       <p>Dr. Gray announced he had revised his predictions slightly downwards on August&nbsp;6, citing mild <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/El_Ni%25C3%25B1o%25E2%2580%2593Southern_Oscillation.htm" title="El Ni&ntilde;o">El Ni&ntilde;o</a> conditions. His new forecast was 13&nbsp;named storms, 7&nbsp;hurricanes, and 3&nbsp;reaching Category&nbsp;3. Several days later, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of above-to-near normal activity, but the same number of storms forecast. A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 6&nbsp;to 14&nbsp;tropical storms, 4&nbsp;to 8&nbsp;of which reach hurricane strength, and 1&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;of those reaching Category&nbsp;3 strength. The season ended up with 16&nbsp;tropical depressions, 15&nbsp;named storms, 9&nbsp;hurricanes, and 6&nbsp;major hurricanes, placing it above all forecasts.</p>

       <p>The 2004&nbsp;season was very deadly, with about 3,352&nbsp;fatalities overall. Nearly all of the deaths were reported in Haiti following the floods and mudslides caused by Tropical Storm Jeanne. The other tropical cyclones that caused fatalities include Hurricane Alex, Charley, Frances, Gaston, and Ivan, and Tropical Storms Bonnie and Earl. Because four out of the six major hurricanes made several landfalls, the season was also extremely damaging, with losses estimated at about $50&nbsp;billion, over half of which was caused by Hurricanes Charley and Ivan. While damage estimates from Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne amounted to $9.6&nbsp;billion  and $7&nbsp;billion, respectively. A few other tropical cyclones caused light to moderate damage, including Hurricanes Alex and Gaston and Tropical Storms Bonnie and Matthew. Despite the season being very costly, it is a distant second to the <a href="../../wp/2/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, which resulted in $128&nbsp;billion (2005&nbsp;USD) in damages.</p>
       <p>A tropical low in May brought torrential flooding to <a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haiti</a> and the <a href="../../wp/d/Dominican_Republic.htm" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>, killing 2,000&nbsp;people and causing great damage. Though it was not officially classified as a tropical storm, it did have a circulation with loosely organized convection, resembling a <!--del_lnk--> subtropical cyclone.</p>

       <p>The country that suffered the worst damage during the season by far, was the United States, due to being impacted by 9&nbsp;tropical cyclones. Hurricane Alex produced strong winds, moderately heavy rainfall, and storm surge in The Carolinas and portions of the Mid-Atlantic in early August. However, because it remained offshore, only $7.5&nbsp;million in damage was reported. One fatality occurred when a man drowned near <!--del_lnk--> Nags Head, North Carolina. About a week later, Tropical Storm Bonnie made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> Apalachicola, Florida on August&nbsp;12. Because winds and rainfall was light, most of the impact occurred due to tornadoes, especially in Florida, <!--del_lnk--> South Carolina, North Carolina, and <!--del_lnk--> Virginia. 3&nbsp;deaths and $1.27&nbsp;million in damage was the result of this storm. Only 22&nbsp;hours after Bonnie made landfall, Hurricane Charley struck <!--del_lnk--> Dry Tortugas and then <!--del_lnk--> Cayo Costa State Park, Florida. Because Charley was a Category&nbsp;4, it caused significant damage in Southwest and Central Florida. More than 29,000&nbsp;buildings and houses were damaged to some degree and 2&nbsp;million people were left without electricity in the state of Florida, alone. 29&nbsp;deaths and about $13.5&nbsp;billion in damage was reported. In South Carolina, 2,231&nbsp;houses were impacted, 135,000&nbsp;power outages occurred, while 1&nbsp;death and losses reached $40&nbsp;million. Winds and tornadoes in North Carolina left 65,000&nbsp;customers without electricity and destroyed 40&nbsp;houses and damaged 2,231&nbsp;others. Damage within North Carolina was estimated to be $50&nbsp;million. Effects were nil elsewhere in the United States from Charley, though one fatality occurred in <a href="../../wp/r/Rhode_Island.htm" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a> due to drowning.</p>
       <p>Later in August, Hurricane Gaston caused moderate damage in The Carolinas and Virginia due to strong winds and heavy precipitation. The storm caused 156,500&nbsp;power outages, impacted more than 2,000&nbsp;buildings, and left about $70&nbsp;million in losses in both of The Carolinas combined. Extensive flooding occurred in some areas of eastern Virginia, particularly the <!--del_lnk--> Richmond area. 20&nbsp;blocks of the city was inundated, 120&nbsp;roads were closed, including a portion of <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 95, and 350&nbsp;homes and 230&nbsp;businesses were damaged or destroyed. Nine people were killed and damage in Virginia reached $60&nbsp;million. On August&nbsp;31, Tropical Storm Hermine made landfall in eastern <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts. It brought light rainfall and tropical storm force winds, but no damage or fatalities were reported.</p>
       <p>Tropical Storm Matthew in October produced inland and coastal flooding, especially in Louisiana and Mississippi. Several roads were flooded in both state and 2,500&nbsp;people lost electricity in Louisiana. The storm left a mere $305,000&nbsp;in damage.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Caribbean">Caribbean</span></h4>
       <p>In the <a href="../../wp/c/Cayman_Islands.htm" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, Ivan produced sustained winds as high as 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h) and gusts up to 171&nbsp;mph (275&nbsp;km/h) on <!--del_lnk--> Grand Cayman. Storm surge of 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m) was reported, as well as precipitation amounts peaking at 12.14 inches (308&nbsp;mm). There was extensive destruction to communication, electric infrastructure, housing, and agriculture in Cuba, due to strong winds, waves of 15&nbsp;feet (4.6&nbsp;m) in <!--del_lnk--> Cienfuegos, and rainfall up to 13.3 inches (340&nbsp;mm) in <!--del_lnk--> Pinar del R&iacute;o. Overall there was 2&nbsp;deaths and $3.5&nbsp;billion in losses.</p>
       <p>In association with Hurricane Ivan, there was extensive destruction to communication, electric infrastructure, housing, and agriculture in Cuba, due to strong winds, waves of 15&nbsp;feet (4.6&nbsp;m) in <!--del_lnk--> Cienfuegos, and rainfall up to 13.3 inches (340&nbsp;mm) in <!--del_lnk--> Pinar del R&iacute;o. Losses in Cuba reached about $1.2&nbsp;billion and there was no fatalities.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Canada">Canada</span></h4>
       <p>Several tropical cyclone and their remnants effected Canada, albeit minimally. The remnants of Tropical Storm Bonnie dropped up to 3.5 inches (89&nbsp;mm) of rain in New Brunswick caused widespread road closures, basement flooding, and 1&nbsp;death by drowning. Minor flooding also occurred in buildings. Damage totaled about $2.38&nbsp;million ($3&nbsp;million 2004&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> CAD). The remnants of Hurricane Charley produced up to 2.2 inches (56&nbsp;mm) and 1.1 inches (28&nbsp;mm) of rain in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, respectively. Hurricane Gaston was becoming extratropical while passed offshore of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Mostly light rainfall was report, peaking at about 2.1 inches (53&nbsp;mm) on Sable Island. At the end of August and the beginning of September, the remnants of Tropical Storm Hermine caused minor street and basement flooding, especially in New Brunswick.</p>
       <p>Record-breaking rains fell as the remnants of Hurricane Frances crossed Atlantic Canada. Numerous roads were closed and several communities were flooded and thousands were left without power in the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Ontario, <!--del_lnk--> Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Damage was estimated to have reached about $44.9&nbsp;million ($45&nbsp;million CAD) A few areas of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Sable Island reported rainfall in association with the remnants of Hurricane Jeanne. Precipitation reached nearly 4 inches (100&nbsp;mm) in <!--del_lnk--> Cape Race, Newfoundland. Gusty winds from the remnants of Subtropical Storm Nicole left at least 11,300&nbsp;people without electricity in <!--del_lnk--> Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick alone. Significant rainfall was also produced in the region, peaking at about 5 inches (130&nbsp;mm) in northeastern Nova Scotia.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Elsewhere">Elsewhere</span></h4>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/b/Bermuda.htm" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, Subtropical Storm Nicole brought heavy rainfall, tropical storm force winds, and rough seas to the island. 1,800&nbsp;people were left without electricity, a popular music festival was canceled, and several passengers on cruise became seasick. Other than that, no impact was report in Bermuda. The extratropical remnants of Hurricane Karl brought wind gusts up to 89&nbsp;mph (144&nbsp;km/h) to <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>.</p>

       <p>The 2004 season had numerous unusual occurrences. The first named storm of the season formed on August 1, giving the season the fifth-latest start since the <!--del_lnk--> 1952 season. Florida was hit by four hurricanes: <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Charley.htm" title="Hurricane Charley">Hurricane Charley</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Frances, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Ivan.htm" title="Hurricane Ivan">Ivan</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Jeanne. It was the first time four hurricanes have hit one state in one season since four hurricanes hit the <!--del_lnk--> Texas coast in the <!--del_lnk--> 1886 season, including the <!--del_lnk--> Indianola Hurricane of 1886 that destroyed the city of <!--del_lnk--> Indianola. There were many other hurricanes in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season that were individually unusual. <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Alex_%25282004%2529.htm" title="Hurricane Alex (2004)">Hurricane Alex</a> was the strongest hurricane on record to intensify north of 38&deg;N latitude. One storm, Tropical Storm Earl, died out, and its remains crossed over into the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, regenerated, and became Hurricane Frank in the eastern Pacific.</p>
       <p>August 2004 was active, with eight named storms forming during the month despite a weak <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/El_Ni%25C3%25B1o%25E2%2580%2593Southern_Oscillation.htm" title="El Ni&ntilde;o">El Ni&ntilde;o</a> emerging during the summer. In an average year, only three or four storms would be named in August. The formation of eight named storms in August breaks the old record of seven for the month, set in the <!--del_lnk--> 1933 and 1995 seasons. It also ties with September in the <!--del_lnk--> 2002, <!--del_lnk--> 2007 and the <!--del_lnk--> 2010 seasons for the most Atlantic tropical storms to form in any month.</p>
       <p>The most unusual storm of the season was <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Ivan.htm" title="Hurricane Ivan">Hurricane Ivan</a>. Ivan first became the first major <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic hurricane (Category&nbsp;3 or above) on record to form as low as 10&deg;N latitude. Ivan was also recorded as the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record, but has since fallen to tenth. One very unusual occurrence in relation to Ivan happened on September 22, when a remnant <!--del_lnk--> low from Ivan&mdash;which had traveled in a circular motion over the southeastern United States&mdash;was reclassified as a tropical depression as it moved over the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. The system was given the name Ivan and eventually strengthened into a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical storm">tropical storm</a> with winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) before making landfall along the coast of <!--del_lnk--> Texas, causing minimal flooding and damage.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Accumulated_cyclone_energy_.28ACE.29">Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE)</span></h3>
       <p>The season's activity was reflected with a high cumulative <!--del_lnk--> accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 227. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> knots (39&nbsp;mph, 63&nbsp;km/h) or tropical storm strength. <!--del_lnk--> Subtropical cyclones, such as <!--del_lnk--> Nicole or the early portion of Otto's track, are excluded from the total.</p>

       <p>In late July, a weak surface trough interacted with a tropical wave near The Bahamas. By late on July&nbsp;31, the system developed into Tropical Depression One while centered about 200 miles (320&nbsp;km) east of <!--del_lnk--> Jacksonville, Florida. After initially being poorly organized, the depression strengthened and became Tropical Storm Alex late on August&nbsp;1. As a result of being the first named storm, it was fifth-latest start to a season in 50&nbsp;years. The storm moved northeastward and became a hurricane on August&nbsp;3. Later that day, Alex passed less than 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) from <!--del_lnk--> Cape Hatteras while a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane. As it moved out to sea, it intensified into a Category&nbsp;3 hurricane and peaked with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). Due to its location, Alex reached major hurricane status second farthest north in the Atlantic, after <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Ella in 1973. After passing south of <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland, Alex weakened due to cooler <!--del_lnk--> sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and late on August&nbsp;6 Alex was absorbed by a large <!--del_lnk--> extratropical cyclone.</p>
       <p>A rough seas and storm surge up to 6 feet (1.8&nbsp;m) on the <!--del_lnk--> Outer Banks of <!--del_lnk--> North Carolina caused minor beach erosion and washed out portions of a highway in <!--del_lnk--> Cape Fear. A man drowned near <!--del_lnk--> Nags Head due to these conditions. Strong winds also pelted the area, with maximum sustained winds reaching 88&nbsp;mph (142&nbsp;km/h) and gusts up to 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) in <!--del_lnk--> Morehead City. As a result, 10,000&nbsp;buildings and houses were left without electricity. In combination with strong winds and storm surge, more than 100&nbsp;buildings and houses were damaged. Additionally, rainfall up to 7.55 inches (192&nbsp;mm) on the Outer Banks flooded nearly 500&nbsp;cars. Losses in North Carolina reached about $7.5&nbsp;million. In <!--del_lnk--> Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, 3&nbsp;people were injured by rip currents, while 5&nbsp;others were hospitalized in <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey.</p>

The depression strengthened further upon reaching the Gulf of Mexico and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie on August&nbsp;9. A break in a mid-level ridge re-curved Bonnie northward on August&nbsp;10 and then northeastward on August&nbsp;11. Later that day, the storm peaked with winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h), before wind shear began weakening it. At 1400&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;12, Bonnie made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> Apalachicola, Florida with winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h). The storm rapidly weakened inland and degenerated an a remnant low offshore of New Jersey on August&nbsp;14.</p>

In <!--del_lnk--> North Florida, scattered power outages were reported, and rainfall and storm surge flooded roads, especially in <!--del_lnk--> Taylor County. A tornado in Jacksonville damage several businesses and homes. Tornadoes were also reported in The Carolinas, and Virginia, with one in North Carolina destroying 17&nbsp;homes, impacting 59&nbsp;others, and causing 3&nbsp;deaths and $1.27&nbsp;million in damage. In <!--del_lnk--> Greenville County, South Carolina, a few roads were washed out, while portions of <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Route 501 were inundated with 1 foot (0.30&nbsp;m) of water. Minor flooding also occurred in Mid-Atlantic and New England. In Atlantic Canada, basement and road flooding was reported, especially in <!--del_lnk--> Edmundston, New Brunswick.

       <p>A westward-moving tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Three on August&nbsp;9 to the south-southeast of Barbados. Early on August&nbsp;10, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Charley, before reaching hurricane intensity south of Jamaica on August&nbsp;11. Charley continued to strengthen after curving northwestward and was a 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) Category&nbsp;3 hurricane when it made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> Alqu&iacute;zar, Cuba on August&nbsp;13. After emerging into the <!--del_lnk--> Straits of Florida, Charley weakened to a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane. However, the storm abruptly strengthened into a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane later on August&nbsp;13, with winds peaking at 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). At 1945&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;13, Charley made landfall at <!--del_lnk--> Cayo Costa, Florida, followed by another landfall in <!--del_lnk--> Punta Gorda about an hour later. Charley rapidly weakened over Florida, falling to Category&nbsp;1 by early on August&nbsp;14. Later that day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic, before making two more landfalls in <!--del_lnk--> Cape Romain and <!--del_lnk--> Myrtle Beach, South Carolina as a minimal hurricane. Late on August&nbsp;14, Charley weakened to a tropical storm over southeastern North Carolina, shortly before becoming extratropical near <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Beach, Virginia.</p>
       <p>The storm brought rainfall and strong winds to the island of Jamaica. In <!--del_lnk--> Westmoreland Parish, flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways. Winds in the parish caused a large tree to fall on a house, resulting in significant damage to the home. In <a href="../../wp/k/Kingston%252C_Jamaica.htm" title="Kingston, Jamaica">Kingston</a>, high winds damaged power lines and homes. Widespread power outages occurred due to numerous downed trees and power lines. $4.1&nbsp;million in damage and 1&nbsp;fatality was reported in Jamaica. Winds up to 118&nbsp;mph (190&nbsp;km/h) in west-central Cuba left all of <!--del_lnk--> Pinar del R&iacute;o Province and more than 50% of <!--del_lnk--> La Habana Province without electricity for several days. Additionally, at least 70,290&nbsp;homes were either damaged or destroyed, as was 3,000&nbsp;agricultural institutions, and 95% of the sugar cane, bean, and banana crops. Charley was responsible for 4&nbsp;deaths and $923&nbsp;million in losses in Cuba. Impact in Florida was extreme, with strong winds causing 2&nbsp;million power outages and destroyed more than 2,149&nbsp;structures and damage an additional 26,755; this does not include the other buildings damaged on <!--del_lnk--> Gasparilla Island, the 95% of structures in downtown <!--del_lnk--> Arcadia, the 80% of buildings in <!--del_lnk--> Charlotte County, or the extensive impact on schools in Charlotte, <!--del_lnk--> DeSoto, <!--del_lnk--> Orange, and <!--del_lnk--> Osceola Counties. In Florida alone, Charley caused 29&nbsp;deaths, 792&nbsp;injuries, and $15.1&nbsp;billion in damage. A total of 2,231&nbsp;houses were damaged, with 2317&nbsp;of these were severely damaged and 40&nbsp;were destroyed and 135,000&nbsp;people were left without electricity in South Carolina. Winds up to 85 miles per hour (137&nbsp;km/h) in North Carolina downed trees and power lines, and left 65,000&nbsp;homes without power. Charley destroyed 40&nbsp;houses and damaged 2,231&nbsp;other homes in the state. The remnants of Charley produced light rainfall in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.</p>

       <p>At the time of peak intensity on August&nbsp;16, Danielle was heading northward to north-northwestward because of a subtropical ridge. Shortly thereafter, southwesterly vertical shear began increasing, causing the storm to weaken. Mid-level flow associated with a diffluent trough caused Danielle to move northeastward on August&nbsp;18. Later that day Danielle deteriorated to a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane, before being downgraded to a tropical storm. On August&nbsp;19, Danielle became nearly stationary and moved erratically while southwest of the Azores. Eventually, the storm curved west-southwestward and weakened to a tropical depression on August&nbsp;20. About 24&nbsp;hours later, Danielle degenerated into a remnant low pressure area.</p>

       <p>A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on August&nbsp;10. By August&nbsp;13, it developed into Tropical Depression Five while located about 1,150 miles (1,850&nbsp;km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression headed westward between 21 and 29 mph (34 and 47 km/h) due to a strong subtropical ridge located to its north. After developing banding features and an increase in Dvorak intensity estimates, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl at 1800&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;14. The storm strengthened slightly further and on the following day, it reached maximum sustained winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h). Later on August&nbsp;15, Earl crossed the Windward Islands and passed just south of <a href="../../wp/g/Grenada.htm" title="Grenada">Grenada</a>.</p>
       <p>Although Earl appeared well-organized, it unexpectedly degenerated into a tropical wave on August&nbsp;16 after a reconnaissance aircraft reported no closed circulation. The remnants eventually reached the Pacific Ocean and developed into <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Frank on August&nbsp;23. Tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall in Grenada damaged at least 34&nbsp;homes and a nursing home and toppled several trees and electrical poles.

       <p>Frances began as Tropical Depression Six on August 24, and it became a named storm on August 25 while well east of the <!--del_lnk--> Windward Islands. Frances strengthened rapidly, reaching Category&nbsp;4 intensity by August 27. Initially forecast to turn north and potentially threaten <a href="../../wp/b/Bermuda.htm" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, conditions changed and Frances's predicted track shifted westward. After grazing the <a href="../../wp/t/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands.htm" title="Turks and Caicos Islands">Turks and Caicos Islands</a>, it plowed through the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. From September 2 through September 4, Frances slowly ground its way across the Bahamas. Its slow movement allowed a record 2.5 to 3&nbsp;million Floridians to evacuate their homes. However, as it ground its way across the Bahamas, it weakened to a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane due to wind shear, although it was still a very large storm.</p>
       <p>After sitting stationary off the coast of Florida for nearly 24&nbsp;hours, Frances finally moved onto the coast of Florida in the early hours of September 5. It traveled northwest over land, briefly emerging over the Gulf of Mexico and striking the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Panhandle. As it passed over <!--del_lnk--> Georgia on September 6, it caused heavy rainfall across the southern United States. Over 15 inches (380&nbsp;mm) of rain were recorded in some places in North Carolina and <!--del_lnk--> Virginia, causing heavy flooding. Frances was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania on September 9.</p>
       <p>Damage to the United States was approximately $9&nbsp;billion (2004&nbsp;USD, $11.1&nbsp;billion 2013&nbsp;USD), making it the tenth costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Most of Hurricane Frances's damage occurred in Florida as a result of the storm's slow movement, large size, and long duration of winds. The storm is directly responsible for seven deaths; one in the Bahamas and six in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Hurricane Frances also produced 103 tornadoes as it moved its way through the United States.</p>

       <p>A frontal low pressure area developed into Tropical Depression Seven at 1200&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;27, while located about 130&nbsp;mi (210&nbsp;km) east-southeast of <!--del_lnk--> Charleston, South Carolina. The depression gradually strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston early on August&nbsp;28. Initially, Gaston tracked slowly, moving southeastward and then westward, before a developing mid- to upper-level ridge re-curved the storm northwestward. During this time, Gaston strengthened and became a hurricane at 1200&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;29. Two hours later, the storm made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> Awendaw, South Carolina with winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). Gaston weakened rapidly inland and was only a tropical depression by early on August&nbsp;30. Gaston re-strengthened into a tropical storm while located over eastern <!--del_lnk--> Virginia on August&nbsp;31, just hours before emerging into the Atlantic. Gaston re-intensified slightly further, but became extratropical near <!--del_lnk--> Sable Island on September&nbsp;1.</p>
       <p>In South Carolina, an unofficial measurement indicated wind gusts up to 82&nbsp;mph (132&nbsp;km/h) in South Capers Island, which is near <!--del_lnk--> Parris Island. Strong winds destroyed 8&nbsp;homes, damaged more than 3,000&nbsp;buildings, and left more than 150,000&nbsp;people without power. Additionally, flash flooding further inland severely damage or destroyed at least 20&nbsp;homes in <!--del_lnk--> Berkeley County. In North Carolina, widespread street flooding occurred, including inundation on portions of <!--del_lnk--> Interstates 40 and 95. Several trees were downed by strong winds, especially in <!--del_lnk--> Chatham and <!--del_lnk--> Johnston Counties. A tornado in <!--del_lnk--> Hoke County damaged several homes. Severe flooding occurred in east-central Virginia due to rainfall amounts up to 12.6 inches (320&nbsp;mm). In <!--del_lnk--> Chesterfield, <!--del_lnk--> Dinwiddie, <!--del_lnk--> Hanover, <!--del_lnk--> Henrico, and <!--del_lnk--> Prince George Counties, 350&nbsp;homes and 230&nbsp;businesses were damaged or destroyed, and many roads were closed due to high water. In Richmond, more than 120&nbsp;roads were closed, including a portion of Interstate 95, and 9&nbsp;fatalities, all of them related to the flooding. The remnants of Gaston caused impact limited to light rainfall in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Sable Island.</p>

       <p>A frontal zone that spawned <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Gaston developed an area of convection south of <a href="../../wp/b/Bermuda.htm" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> on August&nbsp;25. After detaching from the front and developed a circulation, the system became a tropical depression late on August&nbsp;27. It initially remained weak while the convection fluctuated, until intensifying into Tropical Storm Hermine at 1200&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;29. Later that day, wind shear exposed the circulation to the north of the convection, though the storm was able to a peak as a 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) tropical storm on August&nbsp;30. The storm turned northward under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge. Increased wind shear from Gaston weakened Hermine, and later on August&nbsp;30, the circulation was entirely exposed from the convection.</p>
       <p>Early on August&nbsp;31, Hermine made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> New Bedford, Massachusetts as a minimal tropical storm. It rapidly weakened while moving northward, and after becoming extratropical, Hermine was absorbed by a frontal zone later that day. The storm brought tropical storm force winds and light rainfall to eastern Massachusetts, reaching about 0.5 inches (13&nbsp;mm) in <!--del_lnk--> Cape Cod. The remnants of Hermine tracked across <!--del_lnk--> New Brunswick and produced locally heavy rainfall, peaking at about 2.2&nbsp;in (56&nbsp;mm). In <!--del_lnk--> Moncton, New Brunswick, minor basement flooding and street closures were reported. The storm also dropped slightly less than 2 inches (51&nbsp;mm) of rain in parts of Newfoundland.</p>

       <p>A westward-moving tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on September&nbsp;2, before becoming Tropical Storm Ivan on the following day. After reaching hurricane intensity on September&nbsp;5, the storm strengthened significantly, becoming a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane on September&nbsp;6. It subsequently weakened, though it reached major hurricane status again on next day. Late on September&nbsp;7, Ivan passed close to <a href="../../wp/g/Grenada.htm" title="Grenada">Grenada</a> while heading west-northwestward. Throughout the Lesser Antilles and in Venezuela, Ivan caused 44&nbsp;deaths and slightly more than $1.15&nbsp;billion in losses, with nearly all of the damage and fatalities in Grenada. While located near the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands_Antilles.htm" title="Netherlands Antilles">Netherlands Antilles</a> on September&nbsp;9, Ivan briefly became a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane. During the next five days, Ivan fluctuated between a Category&nbsp;4 and 5&nbsp;hurricane. While passing south of Hispaniola, the outerbands of Ivan caused 4&nbsp;deaths in Dominican Republic. Early on September&nbsp;11, the storm passed just south of Jamaica. In that country, high winds and heavy rainfall left $360&nbsp;million in damage and killed 17&nbsp;people. After clearing Jamaica, Ivan closely passed near the <a href="../../wp/c/Cayman_Islands.htm" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, bring strong winds that caused 2&nbsp;deaths and $3.5&nbsp;billion in losses. Ivan brushed western Cuba as a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane on September&nbsp;14, where a combination of rainfall, storm surge, and winds resulted in $1.2&nbsp;billion in damage, but no fatalities.</p>
       <p>Shortly after moving to the west of Cuba on September&nbsp;14, Ivan entered the Gulf of Mexico. Over the next two days, the storm gradually weakened while tracking north-northwestward and northward. At 0650&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;16, Ivan made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Shores, Alabama with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). It quickly weakened inland, falling to tropical storm status later that day and tropical depression strength by early on September&nbsp;17. The storm curved northeastward and eventually reached the <!--del_lnk--> Delmarva Peninsula, where it became extratropical on September&nbsp;18. The remnants of Ivan moved southward and then southwestward, crossing Florida on September&nbsp;21 and re-entering the Gulf of Mexico later that day. Late on September&nbsp;22, the remnants regenerated into Ivan in the central Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression, shortly before re-strengthening into a tropical storm. After reaching winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h), wind shear weakened Ivan back to a tropical depression on September&nbsp;24. Shortly thereafter, Ivan made a final landfall near <!--del_lnk--> Holly Beach, Louisiana with winds of 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h) and subsequently dissipated hours later. In the United States, Ivan produced a record <!--del_lnk--> tornado outbreak, with at least 119&nbsp;twisters spawned collectively in 9&nbsp;states.</p>

       <p>A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August&nbsp;29. Accompanied with a well-defined area of disturbed weather, the wave passed just north of Cape Verde on the following day. After moving westward for a few days, the wave became disorganized as it headed northwestward, northward and then northeastward. Despite displacement of deep convection due to southwesterly shear, a low-level circulation developed by September&nbsp;7. Thus, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Ten developed at 1200&nbsp;UTC, while located 725 miles (1,167&nbsp;km) southwest of the western Azores. Continuous effects of wind shear caused the depression to strengthen only slightly.</p>
       <p>By September&nbsp;9, the depression attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,009&nbsp;mbar (29.8&nbsp;inHg). Three hours after peak intensity, the National Hurricane Centre initiated advisories on the depression. It was noted that the depression could briefly become a tropical storm if there were convective bursts. However, later on September&nbsp;9, wind shear left the depression completely devoid of deep convection. As a result, it degenerated into a remnant low at 1200&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;9, while located west-southwest of the Azores.</p>

       <p>A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September&nbsp;13, and by September&nbsp;16, it developed into Tropical Depression Twelve while located 390 miles (630&nbsp;km) southwest of Cape Verde. The depression moved westward under a subtropical ridge and became Tropical Storm Karl later that day. On September&nbsp;17, the storm curved northwestward and continued strengthening, reaching hurricane status early on September&nbsp;18. Karl intensified significant while moving west to west-northwestward, and on September&nbsp;19, it became the final major hurricane of the season. The storm briefly became a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane on September&nbsp;20, before weakening slightly and subsequently re-strengthening to that intensity.</p>
       <p>Early on September&nbsp;21, Karl peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145&nbsp;mph (230&nbsp;km/h) while moving northwestward again. However, Karl weakened due to increasing wind shear, while moving northeastward in response to a baroclinic trough. After wind shear lessened, the storm briefly became a major hurricane again on September&nbsp;23. However, wind shear returned later that day and SST's began cooling. Another trough re-curved Karl northward on September&nbsp;24 and the storm gradually weakened. Early on September&nbsp;25, Karl became extratropical while located about 585 miles (941&nbsp;km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. While a tropical cyclone, Karl did not impact land. However, the remnants of the storm produced sustained winds up to 89&nbsp;mph (143&nbsp;km/h) and gusts reaching 112&nbsp;mph (180&nbsp;km/h) on <!--del_lnk--> Mykines in the <a href="../../wp/f/Faroe_Islands.htm" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a>.</p>

       <p>On September&nbsp;16, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic. Three days later, the wave developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen while located about 520 miles (840&nbsp;km) west-southwest of Cape Verde. Despite unfavorable conditions from being located near Hurricane Karl, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Lisa on September&nbsp;20. After nearly reaching hurricane status, Lisa began executing a small cyclonic loop due to a <!--del_lnk--> Fujiwhara interaction with a tropical wave. Additionally, the interaction caused Lisa to weaken to a tropical depression on September&nbsp;23. During the next several days, the storm fluctuated in intensity, from a tropical depression to a strong tropical storm. A deep mid- to upper-level trough caused Lisa to turn northward on September&nbsp;25.</p>
       <p>By October&nbsp;1, a short-wave trough re-curved and accelerated Lisa toward the northeast. The storm strengthened and was finally upgraded to a hurricane at 0600&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;2. At that time, Lisa attained its peak intensity with winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987&nbsp;mbar (29.1&nbsp;inHg). However, after SST's dropped to around <span style="white-space:nowrap;">73.4 &deg;F</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(23.0&nbsp;&deg;C)</span>, Lisa weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm later on October&nbsp;2. The storm lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 1200&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;3. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Lisa were absorbed by a frontal zone while located about 1,150 miles (1,850&nbsp;km) of Cape Race, Newfoundland.</p>

       <p>A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September&nbsp;19. It eventually reached the Gulf of Mexico and developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen on October&nbsp;8, while located about 205 miles (330&nbsp;km) southeast of <!--del_lnk--> Brownsville, Texas. The depression strengthened and became Tropical Storm Matthew six hours later. The storm moved generally northeastward or northward throughout its duration. After briefly weakening, Matthew attained its peak intensity late on October&nbsp;9, with winds reaching 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997&nbsp;mbar (29.4&nbsp;inHg). At 1100&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;10, Matthew made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> Cocodrie, Louisiana as a weak tropical storm. Only an hour later, Matthew weakened to a tropical depression and became extratropical early on October&nbsp;11.</p>
       <p>The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Louisiana, with multiple areas receiving more than 15 inches (380&nbsp;mm); the precipitation peak was 18 inches (460&nbsp;mm) in <!--del_lnk--> Haynesville. Storm surge and heavy rainfall flooded 20&nbsp;homes in <!--del_lnk--> Terrebonne Parish and several others in <!--del_lnk--> Lafourche Parish. Several roads briefly closed, including portions of <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 10 and <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Route 11. A tornado also damaged the roof of a trailer in <!--del_lnk--> Golden Meadow. Overall, losses in Louisiana reached $255,000. In Mississippi, wind and storm surge damage was minor, reaching only $50,000. Other than rainfall in several states, impact outside of Mississippi and Louisiana was negligible.</p>

       <p>The interaction between an upper-level trough and a cold front developed a low pressure area on October&nbsp;8 to the southwest of Bermuda. It developed a curved band of convection northwest of the centre, and it organized into Subtropical Storm Nicole by October&nbsp;10. An approaching mid-level trough turned the system northeastward, and early on October 11 it passed about 60&nbsp;miles (95&nbsp;km) northwest of Bermuda. As it passed the island, Nicole and its precursor dropped 5.86&nbsp;inches (148&nbsp;mm) of rainfall, and wind gusts reached 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h). The winds left 1,800&nbsp;homes and businesses without power, while the unsettled conditions caused airport delays.</p>
       <p>After passing Bermuda, Nicole developed an area of convection near the centre, suggesting the beginning of a transition to a tropical cyclone. However, strong <!--del_lnk--> wind shear caused weakening after the storm reached peak winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h). A larger extratropical storm absorbed Nicole on October&nbsp;11 to the south of Nova Scotia. The combination of the two storms produced flooding rains and gusty winds across Atlantic Canada. Since 2002, <!--del_lnk--> subtropical storms have been assigned names from the same sequence as tropical storms. Nicole was the first named storm under this policy that never achieved tropical status.</p>

       <p>The interaction of a cold front and a strong upper-level trough resulted in the development of an extratropical low pressure area about midway between the Azores and the Lesser Antilles on November&nbsp;26. The low deepened and gradually lost frontal characteristics. By 1200&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;29, the system was classified as Subtropical Storm Otto while located about 1,150 miles (1,850&nbsp;km) east-southeast of Bermuda. Initially, the storm northwestward due to a weakness in a subtropical ridge. Late on November&nbsp;29, Otto attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h). Deep convection formed near the centre and the storm began transitioning to a warm core system.</p>
       <p>It was re-classified as Tropical Storm Otto at 1200&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;30. Although SST's were relatively cold, Otto did not quickly weaken, because of low wind shear. On December&nbsp;1, the storm curved southeastward and completed a cyclonic loop later that day. After wind shear began increasing, Otto started weakening and was downgraded to a tropical depression at 1200&nbsp;UTC on December&nbsp;2. At the time, Otto reached its minimum barometric pressure of 995&nbsp;mbar (29.4&nbsp;inHg), despite sustained winds of only 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h). Early on December&nbsp;3, Otto degenerated into a remnant low pressure while located about 920 miles (1,480&nbsp;km) southeast of Bermuda.</p>
