       <p>The <b>20th century</b> was the period between January 1, 1901 and December 31, 2000.</p>
       <p>The century had the first global-scale wars between several world powers across multiple continents in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">Nationalism</a> became a major political issue in the world in the 20th century that was acknowledged in <a href="../../wp/i/International_law.htm" title="International law">international law</a> with the acknowledgement of the right of nations to <!--del_lnk--> self-determination, official decolonization in the mid-century, and many nationalist-influenced armed conflicts - including both World Wars. <a href="../../wp/f/Feminism.htm" title="Feminism">Feminism</a> that demanded that women have equal rights to men, was a major political issue in the world, and particularly in the result of granting women <!--del_lnk--> suffrage in many countries.</p>
       <p>The century saw a major shift in the way that vast numbers of people lived, as a result of changes in politics, ideology, economics, society, culture, science, technology, and medicine. Terms like <i>ideology</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> world war</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> genocide,</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> nuclear war</i> entered common usage. Scientific discoveries, such as the <a href="../../wp/t/Theory_of_relativity.htm" title="Theory of relativity">theory of relativity</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum physics">quantum physics</a>, drastically changed the <!--del_lnk--> worldview of scientists, causing them to realize that the universe was fantastically more complex than previously believed, and dashing the strong hopes at the end of the 19th century that the last few details of scientific knowledge were about to be filled in. Accelerating scientific understanding, more efficient communications, and faster transportation transformed the world in those hundred years more rapidly and widely than in any previous century. It was a century that started with horses, simple automobiles, and <!--del_lnk--> freighters but ended with <!--del_lnk--> high-speed rail, <!--del_lnk--> cruise ships, global <!--del_lnk--> commercial air travel and the <!--del_lnk--> space shuttle. Horses, Western society's basic form of personal transportation for thousands of years, were replaced by automobiles and buses within the span of a few decades. These developments were made possible by the large-scale exploitation of <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> resources (especially petroleum), which offered large amounts of energy in an easily portable form, but also caused widespread concerns about pollution and long-term impact on the <!--del_lnk--> environment. Humans explored <!--del_lnk--> outer space for the first time, taking their first footsteps on the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a>.</p>
       <p>Mass media, telecommunications, and information technology (especially computers, <!--del_lnk--> paperback books, <!--del_lnk--> public education, and the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>) made the world's knowledge more widely available. Many people's view of the world changed significantly as they became much more aware of the struggles of others and, as such, became increasingly concerned with human rights. Advancements in <!--del_lnk--> medical technology also improved the welfare of many people: the global life expectancy increased from 35 years to 65 years. Rapid technological advancements, however, also allowed warfare to reach unprecedented levels of destruction. World War II alone killed over 60 million people, while <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a> gave humankind the means to annihilate or significantly harm itself in a very short period of time. The world also became more <a href="../../wp/m/Multiculturalism.htm" title="Monoculturalism">culturally homogenized</a> than ever with developments in transportation and communications technology, <!--del_lnk--> popular music and other influences of Western culture, international corporations, and what was arguably a true <!--del_lnk--> global economy by the end of the 20th century.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span></h2>
       <p>The early arms races of the century escalated into a war which involved many powerful nations: <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> (1914&ndash;1918). Technological advancements changed the way war was fought, as new inventions such as machine guns, <a href="../../wp/t/Tank.htm" title="Tank">tanks</a>, <!--del_lnk--> chemical weapons, <!--del_lnk--> grenades, and <!--del_lnk--> military aircraft modified tactics and strategy. After more than four years of <a href="../../wp/t/Trench_warfare.htm" title="Trench warfare">trench warfare</a> in western Europe, and 20 million dead, those powers who had formed the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Entente (France, Britain, and Russia, later replaced by the United States and joined by Italy) emerged victorious over the <!--del_lnk--> Central Powers (Germany, <a href="../../wp/a/Austria-Hungary.htm" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>). In addition to annexing much of the colonial possessions of the vanquished states, the Triple Entente exacted punitive restitution payments from their former foes, plunging Germany in particular into economic depression. The Tsarist regime of His Imperial Majesty <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas II was overthrown during the conflict and Russia was transitioned into the first ever communist state, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Austria-Hungary.htm" title="Austro-Hungarian">Austro-Hungarian</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> empires were dismantled at the war's conclusion.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>At the beginning of the period, <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland.htm" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">Britain</a> was the world's most powerful nation; having <!--del_lnk--> acted as the world's policeman for the past century. Fascism, a movement which grew out of post-war <!--del_lnk--> angst and which accelerated during the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Depression.htm" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s, gained momentum in Italy, Germany and Spain in the 1920s and 1930s, culminating in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> (1939&ndash;1945), sparked by <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>'s aggressive expansion at the expense of its neighbors. Meanwhile, Japan had rapidly transformed itself into a technologically advanced industrial power. Its military expansion into eastern Asia and the Pacific Ocean culminated in a surprise attack on the United States, bringing it into World War II. After having had several years of dramatic military success, Germany was defeated in 1945, having been repelled and invaded by the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> from the east and invaded from the west by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and <!--del_lnk--> Free France. The war ended with the <!--del_lnk--> dropping of two <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Atomic bombs">atomic bombs</a> on Japan. Japan later became a U.S. ally with a powerful economy based on <!--del_lnk--> consumer goods and trade. Germany was divided between the western powers and the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>; all areas recaptured by the Soviet Union (<!--del_lnk--> East Germany and eastward) were essentially transitioned into Soviet <!--del_lnk--> puppet states under communist rule. Meanwhile, western Europe was influenced by the American <a href="../../wp/m/Marshall_Plan.htm" title="Marshall Plan">Marshall Plan</a> and made a quick economic recovery, becoming major allies of the United States under capitalist economies and relatively democratic governments.</p>
       <p>World War II left about 60 million people dead. When the conflict ended in 1945, the United States and the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> emerged as very powerful nations. Allies during the war, they soon became hostile to one other as the competing ideologies of communism and <!--del_lnk--> democratic capitalism occupied Europe, divided by the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Curtain.htm" title="Iron Curtain">Iron Curtain</a> and the <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a>. The military alliances headed by these nations (<a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> in North America and western Europe; the <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Pact in eastern Europe) were prepared to wage total war with each other throughout the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> (1947&ndash;91). The period was marked by a new arms race, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a> were produced in the tens of thousands, sufficient to end most human life on the planet had a large-scale nuclear exchange ever occurred. The very size of the nuclear arsenal on both sides is believed by many historians to have staved off an inevitable war between the two, as the consequences of any attack were too great to bear. The policy of unleashing a massive nuclear attack, knowing a massive nuclear counterattack would be forthcoming, was known as <!--del_lnk--> mutually assured destruction (MAD). Although the Soviet Union and the United States never directly entered military conflict with each other, several <!--del_lnk--> proxy wars, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War (1950&ndash;1953) and the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> (1957&ndash;1975), were waged as the United States implemented its worldwide "<!--del_lnk--> containment" policy against communism.</p>

       <p>After World War II, most of the European-colonized world in Africa and Asia gained independence in a process of <!--del_lnk--> decolonization. This, and the drain of the two world wars, caused Europe to lose much of its long-held power. Meanwhile, the wars empowered several nations, including the UK, U.S., Russia, China and Japan, to exert a strong influence over many world affairs. American culture spread around the world with the advent of Hollywood, Broadway, <!--del_lnk--> rock and roll, pop music, fast food, <!--del_lnk--> big-box stores, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Rapping.htm" title="Hip-hop">hip-hop</a> lifestyle. British culture continued to influence world culture, including the "<!--del_lnk--> British Invasion" into American music, leading many top rock bands (such as Swedish <!--del_lnk--> ABBA) to sing in English. The western world and parts of Asia enjoyed a <!--del_lnk--> post-World War II economic boom. After the Soviet Union collapsed under internal pressure in 1991, the communist governments of the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern bloc were also dismantled, followed by rocky transitions into market economies.</p>
       <p>Following World War II the United Nations was established as an international forum in which the world's nations could get together and discuss issues diplomatically. It has enacted resolutions on such topics as the conduct of warfare, environmental protection, international sovereignty, and human rights. Peacekeeping forces consisting of troops provided by various countries, in concert with various United Nations and other aid agencies, have helped to relieve famine, disease, and poverty, and to suppress some local armed conflicts. Europe slowly united, economically and, in some ways, politically, into what eventually became the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, which consisted of 15 European countries by the end of the 20th century.</p>
       <p>In approximately the last third of the century, concern about humankind's impact on the Earth's <!--del_lnk--> environment caused environmentalism to become a major citizen movement. In many countries, especially in Europe, the movement was channeled into politics partly through <a href="../../wp/g/Green_party.htm" title="Green party">Green parties</a>, though awareness of the problem permeated societies. By the end of the 20th century, some progress had been made in cleaning up the environment though pollution continued apace. Increasing awareness of <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a> began in the 1980s, commencing several decades of social and political debate.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">Medical science</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Green Revolution in agriculture enabled the <a href="../../wp/w/World_population.htm" title="World population">world's population</a> to grow from about 1.6&nbsp;billion to about 6.0&nbsp;billion. This rapid population increase quickly became a major concern and directly caused or contributed to several global issues, including conflict, poverty, major <!--del_lnk--> environmental issues, and severe overcrowding in some areas.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_nature_of_innovation_and_change">The nature of innovation and change</span></h3>
       <p>Due to continuing industrialization and expanding trade, many significant changes of the century were, directly or indirectly, economic and technological in nature. Inventions such as the <!--del_lnk--> light bulb, the automobile, and the telephone in the late 19th century, followed by <!--del_lnk--> supertankers, <!--del_lnk--> airliners, motorways, radio, television, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Antibacterial.htm" title="Antibiotics">antibiotics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> frozen food, computers and <!--del_lnk--> microcomputers, the Internet, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mobile_phone.htm" title="Mobile telephone">mobile telephones</a> and many other things, affected the <!--del_lnk--> quality of life for great numbers. Scientific research, engineering professionalization and technological development was the force behind vast changes in everyday life.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Social_change">Social change</span></h3>
       <p>At the beginning of the century, discrimination based on race and sex still existed in general society. Although the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_slave_trade.htm" title="Atlantic slave trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> had ended in the 19th century, the fight for equality for Africans in the white society of North America, Europe, and South Africa continued. During the century, the social taboo of <!--del_lnk--> sexism fell. By the end of the 20th century, women had as many rights as men in most parts of the world and not only did general society accept equal rights for members of other races but most people frowned at racism. In the 1970s, the term <!--del_lnk--> speciesism was coined as people began to question humans' natural discrimination against other species. In the latter third of the century, movements for <!--del_lnk--> LGBT rights and equality for all gained significant ground in the Western world.</p>

       <p>The number of people killed during the century by government actions could be as high as 400 million. This includes deaths caused by wars, genocide, politicide and mass murders. The deaths from battles, fire bombings and nuclear bombs used during the two world wars alone has been estimated between 50 to 80 million. Political scientist <!--del_lnk--> Rudolph Rummel estimated 262,000,000 deaths caused by <!--del_lnk--> democide, which excludes those killed in war battles, civilians unitentionally killed in war and killings of rioting mobs. According to <!--del_lnk--> Charles Tilly, "Altogether, about 100 million people died as a direct result of action by organized military units backed by one government or another over the course of the century. Most likely a comparable number of civilians died of war-induced disease and other indirect effects." It is estimated that approximately 70 million Europeans died through war, violence and famine between 1914 and 1945.</p>

        <li>Rising nationalism and increasing national awareness were among the many causes of World War I (1914&ndash;1918), the first of two wars to involve many major world powers including Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Russia/<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="USSR">USSR</a>, the United States and the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. World War I led to the creation of many new countries, especially in Eastern Europe. At the time it was said by many to be the "<!--del_lnk--> war to end war".</li>
        <li>Civil wars occurred in many nations. A violent <!--del_lnk--> civil war broke out in Spain in 1936 when General <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Franco rebelled against the <!--del_lnk--> Second Spanish Republic. Many consider this war as a testing battleground for World War II, as the fascist armies bombed some Spanish territories.</li>
        <li>The economic and political aftermath of World War I and the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Depression.htm" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> in the 1930s led to the rise of fascism and <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">nazism</a> in Europe, and subsequently to World War II (1939&ndash;1945). This war also involved Asia and the Pacific, in the form of Japanese aggression against China and the United States.

        <li>The Cold War had caused an arms race and increasing competition between to the two major players in the world: the Soviet Union and USA. This competition included the development and improvement of nuclear weapons and the Space Race.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Soviet authorities caused the deaths of millions of their own citizens in order to eliminate domestic opposition. More than 18 million people passed through the <!--del_lnk--> Gulag, with a further 6 million being <!--del_lnk--> exiled to remote areas of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> civil rights movement in the United States and the movement against <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Apartheid_in_South_Africa.htm" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> in South Africa challenged racial segregation in those countries.</li>
        <li>The two world wars led to efforts to increase international cooperation, notably through the founding of the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> after World War I, and its successor, the United Nations, after World War II.</li>
        <li>Nationalist movements in the sub continent led to the independence of India and Pakistan.</li>
        <li>Gandhi's non-violence and civil disobedience influenced many political movements around the world, including the African American civil rights movement in USA, and freedom movements in South Africa and Burma.</li>
        <li>The creation of <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> in 1948, a Jewish state in the Middle East, by the <!--del_lnk--> British Mandate of Palestine fueled many regional conflicts. These were also influenced by the vast <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a> fields in many of the other countries of the mostly <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arab_people.htm" title="Arab">Arab</a> region.</li>

        <li>After a long period of civil wars and conflicts with European powers, China's last imperial dynasty ended in 1912. The resulting republic was replaced, after yet another civil war, by a communist <!--del_lnk--> People's Republic in 1949. At the end of the 20th century, though still ruled by a communist party, China's economic system had transformed almost completely to capitalism.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Great Chinese Famine was a direct cause of the death of tens of millions of Chinese peasants between 1959 and 1962.

Led mainly by students and intellectuals, the protests occurred in a year that saw the collapse of a number of communist governments around the world.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> revolutions of 1989 released Eastern and Central Europe from Soviet supremacy. Soon thereafter, the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Czechoslovakia.htm" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Yugoslavia dissolved, the latter violently over several years, into <!--del_lnk--> successor states, many rife with <!--del_lnk--> ethnic nationalism. <!--del_lnk--> East Germany and <!--del_lnk--> West Germany were reunified in 1990.</li>

        <li>Computer games and internet surfing became new and popular form of entertainment during the last 25 years of the century.</li>
        <li>In literature, science fiction, <!--del_lnk--> fantasy (with well-developed fictional worlds, rich in detail), <!--del_lnk--> alternative history fiction gained unprecedented popularity. <!--del_lnk--> Detective fiction gained unprecedented popularity between the two world wars.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Tango was created in Argentina and became extremely popular in the rest of America and Europe. <!--del_lnk--> Blues and <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a> music became popularized during the 1910s and 1920s in the United States. Blues went on to influence <!--del_lnk--> rock and roll in the 1950s, which only increased in popularity with the <!--del_lnk--> British Invasion of the mid-to-late 1960s. Rock soon branched into many different genres, including <!--del_lnk--> heavy metal, <!--del_lnk--> punk rock, and <a href="../../wp/a/Alternative_rock.htm" title="Alternative rock">alternative rock</a> and became the dominant genre of <!--del_lnk--> popular music. This was challenged with the rise of <!--del_lnk--> hip hop in the 1980s and 1990s. Other genres such as <!--del_lnk--> house, <!--del_lnk--> techno, <a href="../../wp/r/Reggae.htm" title="Reggae">reggae</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> soul all developed during the latter half of the century and went through various periods of popularity.</li>

        <li>Synthesizers began to be employed widely in music and crossed over into the mainstream with <!--del_lnk--> new wave music in the 1980s. <!--del_lnk--> Electronic instruments have been widely deployed in all manners of popular music and has led to the development of such genres as <!--del_lnk--> house, <!--del_lnk--> synthpop, electronic <!--del_lnk--> dance music, and <!--del_lnk--> industrial.</li>
        <li>The art world experienced the development of new styles and explorations such as <a href="../../wp/e/Expressionism.htm" title="Expressionism">expressionism</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Dada.htm" title="Dadaism">Dadaism</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">cubism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> de stijl, <!--del_lnk--> abstract expressionism and <!--del_lnk--> surrealism.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> modern art movement revolutionized art and culture and set the stage for both <!--del_lnk--> Modernism and its counterpart <!--del_lnk--> postmodern art as well as other contemporary art practices.</li>
        <li><a href="../../wp/a/Art_Nouveau.htm" title="Art Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> began as the most advanced architecture and design but went unfashionable after World War I. The style was very dynamic and highly inventive, however the depression of the Great War made it difficult to keep up such a high standard.</li>
        <li>In Europe, <!--del_lnk--> modern architecture departed radically from the excessive decoration of the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era. Streamlined forms inspired by machines became more commonplace, enabled by developments in <!--del_lnk--> building materials and technologies. Before World War II, many European architects moved to the United States, where modern architecture continued to develop.</li>
        <li>The automobile vastly increased the mobility of people in the Western countries in the early-to-mid-century, and in many other places by the end of the 20th century. <!--del_lnk--> City design throughout most of the West became focused on transport via car.</li>

        <li>The role of <a href="../../wp/t/Tobacco_smoking.htm" title="Tobacco smoking">tobacco smoking</a> in the causation of cancer and other diseases was proven during the 1950s (see <!--del_lnk--> British Doctors Study).</li>
        <li>New methods for cancer treatment, including <!--del_lnk--> chemotherapy, <!--del_lnk--> radiation therapy, and <!--del_lnk--> immunotherapy, were developed. As a result, cancer could often be <!--del_lnk--> cured or placed in <!--del_lnk--> remission.</li>
        <li>The development of <a href="../../wp/b/Blood_type.htm" title="Blood type">blood typing</a> and <!--del_lnk--> blood banking made <!--del_lnk--> blood transfusion safe and widely available.</li>

        <li><!--del_lnk--> Cocaine/<!--del_lnk--> crack and heroin were found to be dangerous addictive drugs, and their wide usage had been outlawed; mind-altering drugs such as <!--del_lnk--> LSD and <!--del_lnk--> MDMA were discovered and later outlawed. In many countries, a <!--del_lnk--> war on drugs caused prices to soar 10x-20x higher, leading to profitable <!--del_lnk--> black market <!--del_lnk--> drugdealing, and to prison inmate sentences being 80% related to drug use by the 1990s.</li>
        <li><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Birth_control.htm" title="Contraceptive">Contraceptive</a> drugs were developed, which reduced population growth rates in industrialized countries.</li>
        <li>The development of medical <a href="../../wp/i/Insulin.htm" title="Insulin">insulin</a> during the 1920s helped raise the life expectancy of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Diabetes_mellitus.htm" title="Diabetes">diabetics</a> to three times of what it had been earlier.</li>
        <li>As a result of some of the above developments, most notably antibiotics and vaccines, child and young people's mortality decreased drastically.</li>

       <p>By the end of the 20th century, more technological advances had been made than in all of preceding history. Communications and information technology, transportation technology, and medical advances had radically altered daily lives. Europe appeared to be at a sustainable peace for the first time in recorded history. The people of the Indian subcontinent, a sixth of the world population at the end of the 20th century, had attained an indigenous independence for the first time in centuries. China, an ancient nation comprising a fifth of the world population, was finally open to the world in a new and powerful synthesis of west and east, creating a new state after the near-complete destruction of the old cultural order. With the end of colonialism and the Cold War, nearly a billion people in Africa were left with truly independent new nation states, some cut from whole cloth, standing up after centuries of foreign domination.</p>

       <p>The world was undergoing its second major period of <a href="../../wp/g/Globalization.htm" title="Globalization">globalization</a>; the first, which started in the 18th century, having been terminated by World War I. Since the US was in a position of almost unchallenged domination, a major part of the process was <!--del_lnk--> Americanization. This led to anti-Western and <!--del_lnk--> anti-American feelings in parts of the world, especially the Middle East. The influence of China and India was also rising, as the world's largest populations, long marginalized by the West and by their own rulers, were rapidly integrating with the world economy.</p>
       <p>Terrorism, dictatorship, and the spread of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a> were some issues requiring attention. The world was still blighted by small-scale wars and other violent conflicts, fueled by competition over resources and by ethnic conflicts. <a href="../../wp/d/Despotism.htm" title="Despotism">Despots</a> such as <!--del_lnk--> Kim Jong-il of <a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> continued to lead their nations toward the development of nuclear weapons.</p>

New viruses such as <!--del_lnk--> SARS and <!--del_lnk--> West Nile continued to spread. <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">Malaria</a> and other diseases affected large populations.

       <p><a href="../../wp/w/World_population.htm" title="World population">World population</a> increased from about 1.6&nbsp;billion people in 1901 to 6.1&nbsp;billion at the century's end.
