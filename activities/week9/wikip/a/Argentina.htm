       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h3>
       <p>Argentina is derived from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>argentum</i> ("silver"). <!--del_lnk--> La Plata Basin does not have any sources of silver, but the first Spanish conquerors arrived in the area following rumors of the existence of <!--del_lnk--> silver mountains, hence the name. The first use of the name Argentina can be traced to <i><!--del_lnk--> La Argentina</i>, a 1602 poem by <!--del_lnk--> Mart&iacute;n del Barco Centenera. Although this name for the La Plata Basin was already in common usage by the 18th century, the area was formally called <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of the R&iacute;o de la Plata, and <!--del_lnk--> United Provinces of the R&iacute;o de la Plata after independence.</p>
       <p>The first formal use of the name was in the 1826 constitution, which used both the terms "Argentine Republic" and "Argentine Nation". The Constitution was repealed, and the territories were instead known as the "<!--del_lnk--> Argentine Confederation". This name was used in the 1853 Constitution, being changed to that of the "Argentine Nation" in 1859, and to the "Argentine Republic" per an 1860 decree, when the country achieved its current organization.</p>
       <p>In the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a>, the country was traditionally called "the Argentine", mimicking the typical Spanish usage <i>la Argentina</i>. This fell out of usage in English during the mid to late 20th century, and now the country is simply referred to as "Argentina".</p>

       </div>
       <p>The area now known as Argentina was relatively sparsely populated until the period of European colonization. The earliest traces of human life are dated from the <!--del_lnk--> Paleolithic period, and there are further traces in the <!--del_lnk--> Mesolithic and <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic. However, large areas of the interior and piedmont were apparently depopulated during an extensive dry period between 4000 and 2000 B.C.</p>
       <p>The Uruguayan archaeologist Ra&uacute;l Camp&aacute; Soler divided the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples in Argentina into three main groups: basic hunters and food gatherers, without development of <a href="../../wp/p/Pottery.htm" title="Pottery">pottery</a>, advanced hunters and food gatherers, and farmers with pottery. The second group could be found in the <!--del_lnk--> Pampa and south of <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia, and the third one included the <!--del_lnk--> Charr&uacute;as and <!--del_lnk--> Minuane people and the <!--del_lnk--> Guaran&iacute;es.</p>
       <p>Some of the different groups included the <!--del_lnk--> Onas at <!--del_lnk--> Tierra del Fuego, the <!--del_lnk--> Y&aacute;mana at the archipelago between the <!--del_lnk--> Beagle Channel and <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Horn.htm" title="Cape Horn">Cape Horn</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Tehuelches in the <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia, many peoples at the litoral, guaycur&uacute;es and wichis at Chaco. The <!--del_lnk--> Guaran&iacute;es had expanded across large areas of South America, but settled at the northeastern provinces of Argentina. The Toba (Komlek) nation and the Diaguita which included the Calchaqui and the Quilmes lived in the North and the Comechingones in what is today the province of Cordoba. The <!--del_lnk--> Charrua (which included the <!--del_lnk--> Minuane people), <!--del_lnk--> yaros, <!--del_lnk--> Bohanes and Chan&aacute;s (and Chan&aacute;-Timb&uacute;) were located in the actual territory of Entre R&iacute;os and the Querand&iacute; in Buenos Aires.</p>

       <p>Europeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of <!--del_lnk--> Amerigo Vespucci. The Spanish navigator <!--del_lnk--> Juan D&iacute;az de Sol&iacute;s visited the territory which is now Argentina in 1516. In 1536 <!--del_lnk--> Pedro de Mendoza established a small settlement at the modern location of <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, which was abandoned in 1541.</p>
       <p>A second one was established 1580 by <!--del_lnk--> Juan de Garay, and <!--del_lnk--> C&oacute;rdoba in 1573 by <!--del_lnk--> Jer&oacute;nimo Luis de Cabrera. Those regions were part of the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of Peru, whose capital was Lima, and settlers arrived from that city. Unlike the other regions of South America, the colonization of the R&iacute;o de la Plata estuary was not influenced by any <!--del_lnk--> gold rush, since it lacked any <!--del_lnk--> precious metals to mine.</p>
       <p>The first European explorer, <!--del_lnk--> Juan D&iacute;az de Sol&iacute;s, arrived on the R&iacute;o de la Plata in 1516. Spain established the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of Peru, encompassing all its holdings in South America. <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> was established in 1536 but was destroyed by natives. The city was established again in 1580. The colonization of modern Argentina came from 3 different directions: from Paraguay, establishing the <!--del_lnk--> Governorate of the R&iacute;o de la Plata, from Peru and from Chile.</p>
       <p>The natural ports on the <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o de la Plata <!--del_lnk--> estuary could not be used because all ships were meant to be made through the port of <!--del_lnk--> Callao near <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a>, a condition that led to <!--del_lnk--> contraband becoming the normal means of commerce in cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Asunci&oacute;n, <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Montevideo.htm" title="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>.</p>
       <p>The Spanish raised the status of this region by establishing the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of the R&iacute;o de la Plata in 1776. This viceroyalty consisted of today's Argentina, <a href="../../wp/u/Uruguay.htm" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Paraguay.htm" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, as well as much of present-day <a href="../../wp/b/Bolivia.htm" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>. Buenos Aires, now holding the customs of the new political subdivision, became a flourishing port, as the revenues from the <!--del_lnk--> Potos&iacute;, the increasing maritime activity in terms of goods rather than <!--del_lnk--> precious metals, the production of <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a> for the <!--del_lnk--> export of <!--del_lnk--> leather and other products, and other political reasons, made it gradually become one of the most important commercial centers of the region.</p>
       <p>The viceroyalty was, however, short-lived due to lack of internal cohesion among the many regions of which it was constituted and lack of Spanish support. Ships from Spain became scarce again after the Spanish defeat at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Trafalgar.htm" title="Battle of Trafalgar">battle of Trafalgar</a>, that gave the British maritime supremacy. The British tried to <!--del_lnk--> invade Buenos Aires and Montevideo in 1806 and 1807, but were defeated both times by <!--del_lnk--> Santiago de Liniers. Those victories, achieved without help from mainland Spain, boosted the confidence of the city.</p>
       <p>The beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> Peninsular War in Spain and the capture of the Spanish king <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand VII created great concern all around the viceroyalty. It was considered that, without a King, people in America should rule themselves. This idea led to multiple attempts to remove the local authorities at <!--del_lnk--> Chuquisaca, <!--del_lnk--> La Paz, Montevideo and <!--del_lnk--> Buenos Aires, all of which were short-lived. A new successful attempt, the <!--del_lnk--> May Revolution, took place when it was reported that all of Spain had been conquered, with the only exception of C&aacute;diz and Le&oacute;n.</p>
       <p>Buenos Aires became the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of the R&iacute;o de la Plata in 1776, with territories from the Viceroyalty of Peru. Buenos Aires and Montevideo resisted <!--del_lnk--> two ill-fated British invasions in 1806 and 1807. The resistance was headed both times by the French <!--del_lnk--> Santiago de Liniers, who would become <!--del_lnk--> viceroy through popular support. The ideas of the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> and the example of the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Revolutions generated criticism to the <!--del_lnk--> Absolute monarchy. The overthrow of the Spanish King <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand VII during the <!--del_lnk--> Peninsular War created great concern in the Americas, so many cities deposed the monarchic authorities and appointed new ones, working under the new political ideas. This started the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish American wars of independence across the continent. Buenos Aires deposed the viceroy <!--del_lnk--> Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros in 1810, during the <!--del_lnk--> May Revolution.</p>

       <p>The May Revolution of 1810 began the Argentine War of Independence between <!--del_lnk--> patriots and <!--del_lnk--> royalists. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Primera Junta</i>, the new government in Buenos Aires, sent military campaigns to <!--del_lnk--> C&oacute;rdoba, <!--del_lnk--> Upper Peru and <!--del_lnk--> Paraguay, and supported the rebellions at the <i><!--del_lnk--> Banda Oriental</i>. The military campaigns were defeated, so Buenos Aires signed an armistice with Montevideo. Paraguay stayed <!--del_lnk--> Non-interventionist during the remainder of the conflict, Upper Peru defeated further military campaigns, and the <i>Banda Oriental</i> would be captured by <!--del_lnk--> William Brown during renewed hostilities. The national organization, either under a <!--del_lnk--> centralized government located in Buenos Aires or as a federation, began the Argentine Civil Wars as well, with the conflicts of Buenos Aires and <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Gervasio Artigas.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Declaration of Independence was issued by the <!--del_lnk--> Congress of Tucum&aacute;n in 1816. <!--del_lnk--> Mart&iacute;n Miguel de G&uuml;emes kept royalists at bay on the North, while <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; de San Mart&iacute;n made the <!--del_lnk--> Crossing of the Andes, securing the independence of Chile. With the Chilean navy at his disposal he then <!--del_lnk--> took the fight to the royalist stronghold of <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a>. San Mart&iacute;n's military campaigns complemented those of <!--del_lnk--> Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var in <!--del_lnk--> Gran Colombia and led to the independent's victory in the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish American wars of independence.</p>
       <p>The 1820 <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Cepeda, fought between the <!--del_lnk--> Centralists and the <!--del_lnk--> Federalists, resulted in the end of the <!--del_lnk--> centralized national authority. A new centralist constitution was enacted in 1826, during the <!--del_lnk--> War with Brazil, and <!--del_lnk--> Bernardino Rivadavia was appointed the first <!--del_lnk--> President of Argentina. It was rejected by the provinces, forcing Rivadavia to resign. The new governor <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Dorrego was deposed and executed by <!--del_lnk--> Juan Lavalle, which exacerbated the civil war. <!--del_lnk--> Juan Manuel de Rosas organized the resistance against Lavalle and restored the deposed authorities. The provinces then reorganized themselves as a loose <!--del_lnk--> confederation of provinces that lacked a common head of state. They would instead delegate some important powers to the <!--del_lnk--> governor of Buenos Aires Province, such as debt payment or the management of international relations.</p>

       <p>Juan Manuel de Rosas ruled from 1829 to 1832, and from 1835 to 1852. During his first term he convened the <!--del_lnk--> Federal pact and defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Unitarian League. After 1835 he received the "<!--del_lnk--> Sum of public power". He faced several a <!--del_lnk--> French blockade from 1838 to 1840, the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Confederation in the north, an <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-French blockade from 1845 to 1850, and the Corrientes province revolt. Rosas remained undefeated during this series of conflicts and prevented further loss of national territory. His refusal to enact a national constitution, pursuant to the Federal pact, led to Entre R&iacute;os governor <!--del_lnk--> Justo Jos&eacute; de Urquiza to <!--del_lnk--> turn against Rosas and sanction the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Argentina of 1853. Rejecting it, Buenos Aires seceded from the Confederation and became the <!--del_lnk--> State of Buenos Aires. The <!--del_lnk--> war between both lasted nearly a decade, and ended with the victory of Buenos Aires at the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Pav&oacute;n.</p>
       <p>Buenos Aires rejoined the Confederation, and <!--del_lnk--> Bartolom&eacute; Mitre was elected the first president of the unified country in 1862. He began military campaigns against both the remaining federals in Argentina, the <!--del_lnk--> whites from Uruguay, and Paraguay. The <!--del_lnk--> War of the Triple Alliance, in alliance with Uruguay and Brazil, left over 300,000 dead and devastated Paraguay. Unable to influence the election of later presidents, <!--del_lnk--> Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and <!--del_lnk--> Nicol&aacute;s Avellaneda followed him. Albeit unitarians, they were not from Buenos Aires, and had conflicts with him. Mitre attempted twice to secede Buenos Aires from the country once more, but failed. Avellaneda <!--del_lnk--> federalized Buenos Aires, after defeating a final failed attempt to secede it.</p>
       <p>Since the colonial times, huge territories were under the control of <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples. All governments since then attempted in some way to stay in good terms, kill them, or push them to ever farther frontiers. The final conflict was the <!--del_lnk--> Conquest of the Desert, waged by <!--del_lnk--> Julio Argentino Roca in the 1870s. With this military operation, Argentina seized control of <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia.</p>

They founded a political movement known as <!--del_lnk--> Peronism, still strong in the country.</div>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The bases of modern Argentina were established by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Generation of '80</i>, a political movement that opposed Mitre and sought to industrialize the country. A wave of <!--del_lnk--> European immigration led to the strengthening of a cohesive state, the development of modern agriculture and to a near-reinvention of Argentine society and economy. The country emerged as one of the ten richest countries in the world, benefiting from an agricultural export-led economy as well as British and French investment. Driven by immigration and decreasing mortality the Argentine population grew fivefold and the economy 15-fold. However, the <!--del_lnk--> National Autonomist Party (PAN) could not meet its original goals of industrialization, and the country stayed as a <!--del_lnk--> pre-industrial society. President <!--del_lnk--> Ju&aacute;rez Celman faced an economic crisis that generated popular discontent and the <!--del_lnk--> Revolution of the Park in 1890, led by the <!--del_lnk--> Civic Union. With the resignation of Mitre, the Civic Union became the <!--del_lnk--> Radical Civic Union (UCR). Although the Coup d'&eacute;tat failed, Celman resigned from the presidency, starting the decline of the PAN. Conservative &eacute;lites dominated Argentine politics until 1912, when President <!--del_lnk--> Roque S&aacute;enz Pe&ntilde;a enacted <!--del_lnk--> universal male suffrage and the <!--del_lnk--> secret ballot. This allowed the UCR to win the country's first free elections in 1916. President <!--del_lnk--> Hip&oacute;lito Yrigoyen enacted social and economic reforms and extended assistance to family farmers and <!--del_lnk--> small businesses. Argentina stayed <!--del_lnk--> neutral during World War I.</p>
       <p>The second administration of Yrigoyen faced a huge economic crisis, influenced by the international <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Depression.htm" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. The military made a <!--del_lnk--> coup d'&eacute;tat and ousted him from power, which began the <i><!--del_lnk--> Infamous Decade</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; F&eacute;lix Uriburu led the military rule for two years. <!--del_lnk--> Agust&iacute;n Pedro Justo was elected with electoral fraud, and signed the <!--del_lnk--> Roca-Runciman Treaty. <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Mar&iacute;a Ortiz and <!--del_lnk--> Ram&oacute;n Castillo <!--del_lnk--> stayed neutral during World War II. Britain supported the Argentine neutrality, but after the <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbour</a> the United States requested all of South America to join the <!--del_lnk--> Allied Nations. Castillo was finally deposed by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Revolution of '43</i>, a new military coup that wanted to end the electoral fraud of the last decade. Argentina declared war to the Axis Powers a month before the <!--del_lnk--> end of World War II in Europe. The minister of welfare of the military, <!--del_lnk--> Juan Per&oacute;n, became highly popular among workers. He was fired and jailed, but a <!--del_lnk--> massive demonstration forced his liberation. Per&oacute;n <!--del_lnk--> ran for the presidency in 1946, and won by 53.1%.</p>
       <p>The Argentine military, as has been the tendency in other Latin American countries, were considerably more influential in former times. Starting in 1930 and throughout the 20th century, democratic governments were more often than not interrupted by military <!--del_lnk--> coups (see <!--del_lnk--> History of Argentina). The terrible consequences of the last dictatorship destroyed the military image as the <i>moral reserve</i> of the nation and opened the way to transform them to into today's armed forces.</p>
       <p>Granaderos, the cavalry unit that, among other feats, followed San Mart&iacute;n across the Andes in 1817 to liberate Chile and Peru.</p>
       <p>Juan Per&oacute;n created a political movement known as <!--del_lnk--> Peronism. Taking advantage of the <!--del_lnk--> import substitution industrialization and the European devastation left by the immediate <!--del_lnk--> aftermath of World War II, he <!--del_lnk--> nationalized strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full <!--del_lnk--> external debt and achieved nearly <!--del_lnk--> full employment. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950. His wife <!--del_lnk--> Eva Per&oacute;n was highly popular and played a central political role, mostly through the <!--del_lnk--> Eva Per&oacute;n Foundation, where she developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society in Argentina. Also provided assistance to countries of South America and she brought food and clothing to Europe, during the European Tour of Eva in 1947. The <!--del_lnk--> Female Peronist Party, as <!--del_lnk--> women's suffrage was granted in 1947. However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. The military began to plot against Per&oacute;n in 1955, and <!--del_lnk--> bombed the Plaza de Mayo in an ill-fated attempt to kill him. A few months later, Per&oacute;n resigned during a new military coup, which established the <i><!--del_lnk--> Revoluci&oacute;n Libertadora</i>. Per&oacute;n left the country, and finally settled in Spain.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Pedro Eugenio Aramburu <!--del_lnk--> proscribed Peronism and banned all manifestations of it. Peronism, however, did not disappear, as Peronists kept being organized in informal associations. The 1949 amendment of the Constitution was repealed, restoring the one of 1853; but the elections for the Constituent Assembly obtained a majority of <!--del_lnk--> blank votes because of the Peronist proscription. <!--del_lnk--> Arturo Frondizi from the UCR became popular by opposing the military rule, and got elected in the following elections. The military, however, was reluctant to allow Peronism to influence the new government, and allowed him to take power on condition he stayed aligned with them. The military frequently interfered on behalf of conservative, agrarian interests however, and the results were mixed. His policies encouraged investment to make the country self-sufficient in energy and industry, helping reverse a chronic <!--del_lnk--> trade deficit for Argentina. His efforts to stay on good terms with both Peronists and the military, without fully supporting either one, earned him the distrust and rejection of both. Frondizi lifted the Peronist proscription, leading to a Peronist victory in several provinces, rejected by the military. A new coup ousted him from power, but a swift reaction by <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Guido (president of the Senate) applied the laws related to <!--del_lnk--> power vacuums and became president instead of the military. The elections were repealed and Peronism proscribed again. <!--del_lnk--> Arturo Illia was elected in 1963 but, despite prosperity, his attempts to include Peronists in the political process resulted in the armed forces retaking power in a coup in 1966. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Argentine Revolution</i>, the new military government, sought to rule in Argentina indefinitely.</p>
       <p>The new military Junta appointed <!--del_lnk--> Juan Carlos Ongan&iacute;a as president. He closed the Congress, banned all political parties and dismantled all student unions and many worker unions. Popular discontent led to two massive protests in 1969, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Cordobazo</i> in C&oacute;rdoba and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Rosariazo</i> in Rosario. In May 1970, the <!--del_lnk--> Montoneros kidnapped and executed the former de facto president, Aramburu. There was a public outcry against this crime. Ongan&iacute;a was replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Roberto M. Levingston in June 1970.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Montoneros and the <!--del_lnk--> People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), commenced <!--del_lnk--> Guerrilla warfare against the military, ultimately resulting in 6,000 casualties. This, in turn, led to the military reacting with the <!--del_lnk--> Dirty War, in which 10,000 people "disappeared", including some guerillas.</p>
       <p>In March 1971, Levingston was then replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro Agust&iacute;n Lanusse, who began negotiations to return to democracy and end the proscription of Peronism. Initially, he sought to allow Peronism but not the return of Juan Per&oacute;n himself (who was living in Spain) with an agreement stipulating presidential candidates reside in Argentina as of 25 August. Thus, the Peronist candidate was not Per&oacute;n but <!--del_lnk--> H&eacute;ctor Jos&eacute; C&aacute;mpora, who won the elections by the 49.59%.</p>

       <p>The return of Peronism to power saw violent disputes between its internal factions: right-wing union leaders and left-wing youth from Montoneros. The return of Per&oacute;n to the country in June 1973 generated an armed conflict, the <!--del_lnk--> Ezeiza massacre. Overwhelmed by political violence, C&aacute;mpora and his vice-president resigned, promoting new elections so Per&oacute;n could become president. Per&oacute;n was elected, with his wife <!--del_lnk--> Isabel as vice-president. Before Peron took office the Montoneros murdered the union leader <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Ignacio Rucci, with close ties to Per&oacute;n. Per&oacute;n <!--del_lnk--> expelled them from Plaza de Mayo and from the party, and they became once again a clandestine organization. <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; L&oacute;pez Rega organized the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA) to fight against them and the ERP. Per&oacute;n died in July 1974. His wife succeeded him. The AAA maintained operations against the guerrillas, which increased their power. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Operativo Independencia</i> stopped a guerilla attempt to capture and secede territories of Tucum&aacute;n from Argentina. A decree ordered the military to "annihilate the subversion". The military made another <!--del_lnk--> coup d'&eacute;tat, in March 1976.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> National Reorganization Process closed the Congress, removed the members of the Supreme Court, and banned political parties, unions, student unions, etc. It also intensified measures against the ERP and the Montoneros, who had kidnapped and murdered people almost weekly since 1970. The military resorted to the <!--del_lnk--> forced disappearance of suspected members of the guerrillas, and began to prevail in the war. The losses of Montoneros by the end of 1976 were near 2000. The Junta tried to increase its popularity with the <!--del_lnk--> Beagle conflict and the <!--del_lnk--> 1978 FIFA World Cup. As of 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. Montoneros was severely weakened, but launched a massive counterattack in 1979. It was defeated, ending the guerrilla threat, but the military Junta stayed in government. <!--del_lnk--> Leopoldo Galtieri launched the <!--del_lnk--> Falklands War (<a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>: <span lang="es"><i>Guerra de Malvinas</i></span>), attempting to annex the islands, but within two months Argentina was defeated by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> which considered the islands to be part of its own overseas territory. Galtieri left the government because of the military defeat, and <!--del_lnk--> Reynaldo Bignone began to organize the transition to democratic rule, with the <!--del_lnk--> free elections in 1983.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In the 1983 electoral campaign Alfons&iacute;n called to national unity, restoration of democratic rule and prosecution of those responsible for the dirty war. He established the <!--del_lnk--> National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) to investigate the forced disappearances. The CONADEP generated a report detailing 340 centers of illegal detentions and 8961 forced disappearances. The 1985 <!--del_lnk--> Trial of the Juntas sentenced all the heads of government of those years. Alfons&iacute;n aimed then to the military of lower ranks, but the discontent among the military and the risk of a new coup increased. To please them, he issued the <!--del_lnk--> full stop law, which established a deadline for new trials. This did not work as intended, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Carapintadas</i> mutinied, forcing the <!--del_lnk--> law of Due Obedience that exempted the military that followed orders from superior ranks. This reduced public support for the government, as well as an economic crisis that led to an <!--del_lnk--> hyperinflation. The Peronist <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Menem won the 1989 elections, but <!--del_lnk--> riots caused by the economic crisis forced Alfons&iacute;n to resign, handing government to Menem.</p>
       <p>Carlos Menem led a change in Peronism, which declined its usual politics and embraced <!--del_lnk--> neoliberalism instead. A <!--del_lnk--> fixed exchange rate established in 1991, the dismantling of <!--del_lnk--> protectionist barriers, business <!--del_lnk--> regulations and several <!--del_lnk--> privatizations normalized the economy for a time. His victories at the 1991 and 1993 elections led to the <!--del_lnk--> 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution, which allowed him to run for a second term. He was reelected, but the economy began to decline in 1996, with higher unemployment and recession. He lost the 1997 elections, and the UCR returned to the presidency in the 1999 elections.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>President <!--del_lnk--> Fernando de la R&uacute;a sought to change the political style of Menem, but kept his economic plan regardless of the growing recession. He appointed <!--del_lnk--> Domingo Cavallo, who had already been minister of economy during the presidency of Menem. The social discontent led to the appearance of <i><!--del_lnk--> piqueteros</i> and huge blank votes in the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 legislative elections. A huge <!--del_lnk--> capital flight was responded to with a <!--del_lnk--> freezing of bank accounts, generating further discontent. Several riots in the country led the president to establish a <!--del_lnk--> state of emergency, received with more <!--del_lnk--> popular protests. The <!--del_lnk--> huge riots in December finally forced De la R&uacute;a to resign.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Duhalde was appointed president by the Legislative Assembly, and derogated the fixed exchange rate established by Menem. The economic crisis began to end by the late 2002, under the management of the minister of Economy <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Lavagna. The death of two <i>piqueteros</i> caused a political scandal that forced Duhalde to call to elections earlier. Carlos Menem got the majority of the votes, followed by <!--del_lnk--> N&eacute;stor Kirchner. Kirchner was largely unknown by the people, but would maintain Lavagna as minister. However, Menem declined to run for the required <!--del_lnk--> ballotage, which made Kirchner the new president.</p>

       <p>Following the economic policies laid by Duhalde and Lavagna, Kirchner ended the economic crisis, getting fiscal and trade surpluses. However, he distanced from Duhalde once getting to power. He promoted as well the reopening of judicial actions against the crimes of the Dirty War. During his administration, Argentina <!--del_lnk--> restructured its defaulted debt with a steep discount (about 66%) on most bonds, paid off debts with the <!--del_lnk--> International Monetary Fund and nationalized some previously privatized enterprises. He did not run for a reelection, promoting instead the candidacy of his wife <!--del_lnk--> Cristina Fern&aacute;ndez de Kirchner.</p>
       <p>The presidency of Cristina Kirchner began with a <!--del_lnk--> conflict with the agricultural sector, caused by an attempt to increase the taxes over exports. The conflict was taken to the Congress, and vice-president <!--del_lnk--> Julio Cobos gave an unexpected tie-breaking vote against the bill. The government waged several <!--del_lnk--> controversies with the press, limiting the <!--del_lnk--> freedom of speech. N&eacute;stor Kirchner <!--del_lnk--> died in 2010, and Cristina Fern&aacute;ndez was reelected in 2011.</p>
       <p>Same-sex marriage in Argentina has been legal since July 22, 2010. A bill for legalization was approved on May 5, 2010, by the <!--del_lnk--> Chamber of Deputies, and on July 15, 2010, by the <!--del_lnk--> Senate. <!--del_lnk--> President <!--del_lnk--> Cristina Fern&aacute;ndez de Kirchner signed it on July 21. On July 22, the law was published in the Official Gazette. Argentina became the first country in Latin America and the second in the Americas to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. It was the tenth country to allow <!--del_lnk--> same-sex marriage.</p>

       <p>Argentina is situated in <!--del_lnk--> southern South America, with the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> on the west and the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">South Atlantic Ocean</a> to the east and south. Argentina has a total surface area (excluding the Antarctic claim and areas controlled by the United Kingdom) of 2,780,400 km<sup>2</sup> (1,073,500&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi); of this, 43,710&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (16,880&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), or 1.57%, is water. Argentina has six main <!--del_lnk--> regions. The <!--del_lnk--> Pampas are fertile lowlands located in the centre and east. The <!--del_lnk--> Mesopotamia is a lowland enclosed by the <!--del_lnk--> Paran&aacute; and <!--del_lnk--> Uruguay rivers, and the <!--del_lnk--> Gran Chaco is between the mesopotamia and the Andes. <!--del_lnk--> Cuyo is at the east side of the Andes, and the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Northwest is at the North of it. The <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia is a large plateau to the south.</p>
       <p>The highest point above sea level is in the Mendoza province at Cerro <!--del_lnk--> Aconcagua (6,959&nbsp;m (22,831&nbsp;ft)), also the highest point in the <!--del_lnk--> Southern and <!--del_lnk--> Western Hemisphere. The lowest point is <!--del_lnk--> Laguna del Carb&oacute;n in Santa Cruz province, &minus;105&nbsp;m (&minus;344&nbsp;ft) below sea level. This is also the lowest point in South America. The easternmost continental point is northeast of <!--del_lnk--> Bernardo de Irigoyen, Misiones, the westernmost in the <!--del_lnk--> Perito Moreno National Park in Santa Cruz province. The northernmost point is at the confluence of the <!--del_lnk--> Grande de San Juan and Mojinete rivers in Jujuy province, and the southernmost is Cape San P&iacute;o in Tierra del Fuego.</p>
       <p>The major rivers are the <!--del_lnk--> Paran&aacute; (the largest), the <!--del_lnk--> Pilcomayo, <!--del_lnk--> Paraguay, <!--del_lnk--> Bermejo, <!--del_lnk--> Colorado, <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o Negro, <!--del_lnk--> Salado and the <!--del_lnk--> Uruguay. The Paran&aacute; and the Uruguay join to form the <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o de la Plata estuary, before reaching the Atlantic. Regionally important rivers are the <!--del_lnk--> Atuel and <!--del_lnk--> Mendoza in the homonymous province, the <!--del_lnk--> Chubut in Patagonia, the R&iacute;o Grande in Jujuy and the San Francisco River in Salta.</p>
       <p>The 4,725&nbsp;km (2,936&nbsp;mi) long Atlantic coast varies between areas of sand dunes and cliffs. The continental platform, the <!--del_lnk--> Patagonian Shelf, is unusually wide; this shallow area of the Atlantic is called the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Sea. The two major ocean currents affecting the coast are the warm <!--del_lnk--> Brazil Current and the cold <!--del_lnk--> Falkland Current. Because of the unevenness of the coastal landmass, the two currents alternate in their influence on climate and do not allow temperatures to fall evenly with higher latitude. The southern coast of Tierra del Fuego forms the north shore of the <!--del_lnk--> Beagle Channel.</p>

       <p>The generally <!--del_lnk--> temperate climate ranges from <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Subtropics.htm" title="Subtropical climate">subtropical</a> in the north to <!--del_lnk--> subpolar in the far south. The north is characterized by very hot, humid summers with mild drier winters, and is subject to periodic droughts. Central Argentina has a temperate climate, with hot summers with thunderstorms, and cool winters; and higher moisture at the east. The southern regions have warm summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall, especially in mountainous zones.</p>
       <p>Major wind currents include the cool <!--del_lnk--> Pampero Winds blowing on the flat plains of Patagonia and the <i>Pampas</i>; following the cold front, warm currents blow from the north in middle and late winter, creating mild conditions. The <!--del_lnk--> Zonda, a <!--del_lnk--> hot dry wind, affects west-central Argentina. Squeezed of all moisture during the 6,000&nbsp;m (19,685&nbsp;ft) descent from the Andes, Zonda winds can blow for hours with gusts up to 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph), fueling wildfires and causing damage; when the Zonda blows (June&ndash;November), snowstorms and <!--del_lnk--> blizzard (<i>viento blanco</i>) conditions usually affect higher elevations. The <!--del_lnk--> Sudestada usually moderates cold temperatures but brings very heavy rains, rough seas and coastal flooding. It is most common in late autumn and winter along the central coast and in the R&iacute;o de la Plata estuary.</p>

       <p>Subtropical plants dominate the Gran Chaco in the north, with the <!--del_lnk--> Dalbergia <a href="../../wp/g/Genus.htm" title="Genus">genus</a> of trees well represented by <i>Brazilian Rosewood</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> quebracho tree</i>; also predominant are white and black <i><!--del_lnk--> algarrobo</i> trees (<!--del_lnk--> prosopis alba and <!--del_lnk--> prosopis nigra). Savannah-like areas exist in the drier regions nearer the Andes. In central Argentina the <i>humid pampas</i> are a true <!--del_lnk--> tallgrass prairie <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem. The original pampa had virtually no trees; the only tree-like plant native to the pampa is the evergreen <!--del_lnk--> Omb&uacute;. The pampa is one of the most agriculturally productive on Earth; however, this is also responsible for decimating much of the original ecosystem, to make way for commercial agriculture. The western pampas receive less rainfall, this <i>dry pampa</i> is a plain of short grasses or <!--del_lnk--> steppe. The national government maintains 4 <!--del_lnk--> natural monuments and 33 <!--del_lnk--> national parks.</p>
       <p>Prominent animals from the subtropical north include <!--del_lnk--> big cats like the <!--del_lnk--> jaguar, Most of Patagonia lies within the <!--del_lnk--> rain shadow of the Andes, so the flora, shrubby bushes and plants, is suited to dry conditions. The soil is hard and rocky, making large-scale farming impossible except along river valleys. <!--del_lnk--> Coniferous forests in far western Patagonia and on the island of Tierra del Fuego, include <!--del_lnk--> alerce, <!--del_lnk--> cipr&eacute;s de la cordillera, <!--del_lnk--> cipr&eacute;s de las guaitecas, <!--del_lnk--> huililahu&aacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> lleuque, <!--del_lnk--> ma&ntilde;&iacute;o hembra and <!--del_lnk--> pehu&eacute;n, while broadleaf trees include several species of <i><!--del_lnk--> Nothofagus</i> such as <!--del_lnk--> coihue, <!--del_lnk--> lenga and <!--del_lnk--> &ntilde;ire. Other introduced trees present in forestry plantations include <!--del_lnk--> spruce, <!--del_lnk--> cypress and <a href="../../wp/p/Pine.htm" title="Pine">pine</a>. Common plants are the <!--del_lnk--> copihue and <!--del_lnk--> colihue.</p>
       <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Cuyo, semiarid thorny bushes and other <!--del_lnk--> xerophile plants abound. Along the many rivers grasses and trees grow in significant numbers. The area presents optimal conditions for the large scale growth of <!--del_lnk--> grape vines. In northwest Argentina there are many species of <a href="../../wp/c/Cactus.htm" title="Cactus">cactus</a>.</p>
       <p>Prominent animals from the subtropical north include <!--del_lnk--> big cats like the <!--del_lnk--> jaguar, <!--del_lnk--> puma, and <!--del_lnk--> ocelot; primates (<!--del_lnk--> howler monkey); large reptiles (<a href="../../wp/c/Crocodile.htm" title="Crocodile">crocodiles</a>), the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Black and White Tegu and a species of <!--del_lnk--> caiman.

There are also <!--del_lnk--> pampas deer and <!--del_lnk--> pampas foxes. Some of these species extend into Patagonia.</p>
       <p>The western mountains are home to different animals. These include the <!--del_lnk--> llama, <!--del_lnk--> guanaco, <!--del_lnk--> vicu&ntilde;a, among the most recognizable species of South America. Also in this region are the fox, <!--del_lnk--> viscacha, <!--del_lnk--> Andean Mountain Cat, <!--del_lnk--> kodkod, and the largest flying bird in the New World, the <!--del_lnk--> Andean Condor.</p>
       <p>Southern Argentina is home to the cougar, <!--del_lnk--> huemul, <!--del_lnk--> pud&uacute; (the world's smallest deer), and introduced, non-native <!--del_lnk--> wild boar.

Argentina ranks third in South America in total population and 33rd globally. Population density is of 15 persons per square kilometer of land area, well below the world average of 50 persons. The population growth rate in 2010 was an estimated 1.03% annually, with a birth rate of 17.7 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants. The <!--del_lnk--> net migration rate has ranged from zero to four immigrants per 1,000 inhabitants.</p>
       <p>The proportion of people under 15 is 25.6%, somewhat below the world average of 28%, and the proportion of people 65 and older is relatively high at 10.8%. In Latin America this is second only to <a href="../../wp/u/Uruguay.htm" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> and well above the world average, which is currently 7%. Argentina has one of Latin America's lowest <!--del_lnk--> population growth rates, recently about 1% a year, as well as a comparatively low <!--del_lnk--> infant mortality rate.

       <p>As with other areas of new settlement such as <!--del_lnk--> Canada, <!--del_lnk--> Australia, and the <!--del_lnk--> United States, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants. Most Argentines are descended from colonial-era settlers, and 19th and 20th century immigrants from Europe. During the 18th and 19th centuries especially, Argentina was second only to the US in the numbers of European immigrants received and, at those times, the national population doubled every two decades. The majority of these European immigrants came from <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>,. Argentina is home to a significant population of <!--del_lnk--> Arabic and partial Arabic background. The <!--del_lnk--> Asian population is the country numbers at around 180,000 individuals, most of whom are of <!--del_lnk--> Chinese descent.</p>
       <p>Recent <!--del_lnk--> Illegal immigration has mostly been coming from Bolivia and Paraguay, with smaller numbers from <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>, Ecuador and <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a>. The Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program to encourage illegal immigrants to declare their status in return for two-year residence visas&mdash;&mdash;so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Language">Language</span></h3>
       <p>The <i>de facto</i> official language of Argentina is Spanish, usually called <i>castellano</i> (Castilian) by Argentines. Argentina is the largest <!--del_lnk--> Spanish-speaking society that universally employs <i><!--del_lnk--> voseo</i> (the use of the <!--del_lnk--> pronoun <i>vos</i> instead of <i>t&uacute;</i> (you), which occasions the use of alternate verb forms as well). The most prevalent dialect is <!--del_lnk--> Rioplatense, whose speakers are primarily located in the <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o de la Plata basin. Italian and other European immigrants influenced <i><!--del_lnk--> Lunfardo</i>, the slang spoken in the region, permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other regions as well. A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of <!--del_lnk--> CONICET and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Toronto showed that the accent of the inhabitants of Buenos Aires (known as <i><!--del_lnk--> porte&ntilde;os</i>) is closer to the <!--del_lnk--> Neapolitan language, spoken in Southern Italy, than any other spoken language.</p>
       <p>According to Ethnologue there are around 1.5&nbsp;million Italian speakers (making it the second most spoken language in the country) and 1 million speakers of the North <!--del_lnk--> Levantine dialect of Arabic (spoken in Syria, Lebanon and Cyprus). <!--del_lnk--> Standard German is spoken by 400,000&mdash;500,000 Argentines of German ancestry, making it the fourth most spoken language.</p>

       <p>The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion but also requires the government to support Roman Catholicism economically. Catholic policy remains influential in government though, and still helps shape a variety of legislation. In a study assessing world-wide levels of religious regulation and persecution, with scores ranging from 0&ndash;10 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or persecution, Argentina received a score of 1.4 on Government Regulation of Religion, 6.0 on Social Regulation of Religion, 6.9 on Government Favoritism of Religion and 6 on Religious Persecution.</p>
       <p>According to the World Christian Database Argentines are: 92.1% Christian, 3.1% agnostic, 1.9% Muslim, 1.3% Jewish, 0.9% atheist, and 0.9% Buddhist and others. Argentine Christians are mostly Roman Catholic with estimates for the number of Catholics varying from 70% to 90% of the population (though perhaps only 20% attend services regularly). On March 13, 2013, Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, becoming the first pope from the <!--del_lnk--> New World. He took the name <a href="../../wp/p/Pope_Francis.htm" title="Pope Francis">Pope Francis</a>.</p>
       <p>Argentina has the largest Jewish population of any country in Latin America. A recent study found that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious (which includes those who believe in God but do not follow a religion), 4% are agnostics and 5% are <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheist">atheist</a>. Overall 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group with a majority of followers who regularly attended services.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Argentina is a <!--del_lnk--> constitutional republic and <!--del_lnk--> representative democracy. The government is regulated by a system of <!--del_lnk--> checks and balances defined by the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Argentina, which serves as the country's supreme legal document. The <!--del_lnk--> seat of government is the city of <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, such location is regulated by the Congress. Suffrage is <!--del_lnk--> universal, <!--del_lnk--> equal, <!--del_lnk--> secret and <!--del_lnk--> mandatory.</p>
       <p>The national government is composed of three branches:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Legislative: The <!--del_lnk--> bicameral <!--del_lnk--> Congress, made up of the <!--del_lnk--> Senate and the <!--del_lnk--> Chamber of Deputies, makes <!--del_lnk--> federal law, <!--del_lnk--> declares war, approves treaties, has the <!--del_lnk--> power of the purse, and has the power of <!--del_lnk--> impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.</li>
        <li>Executive: The <!--del_lnk--> president is the <!--del_lnk--> commander-in-chief of the military, can veto <!--del_lnk--> legislative bills before they become law, and appoints the members of the Cabinet and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Judicial: The <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find <!--del_lnk--> unconstitutional.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The Chamber of Deputies has 257 voting members, each representing a province for a four-year term. Seats are apportioned among the provinces by population every tenth year. As of 2012, ten provinces have just five deputies, while the <!--del_lnk--> Buenos Aires Province, the most populous province, has 70. The Senate has 72 members with each province having three senators, elected <!--del_lnk--> at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. A third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice in a row. The president is elected by <!--del_lnk--> direct vote. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The Supreme Court has seven members appointed by the President in consultation with the Senate. The judges of all the other courts are appointed by the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Magistrates of the Nation, a secretariat composed of representatives of judges, lawyers, the Congress and the executive.</p>
       <p>The provincial governments must be representative republics and may not contradict the national constitution and national laws, but beyond that, each province is allowed to have its own constitution and organize their local government as desired. For example, some provinces have bicameral provincial legislatures, while others have <!--del_lnk--> unicameral ones. <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> is not a province but a <!--del_lnk--> federal district, but its local organization has similarities with the provinces: it has a local constitution, an elected mayor and representatives to the Senate and the Chamber of deputies. The national government reserved control of the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Federal Police (the federally administered city force), the <!--del_lnk--> Port of Buenos Aires, and other faculties, however.</p>
       <p>On 1 November 2012, the voting age was lowered from 18 to 16. Voting is compulsory for Argentineans between 18 and 70, but voluntary for 16 and 17-year-olds under the new law.</p>

       <p>Argentina is a full member of the <!--del_lnk--> Mercosur block together with Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Since 2002 Argentina has emphasized the role of <!--del_lnk--> Latin American integration and the bloc, which has some supranational legislative functions, as its first international priority. Argentina is a founding signatory and permanent consulting member of the <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctic_Treaty_System.htm" title="Antarctic Treaty System">Antarctic Treaty System</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Treaty Secretariat is based in Buenos Aires. Argentina is also a full member of the <!--del_lnk--> Union of South American Nations. The former president of Argentina <!--del_lnk--> N&eacute;stor Kirchner was the first <!--del_lnk--> Secretary General of this organization. Argentina is part of the <!--del_lnk--> G-20 as well.</p>
       <p>Argentina <!--del_lnk--> claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (<a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>: <span lang="es"><i>Islas Malvinas</i></span>), and <!--del_lnk--> South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, which are administered by the United Kingdom as <!--del_lnk--> British Overseas Territories, as well as almost 1,000,000 square kilometres (390,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in <!--del_lnk--> Antarctica, between 25&deg;W and 74&deg;W and south of 60&deg;S. The Antarctic claim overlaps claims by <!--del_lnk--> Chile and the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom, though all claims to Antarctica fall under the provisions of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Antarctic_Treaty_System.htm" title="Antarctic Treaty">Antarctic Treaty</a> of 1961. Since 1904, a <!--del_lnk--> scientific post has been maintained in Antarctica by mutual agreement.</p>
       <p>Argentina and Brazil remain major trading partners in the Southamerican region. In addition, these countries work together in making satellites orbiting over South America performing different jobs.</p>
       <p>Argentina is currently participating in major peacekeeping operations in <!--del_lnk--> Haiti, <!--del_lnk--> Cyprus, <a href="../../wp/w/Western_Sahara.htm" title="Western Sahara">Western Sahara</a> and the Middle East.</p>
       <p>Within the term of President <!--del_lnk--> N&eacute;stor Kirchner, from 2003 onwards, Argentina suspended its policy of automatic alignment with the United States and moved closer to other Latin American countries. Argentina no longer supports the UN Commission on Human Rights resolution criticizing the "human rights situation in Cuba" and calling upon the Government of Cuba to "adhere to international human rights norms", but has chosen instead to abstain. In the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 United Nations Security Council election, Argentina supported, like all Mercosur countries, the candidacy of Venezuela (a Mercosur member) over Guatemala for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mercosur has become a central part of the Argentine foreign policy, with the goal of forming a Latin American trade block. Argentina has chosen to form a block with Brazil when it comes to external negotiations, though the economic asymmetries between South America's two largest countries have produced tension at times.</p>
       <p>Between 4 and 5 November 2005, the city of <!--del_lnk--> Mar del Plata hosted the <!--del_lnk--> Fourth Summit of the Americas. Although the themes were unemployment and poverty, most of the discussion was focused on the FTAA. The summit was a failure in this regard, but marked a clear split between the countries of the Mercosur, plus <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, and the supporters of the FTAA, led by the United States, Mexico and Canada. FTAA negotiations have effectively stalled until at least the conclusion of the 2006 <!--del_lnk--> Doha round global trade talks.</p>
       <p>In 2005, <!--del_lnk--> Argentina assumed again the two-year non-permanent position on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_Security_Council.htm" title="UN Security Council">UN Security Council</a>.</p>
       <p>As of 2007, during Kirchner's almost four years in power, Argentina entered into 294 bilateral agreements, including 39 with <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, 37 with <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, 30 with <a href="../../wp/b/Bolivia.htm" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, 21 with Brazil, 12 with the People's Republic of China, 10 with Germany, 9 with the United States and Italy, and 7 with <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, Paraguay, Spain and Russia.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The Armed Forces are controlled by the Commander-in-Chief (the President) and a civilian Minister of Defense. In addition to the army, navy and air force, there are two forces controlled by the Interior Ministry: the Argentine National Gendarmerie, a gendarmerie used to guard borders and places of strategic importance; and the Naval Prefecture, a coast guard used to protect internal major rivers and maritime territory.</p>
       <p>The armed forces of Argentina comprise an <!--del_lnk--> army, <!--del_lnk--> navy and <!--del_lnk--> air force, and number about 70,000 active duty personnel, one third fewer than levels before the return to democracy in 1983. The President is <!--del_lnk--> commander-in-chief of the armed forces, with the Defense Ministry exercising day-to-day control. There are also two other forces; the <!--del_lnk--> Naval Prefecture (which patrols Argentine <!--del_lnk--> territorial waters) and the <!--del_lnk--> National Gendarmerie (which patrols the border regions); both arms are controlled by the Interior Ministry but maintain liaison with the Defense Ministry. The age for enlistment in the <!--del_lnk--> volunteer military is from 16 to 23 years old.</p>
       <p>Argentina is committed to international <a href="../../wp/p/Peacekeeping.htm" title="Peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a> under United Nations mandates, humanitarian aid on emergencies relief and support the country's continuous presence at <!--del_lnk--> Antarctica.</p>
       <p>Democratic governments since 1983 straightened the military budget and did not approve any large scale equipment purchases. Argentina military spending is one of the lowest of South America  and as of 2010, its 0.9% of <a href="../../wp/g/Gross_domestic_product.htm" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a> only exceeds <a href="../../wp/s/Suriname.htm" title="Suriname">Suriname</a> </p>
       <p>Historically, Argentina's military has been one of the best equipped in the region (for example, developing its own jet fighters as early as the 1950s); but recently it has faced sharper expenditure cutbacks than most other Latin American armed forces. Real military expenditures declined steadily after 1981 and though there have been recent increases, the defense budget is now around US$3&nbsp;billion.</p>
       <p>Since 2000s, the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine defense industry was relaunched after the politics of privatization carried out during the 1990s by <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Menem administration virtually eliminated all.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Mercosur is an economic entity. However, the strengthening of confidence among the member countries has been beneficial to the peace in the region, exercising a useful role in supporting democracy. The Mercosur served, for example, to discourage the <!--del_lnk--> Paraguayan military from an attempted coup in early 2000.</p>
       <p>Traditionally, Argentina maintains close defense cooperation and military-supply relationships with the United States, and to a lesser extent, with Israel, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
       <p>On 2007 an agreement for cooperation in peace operations was signed with France.</p>
       <p>Argentina created with Chile a combined force for future United Nations mandates. Named <b>Cruz del Sur</b> (English: <!--del_lnk--> Crux), the new force began assembly in 2008 with headquarters alternately on each country every year.</p>
       <p>On 2009, <!--del_lnk--> UNASUR, the South America countries union, created the CDS ( Spanish: <i>Consejo de Defensa Sudamericano</i> (South American Defence council) in order to promote cooperation and transparency between their armed forces </p>

       <p>Argentina is composed of twenty-three provinces and one <!--del_lnk--> autonomous city, Buenos Aires. The administrative divisions of the Provinces are the <!--del_lnk--> departments, and the <!--del_lnk--> municipalities, except for <!--del_lnk--> Buenos Aires Province, which is divided into <!--del_lnk--> partidos. The City of Buenos Aires is divided into <!--del_lnk--> communes. The provinces are organized as a federation, each one with a local constitution. They hold all the power that is not specifically delegated to the national government.</p>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine War of Independence the main cities and their surrounding countrysides became provinces, though the intervention of their <!--del_lnk--> cabildos. The anarchy of the year XX completed this process, shaping the original thirteen provinces. <!--del_lnk--> Jujuy seceded from <!--del_lnk--> Salta in 1834, and the thirteen provinces became fourteen. After <!--del_lnk--> seceding for a decade, Buenos Aires accepted the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Argentina of 1853 in 1860. Buenos Aires was made a federal territory in 1880.</p>
       <p>A 1862 law determined that the territories under control of Argentina but outside the frontiers of the provinces would be called <!--del_lnk--> national territories. This allowed in 1884 to establish the <!--del_lnk--> governorates of Misiones, Formosa, Chaco, La Pampa, Neuqu&eacute;n, R&iacute;o Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego. The agreement about a frontier dispute with Chile in 1900 created the national territory of Los Andes, whose territories were incorporated into Jujuy, Salta and <!--del_lnk--> Catamarca in 1943. <!--del_lnk--> La Pampa and <!--del_lnk--> Chaco became provinces in 1951. <!--del_lnk--> Misiones did so in 1953, and <!--del_lnk--> Formosa, <!--del_lnk--> Neuqu&eacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o Negro, <!--del_lnk--> Chubut and <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz in 1955. The last national territory, <!--del_lnk--> Tierra del Fuego, became a province in 1990.</p>

       <p>The economy of Argentina is Latin America's third-largest, with a <!--del_lnk--> Very High Human Development Index and a relatively <!--del_lnk--> high GDP per capita. It is classified as an upper middle-income economy by the Wold Bank.</p>
       <p>The country benefits from rich <!--del_lnk--> natural resources, a highly literate population, an export-oriented <!--del_lnk--> agricultural sector and a diversified <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industrial base</a>. Historically, however, Argentina's economic performance has been very uneven, in which high economic growth alternated with severe recessions, particularly during the late twentieth century, and income maldistribution and poverty increased. Early in the twentieth century it was one of the richest countries in the world and the richest in the <!--del_lnk--> Southern hemisphere, though it is now an upper-middle income country.</p>
       <p>Argentina is considered an <!--del_lnk--> emerging market by the <!--del_lnk--> FTSE Global Equity Index, and is one of the <!--del_lnk--> G-20 major economies.</p>
       <p>High inflation has been a weakness of the Argentine economy for decades. Officially hovering around 9% since 2006, inflation has been privately estimated at over 30%, becoming a contentious issue again. The government has manipulated inflation statistics. The urban income <a href="../../wp/p/Poverty_threshold.htm" title="Poverty threshold">poverty rate</a> has dropped below the numbers of the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 economic crisis <!--del_lnk--> Income distribution, having improved since 2002, is still considerably unequal. Argentina began a period of <!--del_lnk--> fiscal austerity in 2012.</p>
       <p>Argentina ranks 100th out of 178 countries in the <!--del_lnk--> Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2011. Reported problems include government corruption, lack of judicial independence, huge taxes and tariffs, and regulatory interference that undermines efficiency and productivity growth. The Kirchner administration responded to the <!--del_lnk--> Global financial crisis of 2008&ndash;2009 with a record public-works program, new tax cuts and subsidies, and the transfer of private pensions to the social security system. Private pension plans, which required growing subsidies to cover, were nationalized to shed a budgetary drain as well as to finance high government spending and debt obligations.</p>

       <p><a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">Manufacturing</a> is the largest single sector in the nation's economy (19% of GDP), and is well-integrated into Argentine agriculture, with half the nation's industrial exports being agricultural in nature. Based on food processing and textiles during its early development in the first half of the 20th century, industrial production has become highly diversified in Argentina. Leading sectors by production value are: <!--del_lnk--> Food processing and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Drink.htm" title="Beverage">beverages</a>; <!--del_lnk--> motor vehicles and <!--del_lnk--> auto parts; <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/o/Oil_refinery.htm" title="Petroleum refineries">refinery products</a>, and <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiesel.htm" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a>; <!--del_lnk--> chemicals and <!--del_lnk--> pharmaceuticals; <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Aluminium.htm" title="Aluminum">aluminium</a>; and <!--del_lnk--> industrial and <!--del_lnk--> farm machinery; <a href="../../wp/e/Electronics.htm" title="Electronics">electronics</a> and <!--del_lnk--> home appliances. These latter include over three million big ticket items, as well as an array of electronics, kitchen appliances and cellular phones, among others. The country's auto industry produced 829,000 motor vehicles in 2011, and exported 507,000 (mainly to Brazil, which in turn exported a somewhat larger number to Argentina). Beverages are another significant sector, and Argentina has long been among the top five wine producing countries in the world; beer overtook wine production in 2000, and today leads by nearly two billion liters a year to one.</p>
       <p>Other manufactured goods include: <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a> and <!--del_lnk--> cement; <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Plastic.htm" title="Plastics">plastics</a> and <!--del_lnk--> tires; <!--del_lnk--> lumber products; <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textiles</a>; <!--del_lnk--> tobacco products; <!--del_lnk--> recording and <!--del_lnk--> print media; <!--del_lnk--> furniture; <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Clothing.htm" title="Apparel">apparel</a> and <!--del_lnk--> leather. Most manufacturing is organized around 280 <!--del_lnk--> industrial parks, with another 190 slated to open during 2012. Nearly half the industries are based in the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Buenos Aires area, although <!--del_lnk--> C&oacute;rdoba, <!--del_lnk--> Rosario, and <!--del_lnk--> Ushuaia are also significant industrial centers; the latter city became the nation's leading centre of <a href="../../wp/e/Electronics.htm" title="Electronics">electronics</a> production during the 1980s. The production of <a href="../../wp/c/Computer.htm" title="Computer">computers</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Laptop.htm" title="Laptop">laptops</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> servers grew by 160% in 2011, to nearly 3.4 million units, and covered two-thirds of local demand. Another important rubric historically dominated by imports &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> farm machinery &ndash; will likewise mainly be manufactured domestically by 2014.</p>
       <p>Construction permits nationwide covered nearly 19 million m&sup2; (205&nbsp;million ft&sup2;) in 2008. The construction sector accounts for over 5% of GDP, and two-thirds of the construction was for residential buildings.</p>
       <p>Argentine electric output totaled over 122&nbsp;billion <!--del_lnk--> Kwh in 2009. This was generated in large part through well developed natural gas and <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectric resources. <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_power.htm" title="Nuclear power">Nuclear energy</a> is also of high importance, and the country is one of the largest producers and exporters, alongside Canada and Russia of <!--del_lnk--> cobalt-60, a <!--del_lnk--> radioactive <a href="../../wp/i/Isotope.htm" title="Isotope">isotope</a> widely used in cancer therapy.</p>

       <p>Argentina has three Nobel Prize laureates in sciences. Argentine research has led to the treatment of <!--del_lnk--> heart diseases and several forms of cancer. <!--del_lnk--> Domingo Liotta designed and developed the first <!--del_lnk--> artificial heart successfully implanted in a human being in 1969. <!--del_lnk--> Ren&eacute; Favaloro developed the techniques and performed the world's first ever coronary <!--del_lnk--> bypass surgery.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Bernardo Houssay, the first Latin American awarded with a Nobel Prize in the Sciences, discovered the role of <!--del_lnk--> pituitary hormones in regulating <a href="../../wp/g/Glucose.htm" title="Glucose">glucose</a> in animals; <!--del_lnk--> C&eacute;sar Milstein did extensive research in <a href="../../wp/a/Antibody.htm" title="Antibody">antibodies</a>; <!--del_lnk--> Luis Leloir discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into <!--del_lnk--> glycogen and the compounds which are fundamental in <!--del_lnk--> metabolizing <a href="../../wp/c/Carbohydrate.htm" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrates</a>. A team led by <!--del_lnk--> Alberto Taquini and <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Braun-Men&eacute;ndez discovered <!--del_lnk--> angiotensin in 1939, and was the first to describe the enzymatic nature of the <!--del_lnk--> renin-angiotensin system and its role in <a href="../../wp/h/Hypertension.htm" title="Hypertension">hypertension</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Leloir Institute of <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a> is among the most prestigious in its field in Latin America.</p>
       <p>Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Luis Agote devised the first safe method of <!--del_lnk--> blood transfusion, <!--del_lnk--> Enrique Finochietto designed operating table tools such as the surgical scissors that bear his name ("Finochietto scissors") and a surgical rib-spreader.</p>

       <p>Argentina's <!--del_lnk--> nuclear program is highly advanced, having resulted in a <!--del_lnk--> research reactor in 1957 and Latin America's first on-line commercial reactor in 1974. Argentina developed its nuclear program without being overly dependent on foreign technology. Nuclear facilities with Argentine technology have been built in Peru, <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>, Australia and <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. In 1983, the country admitted having the capability of producing weapon-grade <a href="../../wp/u/Uranium.htm" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, a major step needed to assemble <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>; since then, however, Argentina has pledged to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes. As a member of the Board of Governors of the <!--del_lnk--> International Atomic Energy Agency, Argentina has been a strong voice in support of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and is highly committed to global nuclear security.</p>
       <p>In other areas, <!--del_lnk--> Juan Vucetich, a Croatian immigrant, was the father of modern <!--del_lnk--> fingerprinting (dactiloscopy). <!--del_lnk--> Juan Maldacena, an Argentine-American scientist, is a leading figure in <a href="../../wp/s/String_theory.htm" title="String theory">string theory</a>. Argentine built satellites include LUSAT-1 (1990), V&iacute;ctor-1 (1996), PEHUENSAT-1 (2007), and those developed by <!--del_lnk--> CONAE, the Argentine space agency, of the SAC series. The <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Auger Observatory near <!--del_lnk--> Malarg&uuml;e, Mendoza, is the world's foremost <!--del_lnk--> cosmic ray observatory.</p>
       <p>Despite its modest budget and numerous setbacks, academics and the sciences in Argentina have enjoyed an international respect since the turn of the 1900s, when Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Luis Agote devised the first safe and effective means of <!--del_lnk--> blood transfusion as well as <!--del_lnk--> Ren&eacute; Favaloro, who was a pioneer in the improvement of the <!--del_lnk--> coronary artery bypass surgery. Argentina has three Nobel Prize winners in the sciences: <!--del_lnk--> Bernardo Houssay in Physiology or Medicine in 1947, <!--del_lnk--> Luis Federico Leloir in Chemistry in 1970, and <!--del_lnk--> C&eacute;sar Milstein in Physiology or Medicine in 1984. Argentine scientists are still on the cutting edge in fields such as <!--del_lnk--> nanotechnology, <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Computer_science.htm" title="Computer science">computer sciences</a>, molecular biology, oncology, ecology, and <!--del_lnk--> cardiology, where Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Domingo Liotta created the first artificial heart in 1969, revolutionizing the heart transplant field.</p>
       <p>They have also contributed to <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">bioscience</a> in efforts like the <!--del_lnk--> Human Genome Project, where Argentine scientists have successfully mapped the <!--del_lnk--> genome of a living being, a world first. Argentina has its own satellite programme, nuclear power station designs (4th generation) and public nuclear energy company <!--del_lnk--> INVAP, which provides several countries with nuclear reactors.</p>
       <p>Other projects are focusing on IT, nanotechnology, biotechnology, helicopters, farming machinery and military defensive systems. Space research has also become increasingly active in Argentina. Established in 1991, the <!--del_lnk--> CONAE has since launched two satellites successfully and, in June 2009, secured an agreement with the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Space_Agency.htm" title="European Space Agency">European Space Agency</a> on for the installation of a 35-m diameter antenna and other mission support facilities at the <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Auger Observatory. The facility will contribute to numerous ESA space probes, as well as CONAE's own, domestic research projects. Chosen from 20 potential sites and one of only three such ESA installations in the world, the new antenna will create a triangulation which will allow the ESA to ensure mission coverage around the clock.</p>
       <p>Four out of five Argentine adults have completed grade school, over a third have completed their secondary education and one in nine Argentine adults have college degrees. Likewise, Argentina has the highest rate of university students in Latin America, besides having more within the southern hemisphere with professors and institutions awarded prestigious prizes and fellowships from philanthropic institutions like the John S. Guggenheim Foundation awards or the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, to name a few. Official sources recently reported roughly 1,500,000 college students within the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine University System; this represents the highest rate &ndash; relative to its total population &ndash; of academic students in Latin America and exceeds the ratio in many developed countries.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tourism">Tourism</span></h3>
       <p>As of 2011, Argentina is the most visited country in South America and the fourth most visited in the Americas. According to official figures from the World Tourism Organization, in 2010 the country received more than 5,300,000 foreign tourists, which meant about 4,930 million dollars of income from divisas. The <!--del_lnk--> World Economic Forum estimated that, in 2006 tourism generated around US$25 billion in economic turnover, and employed 1.8 million. Domestic tourism amounted to over 80% of this and tourism from abroad contributed US$ 4.3 billion, becoming the third largest source of foreign exchange in 2004. Around 4.6 million foreign visitors arrived in 2007, yielding a positive balance vis-&agrave;-vis the number of Argentines traveling abroad. <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> is in the midst of a tourism boom, according to the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council, it reveals strong growth for Argentina Travel and Tourism in 2007 and in coming years, and the prestigious travel and tourism publication; <!--del_lnk--> Travel + Leisure Magazine, a monthly publication leader in the world-wide market of travel magazines, travelers voted Buenos Aires the second most desirable city to visit after <!--del_lnk--> Florence, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>. Buenos Aires, regarded as the "Paris of South America," offers elegant architecture, exquisite cuisine, a legendary nightlife, and fashionable shopping. The most popular tourist sites are found in the historic city core, comprising <!--del_lnk--> Montserrat and <!--del_lnk--> San Telmo. The city was originally constructed around the <!--del_lnk--> Plaza de Mayo, the administrative centre of the Spanish Colony. To the east of the square is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Casa Rosada</i>, the official seat of the <!--del_lnk--> executive branch of the government of Argentina. To the north, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Catedral Metropolitana</i> which has stood in the same location since colonial times, and the <!--del_lnk--> Banco de la Naci&oacute;n Argentina building, a parcel of land originally owned by <!--del_lnk--> Juan de Garay. Other important colonial institutions were <!--del_lnk--> Cabildo, to the west, which was renovated during the construction of <!--del_lnk--> Avenida de Mayo and Julio A. Roca. To the south is the <i>Congreso de la Naci&oacute;n</i> (National Congress), which currently houses the <i>Academia Nacional de la Historia</i> (National Academy of History). Lastly, to the northwest, is City Hall.</p>
       <p>The borough of <!--del_lnk--> Recoleta is home to a number of places of interest, including the <i><!--del_lnk--> Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes</i>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Biblioteca Nacional</i>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Centro Cultural Recoleta</i>, the Faculty of Law of the <!--del_lnk--> Universidad de Buenos Aires, the <i>Bas&iacute;lica Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Pilar</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> Palais de Glace, the <!--del_lnk--> Caf&eacute; La Biela and the <!--del_lnk--> Cementerio de la Recoleta, where <!--del_lnk--> Eva Per&oacute;n's crypt can be visited, among those of many other Argentine historical and cultural figures.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The education in Argentina known as the <i>Latin American docta</i> has had a convoluted history. There was no effective education plan until <!--del_lnk--> President <!--del_lnk--> Domingo Sarmiento (1868&ndash;1874) placed emphasis on bringing Argentina up-to-date with practices in developed countries. Sarmiento encouraged the immigration and settling of European educators and built schools and public <a href="../../wp/l/Library.htm" title="Library">libraries</a> throughout the country, in a programme that finally doubled the enrollment of students during his term; in Argentina, <!--del_lnk--> Teacher's Day (on September 11) commemorates his death. The first national laws mandating universal, compulsory, free and secular education (<!--del_lnk--> Law 1420 of Common Education) were sanctioned in 1884 during the administration of President <!--del_lnk--> Julio Roca. The non-religious character of this system, which forbade parochial schools from issuing official degrees directly but only through a public university, harmed the <!--del_lnk--> relations between the Argentine State and the Catholic Church, leading to resistance from the local clergy and a heated conflict with the <!--del_lnk--> Holy See (through the Papal <!--del_lnk--> Nuncio).</p>
       <p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> university reform of 1918, Argentine education, especially at university level, became more independent of the government, as well as the influential Catholic Church. The church began to re-emerge in country's secular education system during the administration <!--del_lnk--> Juan Per&oacute;n, when in 1947, <!--del_lnk--> catechism was reintroduced in public schools, and parochial institutions began again receiving subsidies. A sudden reversal in the policy in 1954 helped lead to Per&oacute;n's violent overthrow, after which his earlier, pro-clerical policies were reinstated by General <!--del_lnk--> Pedro Aramburu. Aramburu's Law 6403 of 1955, which advanced private education generally, and parochial, or more often, Catholic-run schools (those staffed with lay techers), in particular, helped lead to the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Catholic University.</p>

       <p>The program of deregulation and privatization pursued by President <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Menem in reaction to the country's socio-economic crisis of 1989 led to the decentralization of the Argentine secondary school system, whereby, from 1992 onwards, the schools' administration and funding became a provincial responsibility. The policy's weakness, however, lay in that federal <!--del_lnk--> revenue sharing did not increase accordingly, particularly given the decision to shift two primary school years to the secondary system.</p>
       <p>Real government spending on education increased steadily from the return of democratic rule in <!--del_lnk--> 1983 (with the exception of the crises in 1989 and 2002) and, in 2007, totaled over US$14 billion. Argentina built a national public education system in comparison to other nations, placing the country high in the global rankings of <a href="../../wp/l/Literacy.htm" title="Literacy">literacy</a>. Today Argentina has a <!--del_lnk--> literacy rate of 97,4%, and 16.2% over age 15 have completed secondary school studies or higher.</p>
       <p>School attendance is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 17. The Argentine school system consists of an elementary or lower school level lasting six or seven years, and a secondary or high school level lasting between five to six years. In the 1990s, the system was split into different types of high school instruction, called <i>Educacion Secundaria</i> and the <i>Polimodal</i>. Some provinces adopted the <i>Polimodal</i> while others did not. A project in the executive branch to repeal this measure and return to a more traditional secondary level system was approved in 2006.</p>
       <p>There are forty-seven <!--del_lnk--> national public universities across the country, as well as forty-six private ones. The <!--del_lnk--> University of Buenos Aires, <!--del_lnk--> Universidad Nacional de C&oacute;rdoba, <!--del_lnk--> Universidad Nacional de La Plata, <!--del_lnk--> Universidad Nacional de Rosario, and the <!--del_lnk--> National Technological University are among the most important. Public universities faced cutbacks in spending during the 1980s and 1990s, which led to a decline in overall quality.</p>

       <p><a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">Transport</a> in Argentina is mainly based on a complex network of routes, crossed by relatively inexpensive long-distance buses and by cargo trucks. The country also has a number of national and international <!--del_lnk--> airports. The importance of the long-distance train is minor today, though in the past it was widely used. <!--del_lnk--> Fluvial transport is mostly used for cargo. Within the urban areas, the main transportation system is uy the bus or colectivo; bus lines transport millions of people every day in the larger cities and their metropolitan areas. Buenos Aires additionally has an underground, the only one in the country, and Greater Buenos Aires is serviced by a system of <!--del_lnk--> suburban <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Trains">trains</a>.</p>
       <p>A majority of people employ <!--del_lnk--> public transport rather than personal cars to move around in the cities, especially in common business hours, since parking can be both difficult and expensive. Cycling is not very common in big cities, as there are few bicycle-paths, making it difficult to move with them other than in recreational areas.</p>
       <p>Since Argentina is almost 4,000 kilometres long and more than 1,000&nbsp;km wide, long distance transportation is of great importance. Several toll expressways spread out from <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, serving nearly half the nation's population. The majority of Argentine roads, however, are two-lane national and provincial routes and, though they are spread throughout the country, less than a third of Argentina's 230,000&nbsp;km (145,000&nbsp;mi) of roads are currently paved.</p>
       <p>Though, by 1929, Argentina was already home to over 400,000 vehicles (more than half the total in Latin America, at the time), virtually all long-distance travel was done on the nation's vast railways. Argentina, then, lacked a road-building program until 1932, when the National Highway Directorate was established. Paid for at first with an excise tax on gasoline, the bureau could claim some important accomplishments, like the 1951 opening of the 200&nbsp;km <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe-<!--del_lnk--> Rosario expressway, Latin America's first.</p>

       <p>Argentina is home to around 9.2 million registered cars, trucks and buses; on a per capita basis, it has long had Latin America's widest accessibility to motor vehicles. Left-lane drivers until 1945, Argentine motorists have since been driving on the right-hand side. The <!--del_lnk--> Vehicle registration plates of Argentina are based on a three letters-three numbers per car (with the exception of some trucks) system.</p>
       <p>Expressways have been recently doubled in length (to nearly) and now link most (though not all) important cities. The most important of these is probably the <!--del_lnk--> Panamerican <!--del_lnk--> National Route 9 Buenos Aires&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> Rosario&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> C&oacute;rdoba freeway. The longest continuous highways are <!--del_lnk--> National Route 40, a 5000-km stretch along the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> range and the 3000-km sea-side trunk road <!--del_lnk--> National Route 3, running from <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Ushuaia.</p>
       <p>Argentine long distance buses are fast, affordable and comfortable; they have become the primary means of long-distance travel since railway privatizations in the early 1990s greatly downsized Argentina's formerly ubiquitous passenger rail service. Competing providers differ little on their time-honoured formula, offering three different services regarding the number of stops and type of seats: the <i>Regular</i>, <i>Semi-cama</i> (semi-bed), and <i>Cama</i> (bed), with <i>Cama</i> being similar to an airline's <!--del_lnk--> business class. Some services have also on-board dining, while others stop at restaurants by the road. Long and middle-distance buses cover almost all paved-accessible cities, towns and villages.</p>

       <p>Health care is provided through a combination of employer and labor union-sponsored plans (<i>Obras Sociales</i>), government insurance plans, public hospitals and clinics and through private health insurance plans. Health care cooperatives number over 300 (of which 200 are related to <a href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade union">labor unions</a>) and provide health care for half the population; the national INSSJP (popularly known as PAMI) covers nearly all of the five million senior citizens.</p>
       <p>There are more than 153,000 hospital beds, 121,000 physicians and 37,000 dentists (ratios comparable to <!--del_lnk--> developed nations). The relatively high access to medical care has historically resulted in mortality patterns and trends similar to developed nations': from 1953 to 2005, deaths from <!--del_lnk--> cardiovascular disease increased from 20% to 23% of the total, those from <!--del_lnk--> tumors from 14% to 20%, <!--del_lnk--> respiratory problems from 7% to 14%, <!--del_lnk--> digestive maladies (non-infectious) from 7% to 11%, strokes a steady 7%, injuries, 6%, and <a href="../../wp/i/Infection.htm" title="Infection">infectious</a> diseases, 4%. Causes related to <!--del_lnk--> senility led to many of the rest. Infant deaths have fallen from 19% of all deaths in 1953 to 3% in 2005.</p>
       <p>The availability of health care has also reduced <!--del_lnk--> infant mortality from 70 per 1000 live births in 1948 to 12.1 in 2009 and raised <!--del_lnk--> life expectancy at birth from 60 years to 76. Though these figures compare favorably with global averages, they fall short of levels in developed nations and in 2006, Argentina ranked fourth in Latin America.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Culture">Culture</span></h2>
       <p>Argentine culture has significant European influences. Buenos Aires, its cultural capital, is largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of European styles in <!--del_lnk--> architecture. The other big influence is the gauchos and their traditional country lifestyle of self-reliance. Finally, indigenous American traditions (like <!--del_lnk--> yerba mate infusions) have been absorbed into the general cultural milieu.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Argentine wine industry, long among the largest outside Europe, has benefited from growing investment since 1992; in 2007, 60% of foreign investment worldwide in <!--del_lnk--> viticulture was destined to Argentina.

       <p>Argentina has a rich literary history, as well as one of the region's most active publishing industries. Argentine writers have figured prominently in Latin American literature since becoming a fully united entity in the 1850s. The struggle between the Federalists and the Unitarians, set the tone for Argentine literature of the time.</p>
       <p>The ideological divide between gaucho epic <!--del_lnk--> Mart&iacute;n Fierro by <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Hern&aacute;ndez, and <!--del_lnk--> Facundo by <!--del_lnk--> Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, is a great example. Hern&aacute;ndez, a federalist, was opposed to the centralizing, modernizing and Europeanizing tendencies. Sarmiento wrote in support of immigration as the only way to save Argentina from becoming subject to the rule of a small number of dictatorial <!--del_lnk--> caudillo families, arguing such immigrants would make Argentina more modern and open to Western European influences and therefore a more prosperous society.</p>
       <p>Argentine literature of that period was fiercely nationalist. It was followed by the <!--del_lnk--> modernist movement, which emerged in France in the late 19th century, and this period in turn was followed by <!--del_lnk--> vanguardism, with <!--del_lnk--> Ricardo G&uuml;iraldes as an important reference. <a href="../../wp/j/Jorge_Luis_Borges.htm" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, its most acclaimed writer, found new ways of looking at the modern world in metaphor and philosophical debate and his influence has extended to writers all over the globe. Borges is most famous for his works in short stories such as <!--del_lnk--> Ficciones and <!--del_lnk--> The Aleph.</p>
       <p>The Argentine literature is the body of literary work produced in Argentina. Some of the nation's notable writers, poets and intellectuals include: <!--del_lnk--> Juan Bautista Alberdi, <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Arlt, <!--del_lnk--> Enrique Banchs, <!--del_lnk--> Adolfo Bioy Casares, <a href="../../wp/j/Jorge_Luis_Borges.htm" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Silvina Bullrich, <!--del_lnk--> Eugenio Cambaceres, <!--del_lnk--> Julio Cort&aacute;zar, <!--del_lnk--> Esteban Echeverr&iacute;a, <!--del_lnk--> Leopoldo Lugones, <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Mallea, <!--del_lnk--> Ezequiel Mart&iacute;nez Estrada, <!--del_lnk--> Tom&aacute;s Eloy Mart&iacute;nez, <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Ocampo, <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Puig, <!--del_lnk--> Ernesto Sabato, <!--del_lnk--> Osvaldo Soriano, <!--del_lnk--> Alfonsina Storni and <!--del_lnk--> Mar&iacute;a Elena Walsh.</p>
       <p>As a matter of fact, the name of the country itself comes from a Latinism which first appeared in a literary source: <!--del_lnk--> Martin del Barco Centenera's epic poem <i>La Argentina</i> (1602). This composition runs 10.000 verses and describes the landscape as well as the conquest of the territory. The word was reintroduced in <i>Argentina manuscrita</i>, a prose chronicle by Ruy D&iacute;az de Guzm&aacute;n.</p>
       <p>Argentine literature began around 1550 with the work of Mat&iacute;as Rojas de Oquendo and Pedro Gonz&aacute;lez de Prado (from <!--del_lnk--> Santiago del Estero, the first important urban settlement in Argentina), who wrote <!--del_lnk--> prose and <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a>. They were partly inspired by oral <!--del_lnk--> aboriginal poetry&mdash;in particular, according to Carlos Abreg&uacute; Virreyra, by the <i>lules</i>, <i>jur&iacute;es</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> diaguitas</i> and <i>tonocot&eacute;s</i>. A <!--del_lnk--> symbiosis emerged between the aboriginal and Spanish traditions, creating a distinct literature, geographically limited (well into the 18th century) to the Argentine north and central regions, with the province of <!--del_lnk--> C&oacute;rdoba as its centre, due to the foundation of the <!--del_lnk--> National University of C&oacute;rdoba. Two names stand out from this period: Gaspar Ju&aacute;rez Baviano, and Antonia de la Paz y Figueroa, also known as "Beata Antula".</p>
       <p>Gradually, with the economic prosperity of the port, the cultural axis moved eastward. The letters of the colonial age (Viceroyalty-<a href="../../wp/n/Neoclassicism.htm" title="Neoclassicism">neoclassicism</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">baroque</a> and <!--del_lnk--> epic) grew under the protection of the <!--del_lnk--> independentist fervor: <!--del_lnk--> Vicente L&oacute;pez y Planes, Pantale&oacute;n Rivarola and <!--del_lnk--> Esteban de Luca.</p>
       <p>During the 17th century, Argentine baroque was poor in comparison with that from Europe and some other parts of the New World. The only remarkable poet of this period was fray Jos&eacute; Luis de Tejeda who wrote <i>Coronas l&iacute;ricas</i> and <i>El peregrino de Babilonia</i>.</p>

       <p>One of the most influential Argentine figures in fine arts was <!--del_lnk--> Xul Solar, whose <!--del_lnk--> surrealist work used <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Watercolor_painting.htm" title="Watercolor">watercolors</a> as readily as unorthodox painting media; he also "invented" two imaginary languages. The works of <!--del_lnk--> C&aacute;ndido L&oacute;pez and <!--del_lnk--> Florencio Molina Campos (in <!--del_lnk--> Na&iuml;ve art style), <!--del_lnk--> Ernesto de la C&aacute;rcova and <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo S&iacute;vori (<!--del_lnk--> realism), <!--del_lnk--> Fernando Fader (<a href="../../wp/i/Impressionism.htm" title="Impressionism">impressionism</a>), <!--del_lnk--> P&iacute;o Collivadino and <!--del_lnk--> Ces&aacute;reo Bernaldo de Quir&oacute;s (<!--del_lnk--> post-impressionist), <!--del_lnk--> Emilio Pettoruti (<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubist">cubist</a>), <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Berni (<!--del_lnk--> neo-figurative), <!--del_lnk--> Gyula Ko&scaron;ice (<a href="../../wp/c/Constructivism_%2528art%2529.htm" title="Constructivism (art)">constructivism</a>), <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Mac Entyre (<!--del_lnk--> Generative art), <!--del_lnk--> Guillermo Kuitca (<a href="../../wp/a/Abstract_art.htm" title="Abstract art">abstract</a>), and <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Aizenberg (<!--del_lnk--> Surrealism) are a few of the best-known Argentine painters.</p>
       <p>Others include <!--del_lnk--> Benito Quinquela Mart&iacute;n, a quintessential 'port' painter for whom the working class and immigrant-bound <!--del_lnk--> La Boca neighbourhood, in particular, was excellently suited. A similar environment inspired <!--del_lnk--> Adolfo Bellocq, whose <!--del_lnk--> lithographs have been influential since the 1920s. Evocative monuments ny Realist sculptors <!--del_lnk--> Erminio Blotta, <!--del_lnk--> Lola Mora and <!--del_lnk--> Rogelio Yrurtia became the part of the national landscape and today, <!--del_lnk--> Lucio Fontana and <!--del_lnk--> Le&oacute;n Ferrari are acclaimed <a href="../../wp/s/Sculpture.htm" title="Sculpture">sculptors</a> and <!--del_lnk--> conceptual artists. <!--del_lnk--> Ciruelo is a world-famous fantasy artist and sculptor, and <!--del_lnk--> Marta Minuj&iacute;n is an innovative <!--del_lnk--> Conceptual artist. Argentina's "modern painters" are a difficult group to define. They have developed a constructivist rather than figurative style, though it is not quite abstract. Artists of this group include <!--del_lnk--> Julio Barrag&aacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> Luis Seoane, Carlos Torrallardona, <!--del_lnk--> Luis Aquino, Atilio Malinverno, and Alfredo Gramajo Guti&eacute;rrez.</p>
       <p>Juan Del Prete (later the creator of Futucubismo, a mixture of Cubism and Futurism) came from the abstract art movement in Argentina, which developed in the 1940s from, of course, concrete art. Tom&aacute;s Maldonado is one of the most well known abstract artists.</p>
       <p>The Mad&iacute; Movement, began in Argentina in 1946. One source claims Mad&iacute; was founded in protest to the government control of the arts under Juan Per&oacute;n. while a different source says that Mad&iacute; is not necessarily a response to that oppression. The movement spread to Europe and later the United States. It is considered the only artistic movement founded in Buenos Aires to have a significant impact internationally. It was founded by <!--del_lnk--> Gyula Kosice and Carmelo Arden Quin, and included artists such as Rhod Rothfuss, Mart&iacute;n Blaszko, Waldo Longo, and Diyi Laa&ntilde;.</p>

       <p>Numerous Argentine architects have enriched their own country's cityscapes and, in recent decades, those around the world. <!--del_lnk--> Juan Antonio Buschiazzo helped popularize <!--del_lnk--> Beaux-Arts architecture and <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Gianotti combined <a href="../../wp/a/Art_Nouveau.htm" title="Art Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> with <!--del_lnk--> Italianate styles, each adding flair to Argentine cities during the early 20th century. <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Salamone and <!--del_lnk--> Viktor Sul&#x109;i&#x109; left an <!--del_lnk--> Art Deco legacy, and <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro Bustillo created a prolific body of <!--del_lnk--> Rationalist architecture. <!--del_lnk--> Clorindo Testa introduced <!--del_lnk--> Brutalist architecture locally and <!--del_lnk--> C&eacute;sar Pelli's and <!--del_lnk--> Patricio Pouchulu's <!--del_lnk--> Futurist creations have graced cities, worldwide. Pelli's 1980s throwbacks to the Art Deco glory of the 1920s, in particular, made him one of the world's most prestigious architects.</p>
       <p>The simplicity of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Rioplatense</i> <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque style">baroque style</a> can be clearly appreciated in Buenos Aires, in the works of Italian architects such as Andr&eacute; Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of <!--del_lnk--> San Ignacio, <!--del_lnk--> Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar, the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral and the <!--del_lnk--> Cabildo.</p>
       <p>Italian and French influences increased after the <!--del_lnk--> wars for independence at the beginning of the 19th century, though the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century. Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, when the European tendencies penetrated into the country, reflected in numerous important buildings of Buenos Aires, such as the Santa Felicitam Church by Ernesto Bunge; the <!--del_lnk--> Central Post Office and <!--del_lnk--> Palace of Justice, by Norbert Maillart; and the <!--del_lnk--> National Congress and the <!--del_lnk--> Col&oacute;n Opera House, by <!--del_lnk--> Vittorio Meano.</p>
       <p>The architecture of the second half of the 20th century continued adapting French <!--del_lnk--> neoclassical architecture, such as the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> National Bank of Argentina and the <!--del_lnk--> NH Gran Hotel Provincial, built by <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro Bustillo, and the <!--del_lnk--> Museo de Arte Hispano Fern&aacute;ndez Blanco, by Mart&iacute;n Noel.</p>
       <p>However, after the early 1930s, the influence of <!--del_lnk--> Rationalist architecture and of <!--del_lnk--> Le Corbusier became dominant among local architects, among whom <!--del_lnk--> Alberto Prebisch and <!--del_lnk--> Amancio Williams stand out in this new vein. The construction of <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers proliferated in Buenos Aires after 1950, though a new generation started rejecting their "brutality," and tried to find an architectonic identity.</p>
       <p>This search for identity is reflected in the <!--del_lnk--> Banco de Londres building finished in 1967 by <!--del_lnk--> Clorindo Testa with Diego Peralta Ramos, Alfredo Agostini, and Santiago S&aacute;nchez El&iacute;a. In the following decades, the new generations of architects incorporate, as always, European vanguardist styles, and new techniques.</p>
       <p>Since the latter part of the 20th century, Argentine architects have become more prominent in the design of prime real estate projects in the country, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Le Parc tower and <!--del_lnk--> Torre Aqualina, by <!--del_lnk--> Mario Roberto &Aacute;lvarez, and the Torre Fortabat by S&aacute;nchez El&iacute;a, as well as around the world, most notably the <!--del_lnk--> Norwest Centre and the <a href="../../wp/p/Petronas_Towers.htm" title="Petronas Towers">Petronas Towers</a>, both by <!--del_lnk--> C&eacute;sar Pelli.</p>

       <p>Tango, the music and lyrics (often sung in a slang called <!--del_lnk--> lunfardo), is Argentina's musical symbol. It has influences from the European and African culture. The golden age of tango (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a> and <!--del_lnk--> swing in the United States, featuring large orchestral groups too, like the bands of <!--del_lnk--> Osvaldo Pugliese, <!--del_lnk--> An&iacute;bal Troilo, <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Canaro, <!--del_lnk--> Julio de Caro and <!--del_lnk--> Juan d'Arienzo. Incorporating <!--del_lnk--> acoustic music and later, synthesizers into the genre after 1955, <!--del_lnk--> bandone&oacute;n virtuoso <!--del_lnk--> &Aacute;stor Piazzolla popularized <!--del_lnk--> "new tango" creating a more subtle, intellectual and listener-oriented trend. Today tango enjoys worldwide popularity; ever-evolving, <!--del_lnk--> neo-tango is a global phenomenon with renown groups like <!--del_lnk--> Tanghetto, <!--del_lnk--> Bajofondo and the <!--del_lnk--> Gotan Project.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Argentine rock developed as a distinct musical style in the mid-1960s, when Buenos Aires and Rosario became cradles of several garage groups and aspiring musicians. Today it is widely considered the most prolific and successful form of <!--del_lnk--> Rock en Espa&ntilde;ol. Bands such as <!--del_lnk--> Soda Stereo or <!--del_lnk--> Sumo, and composers like <!--del_lnk--> Charly Garc&iacute;a, <!--del_lnk--> Luis Alberto Spinetta, and <!--del_lnk--> Fito P&aacute;ez are referents of national culture. <!--del_lnk--> Ser&uacute; Gir&aacute;n bridged the gap into the 1980s, when Argentine bands became popular across Latin America and elsewhere. Current popular bands include: <!--del_lnk--> Babas&oacute;nicos, <!--del_lnk--> Rata Blanca, <!--del_lnk--> Horcas, <!--del_lnk--> Attaque 77, <!--del_lnk--> Bersuit, <!--del_lnk--> Los Piojos, <!--del_lnk--> Intoxicados, <!--del_lnk--> Catupecu Machu, <!--del_lnk--> Carajo and <!--del_lnk--> Miranda!.</p>
       <p>Beyond dozens of regional dances, a national Argentine folk style emerged in the 1930s. <!--del_lnk--> Per&oacute;n's Argentina would give rise to <!--del_lnk--> nueva canci&oacute;n, as artists began expressing in their music objections to political themes. The style went on to influence the entirety of <!--del_lnk--> Latin American music. Today, <!--del_lnk--> Chango Spasiuk and <!--del_lnk--> Soledad Pastorutti have brought folk back to younger generations. <!--del_lnk--> Le&oacute;n Gieco's folk-rock bridged the gap between Argentine folklore and Argentine rock, introducing both styles to millions overseas in successive tours.</p>
       <p>Following the emergence of "new tango" in the 1960s, one of Piazzolla's fellow <!--del_lnk--> bandone&oacute;nists he influenced most became a noted jazz composer in his own right. <!--del_lnk--> Rodolfo Mederos' 1976 album <i>Fuera de broma 8</i> fused <!--del_lnk--> be-bop with <!--del_lnk--> tango and <!--del_lnk--> acoustic rock; Mederos has since recorded numerous albums and film scores. His success with <!--del_lnk--> jazz fusion inspired others, like fellow bandone&oacute;nist <!--del_lnk--> Dino Saluzzi, guitarist Lito Epumer and <!--del_lnk--> alto sax man Bernardo Baraj. Later in the 1970s and through the 1990s, <!--del_lnk--> drummer <!--del_lnk--> Pocho Lapouble became well known for his jazz trio and film scores. Argentine jazz <a href="../../wp/s/Saxophone.htm" title="Saxophone">saxophonists</a> have also become prominent in their genre. <!--del_lnk--> Alto saxophonist <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute;s Boiarsky, who emerged in 1986 performing the film score for <i>Hombre mirando al sudeste</i> ("<!--del_lnk--> Man Facing Southeast"), records extensively to this day, collaborating with Latin jazz greats like <!--del_lnk--> Paquito D'Rivera and <!--del_lnk--> Claudio Roditi. <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Franzetti's work and arrangements for the 1992 feature film, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Mambo Kings</i>, earned him a <!--del_lnk--> Latin Grammy.</p>
       <p>The best-known Argentine jazz musician internationally is probably <!--del_lnk--> Leandro <i>Gato</i> Barbieri. The <!--del_lnk--> tenor saxophonist worked with renowned <!--del_lnk--> big band orchestra conductor <!--del_lnk--> Lalo Schifrin in the early 1960s, shortly before Schifrin became internationally known for his composition of the theme to <i><!--del_lnk--> Mission: Impossible</i>. Hired by jazz <a href="../../wp/t/Trumpet.htm" title="Trumpet">trumpeter</a> <!--del_lnk--> Don Cherry, the two recorded <i><!--del_lnk--> Complete Communion</i> in 1965, an album that secured their reputation in the jazz world. Barbieri went on to record his influential <i>Caliente!</i> (1976), an album combining Latin jazz and experimental work such as his own and <!--del_lnk--> jazz fusion great <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Santana's, as well as <i>Qu&eacute; pasa</i> (1997), which draws more deeply from Argentine folklore roots.</p>

       <p>The official national sport of Argentina is <!--del_lnk--> pato, played with a six-handle ball on horseback, but the most popular sport is association football. The <!--del_lnk--> national football team has won 25 major international titles including two <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA_World_Cup.htm" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cups</a>, two Olympic gold medals and fourteen <!--del_lnk--> Copa Am&eacute;ricas. Over one thousand Argentine players play abroad, the majority of them in European football leagues. There are 331,811 registered football players, with increasing numbers of girls and women, who have organized their own national championships since 1991 and were South American champions in 2006.</p>
       <p>Football is the most popular sport in Argentina. It is part of the country's culture. The sport is played by children during breaks at school, and by adults in both <!--del_lnk--> indoor and outdoor fields located throughout the country.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Argentina national football team has won the <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA_World_Cup.htm" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> twice (in <!--del_lnk--> 1978 and <!--del_lnk--> 1986), successive <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Summer_Olympic_Games.htm" title="Summer Olympics">Olympic</a> gold medals (in <!--del_lnk--> 2004 and <!--del_lnk--> 2008), fourteen <!--del_lnk--> Copa Am&eacute;rica, one <!--del_lnk--> Confederations Cup, and six <!--del_lnk--> Youth World Championship's. Argentine clubs have won the <!--del_lnk--> Copa Libertadores (the top continental competition) a record 22 times, and have won the <!--del_lnk--> Intercontinental Cup or the <!--del_lnk--> FIFA Club World Cup 9 times, a record shared with Brazilian clubs. The <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Primera Divisi&oacute;n is the top level domestic competition. The country's most famed national football idol historically is <a href="../../wp/d/Diego_Maradona.htm" title="Diego Maradona">Diego Maradona</a>.</p>
       <p>Argentina's fiercest rival is <!--del_lnk--> Brazil. The rivalry is sometimes known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Battle of the South Americans</i>. They have played each other numerous times in the Copa Am&eacute;rica, and in the <!--del_lnk--> Confederation Cup, and the clubs of these countries have met several times in the Copa Libertadores finals. Argentina is one of the few national teams in football that have beat Brazil on a regular basis, although in the latest years, Brazil has turned the situation in its favour. The youth teams have also met at various tournaments. At the <a href="../../wp/2/2008_Summer_Olympics.htm" title="2008 Summer Olympics">2008 Summer Olympics</a>, the under-23 teams met in the <!--del_lnk--> semi-final clash, with Argentina winning 3&ndash;0 in a hard-fought game. In addition, the abovementioned Maradona has been often compared with Brazilian iconic soccer player <!--del_lnk--> Pel&eacute;.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Women's football is far behind in terms of popularity and professionalism. Nevertheless, the <!--del_lnk--> Argentina women's national football team has competed in the <!--del_lnk--> Sudamericano Femenino since 1995, finishing as runner-up three times, before finally winning the competition in <!--del_lnk--> 2006, with a 5&ndash;0 victory over <!--del_lnk--> Brazil in the last match of the final group stage. The national team also played in the <!--del_lnk--> 2003 and the <!--del_lnk--> 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, but finished last in its group on both occasions.</p>

       <p>Although <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="UK">British</a> immigrants brought the sport to Argentina, it was not until 1977 that <!--del_lnk--> Guillermo Vilas' success made the sport popular, reaching second place in the 1975 <!--del_lnk--> ATP ranking. He was internationally recognised and was later included in the <!--del_lnk--> International Tennis Hall of Fame.</p>
       <p>During the 1980s, <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Luis Clerc (4th), <!--del_lnk--> Alberto Mancini (8th) and <!--del_lnk--> Mart&iacute;n Jaite (10th) followed Vilas and kept interest in the sport alive. Argentina won the 1980 <!--del_lnk--> World Team Cup beating Italy 3-0, and reached the final of the 1980 Davis Cup, losing to United States 3-1. In the 1990s it was <!--del_lnk--> Gabriela Sabatini who best represented Argentine tennis, becoming an international figure on and off the court.</p>
       <p>The boom of Argentine tennis players came in the 2000s, when many players became important in the circuit reaching high ranks. <!--del_lnk--> Paola Su&aacute;rez won eight <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Slam_%2528tennis%2529.htm" title="Grand Slam (tennis)">Grand Slam</a> doubles between 2001 and 2005 and was, together with <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spaniard</a> <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Ruano Pascual, the <!--del_lnk--> top women's couple for three years in a row.</p>
       <p>In 2002, <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Acasuso, <!--del_lnk--> Guillermo Ca&ntilde;as, <!--del_lnk--> Lucas Arnold and <!--del_lnk--> Gast&oacute;n Etlis won again the World Team Cup for Argentina, this time 3-0 against Russia. Five years later, Acasuso, <!--del_lnk--> Juan Ignacio Chela, <!--del_lnk--> Agust&iacute;n Calleri and <!--del_lnk--> Sebasti&aacute;n Prieto won it again, this time 2-1 against <a href="../../wp/c/Czech_Republic.htm" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> David Nalbandian lost in the final of <!--del_lnk--> Wimbledon in 2002. The <!--del_lnk--> 2004 French Open saw an Argentine final between <!--del_lnk--> Gast&oacute;n Gaudio and <!--del_lnk--> Guillermo Coria. The following year's French Open saw <!--del_lnk--> Mariano Puerta reach the final.</p>
       <p>Another example of the importance of the Argentine presence on the circuit was the August 2005 male rankings that counted five Argentine players among the top 12 (from 8th to 12th) of the ATP ranking, and three in the top ten of the Champions Race (5th, 8th and 9th). In April 2007, there were 13 Argentine male players in the ATP top 100, rivaling with the 13 Spanish, 12 French and 10 US citizens.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 2005 Tennis Masters Cup, due to a series of last-minute resignations, had four Argentine players of the total of eight, with <!--del_lnk--> Gaudio reaching semi-finals, and <!--del_lnk--> Nalbandian winning.</p>
       <p>In 2009 <!--del_lnk--> Juan Martin del Potro became the first Argentine to win the US Open since Guillermo Vilas did in 1977. That year Del Potro reached the final of the ATP World Tour Championship.</p>

       <p>Meanwhile, <!--del_lnk--> British settlers in the Argentine pampas started practising it during their free time. Among them, <!--del_lnk--> David Shennan is credited with having organised the first formal polo game of the country in 1875. The sport spread fast between the skilful <!--del_lnk--> gauchos and several clubs opened in the following years in the towns of <!--del_lnk--> Venado Tuerto, <!--del_lnk--> Ca&ntilde;ada de G&oacute;mez, <!--del_lnk--> Quilmes, <!--del_lnk--> Flores and later (1888) <!--del_lnk--> Hurlingham. In 1892 The River Plate Polo Association was founded and constituted the basis for the current Asociaci&oacute;n Argentina de Polo. In the Olympic Games held in Paris in 1924 a team composed by <!--del_lnk--> Juan Miles, <!--del_lnk--> Enrique Padilla, <!--del_lnk--> Juan Nelson, <!--del_lnk--> Arturo Kenny, <!--del_lnk--> G. Brooke Naylor and <!--del_lnk--> A. Pe&ntilde;a won the gold medal.

       <p>From then on, the game spread nationwide. Argentina has the largest number ever of <!--del_lnk--> 10 handicap players in the world.</p>
       <p>Argentina was host of the ninth edition of the World Polo Championship (for teams of up to 14 goals) at the <!--del_lnk--> Estancia Grande Polo Club, in the province of <!--del_lnk--> San Luis in October 2011.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Argentina has a number of national symbols, some of which are extensively defined by law.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> National Flag consists of three, equal in width, horizontal stripes, colored light blue, white and light blue, with the <!--del_lnk--> Sun of May in the centre of the middle, white stripe. The flag was designed by <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Belgrano in 1812; it was adopted as a national symbol 20 July 1816. The <!--del_lnk--> Coat of Arms of Argentina, which represents the union of the <!--del_lnk--> provinces, came into use in 1813 as a seal for official documents.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Argentine National Anthem, adopted in 1813, was written by <!--del_lnk--> Vicente L&oacute;pez y Planes with music by <!--del_lnk--> Blas Parera. It has been subsequently shortened to only three paragraphs, after omitting the lyrics' attacks against former occupant Spain.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Cockade of Argentina was first used during the <!--del_lnk--> May Revolution of 1810 and was made official two years later. The <!--del_lnk--> Hornero, habitating practically across all the national territory, was unanimously designated as Argentina's <!--del_lnk--> national animal in 1927. The <!--del_lnk--> ceibo is the country's designated <!--del_lnk--> national flower and <!--del_lnk--> tree, while the horseback game of <!--del_lnk--> pato is its <!--del_lnk--> national sport. The <!--del_lnk--> Schinopsis balansae was declared "National forest tree" in 1956. The <!--del_lnk--> Rhodochrosite is the national stone.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> national dishes are <!--del_lnk--> asado and <!--del_lnk--> locro, and wine the national liquor.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> The Virgin of Lujan is Argentina's <!--del_lnk--> patron saint.</p>
