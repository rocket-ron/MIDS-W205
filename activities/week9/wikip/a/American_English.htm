       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Phonology">Phonology</span></h2>
       <p>In many ways, compared to <!--del_lnk--> English English, North American English is conservative in its <!--del_lnk--> phonology. Some distinctive accents can be found on the <!--del_lnk--> East Coast (for example, in Eastern New England and New York City), partly because these areas were in contact with England, and imitated prestigious varieties of English English at a time when those varieties were undergoing changes. In addition, many speech communities on the East Coast have existed in their present locations longer than others. The interior of the United States, however, was settled by people from all regions of the existing U.S. and, as such, developed a far more generic linguistic pattern.</p>
       <p>Most North American speech is <!--del_lnk--> rhotic, as English was in most places in the 17th century. Rhoticity was further supported by <!--del_lnk--> Hiberno-English and <!--del_lnk--> Scottish English as well as the fact most regions of England at this time also had rhotic accents. In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter <i>r</i> is a <!--del_lnk--> retroflex <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x27B;]</span> or <!--del_lnk--> alveolar approximant <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x279;]</span> rather than a trill or a tap. The loss of syllable-final <i>r</i> in North America is confined mostly to the accents of <!--del_lnk--> eastern New England, <!--del_lnk--> New York City and surrounding areas, <!--del_lnk--> South Philadelphia, and the coastal portions of the <!--del_lnk--> South. In rural <!--del_lnk--> tidewater Virginia and eastern <!--del_lnk--> New England, 'r' is non-rhotic in accented (such as "bird", "work", "first", "birthday") as well as unaccented syllables, although this is declining among the younger generation of speakers. ( Dropping of syllable-final <i>r</i> sometimes happens in natively rhotic dialects if <i>r</i> is located in unaccented syllables or words and the next syllable or word begins in a consonant. In England, the lost <i>r</i> was often changed into <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x259;]</span> (<!--del_lnk--> schwa), giving rise to a new class of falling <!--del_lnk--> diphthongs. Furthermore, the <i>er</i> sound of <i>f<b>ur</b></i> or <i>butt<b>er</b></i>, is realized in AmE as a <!--del_lnk--> monophthongal <!--del_lnk--> r-colored vowel (stressed <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x25D;]</span> or unstressed <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x25A;]</span> as represented in the <!--del_lnk--> IPA). This does not happen in the non-rhotic varieties of North American speech.</p>
       <p>Some other British English changes in which most North American dialects do not participate:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The shift of <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&aelig;/</span> to <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x251;/</span> (the so-called "<!--del_lnk--> broad A") before <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/f/, /s/, /&theta;/, /&eth;/, /z/, /v/</span> alone or preceded by a <!--del_lnk--> homorganic nasal. This is the difference between the British <!--del_lnk--> Received Pronunciation and American pronunciation of <i>bath</i> and <i>dance</i>. In the United States, only eastern New England speakers took up this modification, although even there it is becoming increasingly rare.</li>
        <li>The realization of intervocalic <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/t/</span> as a glottal stop <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x294;]</span> (as in <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[b&#x252;&#x294;&#x259;l]</span> for <i>bottle</i>). This change is not universal for British English and is not considered a feature of <!--del_lnk--> Received Pronunciation. This is not a property of most North American dialects. <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland English is a notable exception.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>On the other hand, North American English has undergone some sound changes not found in Britain, especially not in its standard varieties. Many of these are instances of <!--del_lnk--> phonemic differentiation and include:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> merger of <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x251;/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x252;/</span>, making <i>father</i> and <i>bother</i> rhyme. This change is nearly universal in North American English, occurring almost everywhere except for parts of eastern New England, hence the <!--del_lnk--> Boston accent.</li>
        <li>The merger of <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x252;/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x254;/</span>. This is the so-called <!--del_lnk--> cot-caught merger, where <i>cot</i> and <i>caught</i> are <!--del_lnk--> homophones. This change has occurred in eastern New England, in <!--del_lnk--> Pittsburgh and surrounding areas, and from the <!--del_lnk--> Great Plains westward.</li>

        </div>
       </div>
       <ul>
        <li>For speakers who do not merge <i>caught</i> and <i>cot</i>: The replacement of the <i>cot</i> vowel with the <i>caught</i> vowel before <!--del_lnk--> voiceless fricatives (as in <i>cloth, off</i> [which is found in some old-fashioned varieties of RP]), as well as before <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x14B;/</span> (as in <i>strong, long),</i> usually in <i>gone,</i> often in <i>on,</i> and irregularly before <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/g/</span> <i>(log, hog, dog, fog</i> [which is not found in British English at all]).</li>
        <li>The replacement of the <i>lot</i> vowel with the <i>strut</i> vowel in most utterances of the words <i>was, of, from, what</i> and in many utterances of the words <i>everybody, nobody, somebody, anybody;</i> the word <i>because</i> has either <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x28C;/</span> or <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x254;/</span>; <i>want</i> has normally <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x254;/</span> or <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x251;/</span>, sometimes <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x28C;/</span>.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Vowel merger before intervocalic <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x279;/</span>. Which vowels are affected varies between dialects. One such change is the laxing of <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/e/</span>, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/i/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/u/</span> to <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x25B;/</span>, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x26A;/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x28A;/</span> before <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x279;/</span>, causing pronunciations like <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[p&#x25B;&#x279;]</span>, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[p&#x26A;&#x279;]</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[pj&#x28A;&#x279;]</span> for <i>pair, peer</i> and <i>pure</i>. The resulting sound <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x28A;&#x279;]</span> is often further reduced to <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x25D;]</span>, especially after <!--del_lnk--> palatals, so that <i>cure, pure, mature</i> and <i>sure</i> rhyme with <i>fir.</i></li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Dropping of <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/j/</span> after <!--del_lnk--> alveolar consonants so that <i>new, duke, Tuesday, suit, resume, lute</i> are pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/nu/</span>, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/duk/</span>, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/tuzde&#x26A;/</span>, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/sut/</span>, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x279;&#x26A;zum/</span>, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/lut/</span>.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> &aelig;-tensing in environments that vary widely from accent to accent; for example, for many speakers, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&aelig;/</span> is approximately realized as <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[e&#x259;]</span> before <!--del_lnk--> nasal consonants. In some accents, particularly those from <a href="../../wp/p/Philadelphia.htm" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> to <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&aelig;]</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[e&#x259;]</span> can even contrast sometimes, as in <i>Yes, I <b>can</b></i> <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[k&aelig;n]</span> vs. <i>tin <b>can</b></i> <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ke&#x259;n]</span>.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> flapping of intervocalic <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/t/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/d/</span> to <!--del_lnk--> alveolar tap <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x27E;]</span> before unstressed vowels (as in <i>bu<b>tt</b>er</i>, <i>par<b>t</b>y</i>) and syllabic <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/l/</span> (<i>bo<b>tt</b>le</i>), as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel (<i>wha<b>t</b> else</i>, <i>wha<b>t</b>ever</i>). Thus, for most speakers, pairs such as <i>ladder/latter, metal/medal,</i> and <i>coating/coding</i> are pronounced the same. For many speakers, this merger is incomplete and does not occur after <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/a&#x26A;/</span>; these speakers tend to pronounce <i>writer</i> with <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x259;&#x26A;]</span> and <i>rider</i> with <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[a&#x26A;]</span>. This is a form of <!--del_lnk--> Canadian raising but, unlike more extreme forms of that process, does not affect <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/a&#x28A;/</span>.</li>
        <li>Both intervocalic <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/nt/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/n/</span> may be realized as <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[n]</span> or <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x27E;&#x303;]</span>, making <i>winter</i> and <i>winner</i> homophones. This does not occur when the second syllable is stressed, as in <i>entail</i>.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> pin-pen merger, by which <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x25B;]</span> is raised to <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[&#x26A;]</span> before nasal consonants, making pairs like <i>pen/pin</i> homophonous. This merger originated in <!--del_lnk--> Southern American English but is now found in parts of the Midwest and West as well.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> merger of the vowels <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x254;/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/o/</span> before 'r', making pairs like <i>horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning,</i> etc. <!--del_lnk--> homophones.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> wine-whine merger making pairs like <i>wine/whine, wet/whet, Wales/whales, wear/where,</i> etc. <!--del_lnk--> homophones, in most cases eliminating <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/&#x28D;/</span>, the <!--del_lnk--> voiceless labiovelar fricative. Many older varieties of southern and western AmE still keep these distinct, but the merger appears to be spreading.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>North America has given the English <!--del_lnk--> lexicon many thousands of words, meanings, and phrases. Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally; others, however, died within a few years of their creation.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Creation_of_an_American_lexicon">Creation of an American lexicon</span></h3>
       <p>The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the <!--del_lnk--> Native American languages. Examples of such names are <i><!--del_lnk--> opossum, <!--del_lnk--> raccoon, <!--del_lnk--> squash</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> moose</i> (from <!--del_lnk--> Algonquian). Other Native American loanwords, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> wigwam</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> moccasin</i>, describe artificial objects in common use among Native Americans. The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, <i><!--del_lnk--> cookie, <!--del_lnk--> cruller</i>, <!--del_lnk--> stoop, and <i>pit</i> (of a fruit) from <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch Language">Dutch</a>; <i><!--del_lnk--> levee, portage</i> ("carrying of boats or goods") and (probably) <i><!--del_lnk--> gopher</i> from <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>; <i><!--del_lnk--> barbecue, <!--del_lnk--> stevedore, and <!--del_lnk--> rodeo</i> from <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>.</p>
       <p>Among the earliest and most notable regular "English" additions to the American vocabulary, dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century, are terms describing the features of the North American landscape; for instance, <i>run, branch, fork, <!--del_lnk--> snag, <!--del_lnk--> bluff, <!--del_lnk--> gulch, neck</i> (of the woods), <i>barrens, <!--del_lnk--> bottomland, notch, knob, riffle, <!--del_lnk--> rapids, watergap, cutoff, <!--del_lnk--> trail, <!--del_lnk--> timberline</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> divide</i>. Already existing words such as <i><!--del_lnk--> creek, <!--del_lnk--> slough, <!--del_lnk--> sleet</i> and (in later use) <i><!--del_lnk--> watershed</i> received new meanings that were unknown in England.</p>
       <p>Other noteworthy American toponyms are found among loanwords; for example, <i><!--del_lnk--> prairie, <!--del_lnk--> butte</i> (French); <i><!--del_lnk--> bayou</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Choctaw via Louisiana French); <i><!--del_lnk--> coulee</i> (Canadian French, but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning); <i><!--del_lnk--> canyon, <!--del_lnk--> mesa, <!--del_lnk--> arroyo</i> (Spanish); <i>vlei, <!--del_lnk--> kill</i> (Dutch, <!--del_lnk--> Hudson Valley).</p>
       <p>The word <i><!--del_lnk--> corn</i>, used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the plant <i>Zea mays</i>, the most important crop in the U.S., originally named <i><!--del_lnk--> Indian corn</i> by the earliest settlers; wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. came to be collectively referred to as <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Grain">grain</a></i> (or <i>breadstuffs</i>). Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by <i><!--del_lnk--> barn</i> (not only a building for hay and grain storage, but also for housing livestock) and <i>team</i> (not just the horses, but also the vehicle along with them), as well as, in various periods, the terms <i><!--del_lnk--> range, <!--del_lnk--> (corn) crib, <!--del_lnk--> truck, <!--del_lnk--> elevator, <!--del_lnk--> sharecropping</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> feedlot.</i></p>
       <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Ranch,</i> later applied to a <!--del_lnk--> house style, derives from <!--del_lnk--> Mexican Spanish; most Spanish contributions came indeed after the <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812, with the opening of the West. Among these are, other than toponyms, <i><!--del_lnk--> chaps</i> (from <i>chaparreras), <!--del_lnk--> plaza, <!--del_lnk--> lasso, <!--del_lnk--> bronco, <!--del_lnk--> buckaroo, <!--del_lnk--> rodeo;</i> examples of "English" additions from the <!--del_lnk--> cowboy era are <i>bad man, maverick, chuck</i> ("food") and <i><!--del_lnk--> Boot Hill;</i> from the <!--del_lnk--> California Gold Rush came such idioms as <i>hit pay dirt</i> or <i>strike it rich.</i> The word <i>blizzard</i> probably originated in the West. A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb <i>belittle</i> and the noun <i>bid,</i> both first used in writing by <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p>
       <p>With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling, and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts <i>(land office, <!--del_lnk--> lot, outlands, <!--del_lnk--> waterfront,</i> the verbs <i>locate</i> and <i>relocate, betterment, addition, subdivision),</i> types of property <i>(<!--del_lnk--> log cabin, <!--del_lnk--> adobe</i> in the 18th century; <i><!--del_lnk--> frame house, <!--del_lnk--> apartment, tenement house, <!--del_lnk--> shack, <!--del_lnk--> shanty</i> in the 19th century; <i>project, <!--del_lnk--> condominium, <!--del_lnk--> townhouse, <!--del_lnk--> split-level, <!--del_lnk--> mobile home, multi-family</i> in the 20th century), and parts thereof <i>(<!--del_lnk--> driveway, breezeway, <!--del_lnk--> backyard, dooryard; <!--del_lnk--> clapboard, <!--del_lnk--> siding, trim, <!--del_lnk--> baseboard; stoop</i> (from Dutch), <i>family room, den;</i> and, in recent years, <i><!--del_lnk--> HVAC, <!--del_lnk--> central air, walkout basement).</i></p>
       <p>Ever since the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution, a great number of terms connected with the U.S. political institutions have entered the language; examples are <i>run, gubernatorial, <!--del_lnk--> primary election, <!--del_lnk--> carpetbagger</i> (after the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>), <i>repeater, <!--del_lnk--> lame duck</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> pork barrel.</i> Some of these are internationally used (e.g. <i><!--del_lnk--> caucus, <!--del_lnk--> gerrymander, <!--del_lnk--> filibuster, <!--del_lnk--> exit poll).</i></p>
       <p>The rise of capitalism, the development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words, phrases and idioms. Typical examples are the vocabulary of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Railroad">railroading</a></i> (see further at <!--del_lnk--> rail terminology) and <i><a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transportation</a></i> terminology, ranging from names of roads (from <i>dirt roads</i> and <i>back roads</i> to <i><!--del_lnk--> freeways</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> parkways)</i> to road infrastructure <i>(<!--del_lnk--> parking lot, <!--del_lnk--> overpass, <!--del_lnk--> rest area),</i> and from <!--del_lnk--> automotive terminology to <i><!--del_lnk--> public transit</i> (e.g. in the sentence "<i>riding</i> the <i>subway downtown</i>"); such American introductions as <i>commuter</i> (from <i>commutation ticket), <!--del_lnk--> concourse, to board</i> (a vehicle), <i>to park, double-park</i> and <i>parallel park</i> (a car), <i><!--del_lnk--> double decker</i> or the noun <i>terminal</i> have long been used in all dialects of English. Trades of various kinds have endowed (American) English with household words describing jobs and occupations <i>(<!--del_lnk--> bartender, longshoreman, patrolman, <!--del_lnk--> hobo, <!--del_lnk--> bouncer, bellhop, <!--del_lnk--> roustabout, <!--del_lnk--> white collar, <!--del_lnk--> blue collar, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Employment.htm" title="Employee">employee</a>, boss</i> [from Dutch], <i><!--del_lnk--> intern, <!--del_lnk--> busboy, <!--del_lnk--> mortician, <!--del_lnk--> senior citizen),</i> businesses and workplaces <i>(<!--del_lnk--> department store, <!--del_lnk--> supermarket, <!--del_lnk--> thrift store, <!--del_lnk--> gift shop, <!--del_lnk--> drugstore, <!--del_lnk--> motel, <!--del_lnk--> main street, <!--del_lnk--> gas station, <!--del_lnk--> hardware store, <!--del_lnk--> savings and loan, hock</i> [also from Dutch]), as well as general concepts and innovations <i>(<a href="../../wp/a/Automated_teller_machine.htm" title="Automated teller machine">automated teller machine</a>, <!--del_lnk--> smart card, <!--del_lnk--> cash register, <!--del_lnk--> dishwasher, reservation</i> [as at hotels], <i>pay envelope, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Movie">movie</a>, mileage, <!--del_lnk--> shortage, <!--del_lnk--> outage, <!--del_lnk--> blood bank).</i></p>
       <p>Already existing English words &mdash;such as <i><!--del_lnk--> store, <!--del_lnk--> shop, dry goods, <!--del_lnk--> haberdashery, <!--del_lnk--> lumber</i>&mdash; underwent shifts in meaning; some &mdash;such as <i><!--del_lnk--> mason, student, <!--del_lnk--> clerk</i>, the verbs <i>can</i> (as in "canned goods"), <i>ship, fix, carry, enroll</i> (as in school), <i>run</i> (as in "run a business"), <i>release</i> and <i>haul</i>&mdash; were given new significations, while others (such as <i><!--del_lnk--> tradesman)</i> have retained meanings that disappeared in England. From the world of business and finance came <i><!--del_lnk--> breakeven, <!--del_lnk--> merger, <!--del_lnk--> delisting, <!--del_lnk--> downsize, <!--del_lnk--> disintermediation, <!--del_lnk--> bottom line;</i> from sports terminology came, jargon aside, <i>Monday-morning quarterback, cheap shot, game plan</i> (<a href="../../wp/a/American_football.htm" title="American football">football</a>); <i>in the <!--del_lnk--> ballpark, out of <!--del_lnk--> left field, off base, hit and run,</i> and <!--del_lnk--> many other idioms from <a href="../../wp/b/Baseball.htm" title="Baseball">baseball</a>; gamblers coined <i><!--del_lnk--> bluff, <!--del_lnk--> blue chip, <!--del_lnk--> ante, bottom dollar, raw deal, pass the buck, ace in the hole, freeze-out, showdown;</i> miners coined <i><!--del_lnk--> bedrock, bonanza, peter out, pan out</i> and the verb <i>prospect</i> from the noun; and railroadmen are to be credited with <i>make the <!--del_lnk--> grade, sidetrack, head-on,</i> and the verb <i>railroad.</i> A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America: <i><!--del_lnk--> elevator, <!--del_lnk--> ground, <!--del_lnk--> gasoline;</i> many automotive terms fall in this category, although many do not <i>(<!--del_lnk--> hatchback, <!--del_lnk--> SUV, <!--del_lnk--> station wagon, <!--del_lnk--> tailgate, <!--del_lnk--> motorhome, <!--del_lnk--> truck, <!--del_lnk--> pickup truck, to exhaust).</i></p>
       <p>In addition to the above-mentioned loans from French, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Dutch, and Native American languages, other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration; notably, from <!--del_lnk--> Yiddish <i>(<!--del_lnk--> chutzpah, schmooze</i> and such idioms as <i>need something like a hole in the head)</i> and <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> &mdash;<i><!--del_lnk--> hamburger</i> and culinary terms like <i>frankfurter/franks, liverwurst, sauerkraut, <!--del_lnk--> wiener, <!--del_lnk--> deli(catessen); <!--del_lnk--> scram, <!--del_lnk--> kindergarten, <!--del_lnk--> gesundheit;</i> musical terminology <i>(<!--del_lnk--> whole note, <!--del_lnk--> half note,</i> etc.); and apparently <i><!--del_lnk--> cookbook, fresh</i> ("impudent") and <i>what gives?</i> Such constructions as <i>Are you coming with?</i> and <i>I like to dance</i> (for "I like dancing") may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence.</p>
       <p>Finally, a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from <i><!--del_lnk--> OK</i> and <i>cool</i> to <i><!--del_lnk--> nerd</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> 24/7),</i> while others have not <i>(<!--del_lnk--> have a nice day, sure);</i> many are now distinctly old-fashioned <i>(swell, groovy).</i> Some English words now in general use, such as <i>hijacking, <!--del_lnk--> disc jockey, boost, bulldoze</i> and <i><a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a>,</i> originated as American slang. Among the many English idioms of U.S. origin are <i>get the hang of, take for a ride, bark up the wrong tree, keep tabs, run scared, take a backseat, have an edge over, stake a claim, take a shine to, in on the ground floor, bite off more than one can chew, off/on the wagon, stay put, inside track, <!--del_lnk--> stiff upper lip, bad hair day, <!--del_lnk--> throw a monkey wrench, under the weather, jump bail, come clean, come again?, it ain't over till it's over, what goes around comes around,</i> and <i>will the real x please stand up?</i></p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Morphology">Morphology</span></h3>
       <p>American English has always shown a marked tendency <!--del_lnk--> to use substantives as verbs. Examples of verbed nouns are <i>interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, expense, room, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, buffalo, weasel, express</i> (mail), <i>belly-ache, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, merchandise, service</i> (as a car), <i>corner, torch, exit</i> (as in "exit the lobby"), <i>factor</i> (in mathematics), <i>gun</i> ("shoot"), <i>author</i> (which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U.S. three centuries later) and, out of American material, <i>proposition, graft</i> (bribery), <i>bad-mouth, <!--del_lnk--> vacation, major, <!--del_lnk--> backpack, <!--del_lnk--> backtrack, intern, ticket</i> (traffic violations), <i>hassle, <!--del_lnk--> blacktop, peer-review, dope</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> OD.</i></p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Compounds coined in the U.S. are for instance <i><!--del_lnk--> foothill, <!--del_lnk--> flatlands, <!--del_lnk--> badlands, <!--del_lnk--> landslide</i> (in all senses), <i><!--del_lnk--> overview</i> (the noun), <i><!--del_lnk--> backdrop, <!--del_lnk--> teenager, <!--del_lnk--> brainstorm, <!--del_lnk--> bandwagon, <!--del_lnk--> hitchhike, smalltime, <!--del_lnk--> deadbeat, <!--del_lnk--> frontman, lowbrow</i> and <i>highbrow, hell-bent, foolproof, nitpick, about-face</i> (later verbed), <i>upfront</i> (in all senses), <i>fixer-upper, no-show;</i> many of these are phrases used as adverbs or (often) hyphenated attributive adjectives: <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nonprofit_organization.htm" title="Non-profit">non-profit</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Business.htm" title="For-profit">for-profit</a>, free-for-all, ready-to-wear, catchall, low-down, down-and-out, down and dirty, in-your-face, nip and tuck;</i> many compound nouns and adjectives are open: <i><!--del_lnk--> happy hour, <!--del_lnk--> fall guy, <!--del_lnk--> capital gain, <!--del_lnk--> road trip, wheat pit, head start, <!--del_lnk--> plea bargain;</i> some of these are colorful <i>(<!--del_lnk--> empty nester, <!--del_lnk--> loan shark, <!--del_lnk--> ambulance chaser, <!--del_lnk--> buzz saw, <!--del_lnk--> ghetto blaster, dust bunny),</i> others are euphemistic <i>(<!--del_lnk--> differently abled, <!--del_lnk--> human resources, physically challenged, <!--del_lnk--> affirmative action, <!--del_lnk--> correctional facility).</i></p>
       <p>Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition: <i><!--del_lnk--> add-on, stopover, lineup, <!--del_lnk--> shakedown, tryout, <!--del_lnk--> spinoff, <!--del_lnk--> rundown</i> ("summary"), <i><!--del_lnk--> shootout, <!--del_lnk--> holdup, hideout, comeback, cookout, <!--del_lnk--> kickback, <!--del_lnk--> makeover, <!--del_lnk--> takeover, rollback</i> ("decrease"), <i>rip-off, come-on, shoo-in, fix-up, tie-in, tie-up</i> ("stoppage"), <i>stand-in.</i> These essentially are nouned <!--del_lnk--> phrasal verbs; some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin <i>(spell out, figure out, hold up, brace up, size up, rope in, back up/off/down/out, step down, miss out on, kick around, cash in, rain out, check in</i> and <i>check out</i> (in all senses), <i>fill in</i> ("inform"), <i>kick in</i> ("contribute"), <i>square off, sock in, sock away, factor in/out, come down with, give up on, lay off</i> (from employment), <i>run into</i> and <i>across</i> ("meet"), <i>stop by, pass up, put up</i> (money), <i>set up</i> ("frame"), <i>trade in, pick up on, pick up after, lose out.</i></p>
       <p>Noun endings such as <i>-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)</i> and <i>-cian (beautician)</i> are also particularly productive. Some verbs ending in <i>-ize</i> are of U.S. origin; for example, <i>fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, <!--del_lnk--> weatherize, winterize, <!--del_lnk--> Mirandize;</i> and so are some <!--del_lnk--> back-formations <i>(locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve</i> and <i>enthuse).</i> Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are <i>as of</i> (with dates and times), <i>outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to&hellip;, not to be about to</i> and <i>lack for.</i></p>
       <p>Americanisms formed by alteration of existing words include notably <i>pesky, phony, rambunctious, pry</i> (as in "pry open," from <i>prize), putter</i> (verb), <i>buddy, <!--del_lnk--> sundae, skeeter, sashay</i> and <i>kitty-corner.</i> Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are for example, <i>lengthy, bossy, <!--del_lnk--> cute</i> and <i>cutesy, grounded</i> (of a child), <i>punk</i> (in all senses), <i>sticky</i> (of the weather), <i>through</i> (as in "through train," or meaning "finished"), and many colloquial forms such as <i>peppy</i> or <i>wacky</i>. American <!--del_lnk--> blends include <i><!--del_lnk--> motel, guesstimate, <!--del_lnk--> infomercial</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> televangelist.</i></p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="English_words_that_survived_in_the_United_States">English words that survived in the United States</span></h3>
       <p>A number of words and meanings that originated in <!--del_lnk--> Middle English or <!--del_lnk--> Early Modern English and that always have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in <!--del_lnk--> Lowland Scots. Terms such as <i>fall</i> ("<a href="../../wp/a/Autumn.htm" title="Autumn">autumn</a>"), <i><!--del_lnk--> pavement</i> (to mean "road surface", where in Britain, as in Philadelphia, it is the equivalent of "sidewalk"), <i><!--del_lnk--> faucet, <!--del_lnk--> diaper, <!--del_lnk--> candy, <!--del_lnk--> skillet, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Glasses.htm" title="Eyeglasses">eyeglasses</a>, <!--del_lnk--> crib</i> (for a baby), <i>obligate,</i> and <i>raise a child</i> are often regarded as Americanisms. <i>Gotten</i> (<!--del_lnk--> past participle of <i>get</i>) is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of Britain, such as Lancashire and Yorkshire, that still continue to use it and sometimes also use <i>putten</i> as the past participle for <i>put.</i></p>
       <p>Other words and meanings, to various extents, were brought back to Britain, especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include <i>hire</i> ("to employ"), <i>quit</i> ("to stop," which spawned <i>quitter</i> in the U.S.), <i>I guess</i> (famously criticized by <!--del_lnk--> H. W. Fowler), <i><!--del_lnk--> baggage</i>, <i>hit</i> (a place), and the adverbs <i>overly</i> and <i>presently</i> ("currently"). Some of these, for example <i><!--del_lnk--> monkey wrench</i> and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Waste_container.htm" title="Wastebasket">wastebasket</a></i>, originated in 19th-century Britain.</p>
       <p>The mandative <!--del_lnk--> subjunctive (as in "the City Attorney suggested that the case <i>not be closed</i>") is livelier in AmE than it is in British English; it appears in some areas as a spoken usage, and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal. The adjectives <i>mad</i> meaning "angry", <i>smart</i> meaning "intelligent", and <i>sick</i> meaning "ill" are also more frequent in American than British English.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Regional_differences">Regional differences</span></h2>
       <p>While written AmE is standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary. <i><!--del_lnk--> General American</i> is the name given to any American accent that is relatively free of noticeable regional influences.</p>
       <p>After the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the Eastern U.S. led to dialect mixing and leveling, so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern seaboard. The <!--del_lnk--> Connecticut River and <!--del_lnk--> Long Island Sound is usually regarded as the southern/western extent of New England speech, which has its roots in the speech of the Puritans from <!--del_lnk--> East Anglia who settled in the <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Bay Colony. The <!--del_lnk--> Potomac River generally divides a group of Northern coastal dialects from the beginning of the Coastal Southern dialect area; in between these two rivers several local variations exist, chief among them the one that prevails in and around <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> and northern <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey, which developed on a Dutch <!--del_lnk--> substratum after the British conquered New Amsterdam. The main features of Coastal Southern speech can be traced to the speech of the English from the <!--del_lnk--> West Country who settled in Virginia after leaving England at the time of the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Civil_War.htm" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>, and to the <!--del_lnk--> African influences from the African Americans who were enslaved in the South.</p>
       <p>Although no longer region-specific, <!--del_lnk--> African American Vernacular English, which remains prevalent among <!--del_lnk--> African Americans, has a close relationship to Southern varieties of AmE and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans.</p>
       <p>A distinctive speech pattern was also generated by the separation of <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> from the United States, centered on the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region. This is the <!--del_lnk--> Inland North Dialect&mdash;the "standard Midwestern" speech that was the basis for General American in the mid-20th Century (although it has been recently modified by the <!--del_lnk--> northern cities vowel shift). Those not from this area frequently confuse it with the North Midland dialect treated below, referring to both collectively as "Midwestern." The so-called "Minnesota Nice" dialect is also prevalent in the upper Midwest, and is characterized by influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region (yah for yes/ja in German, pronounced the same way).</p>
       <p>In the interior, the situation is very different. West of the <!--del_lnk--> Appalachian Mountains begins the broad zone of what is generally called "<!--del_lnk--> Midland" speech. This is divided into two discrete subdivisions, the North Midland that begins north of the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio River valley area, and the South Midland speech; sometimes the former is designated simply "Midland" and the latter is reckoned as "Highland Southern." The North Midland speech continues to expand westward until it becomes the closely related Western dialect which contains <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Northwest English as well as the well-known <!--del_lnk--> California English, although in the immediate <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco.htm" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> area some older speakers do not possess the <!--del_lnk--> cot-caught merger and thus retain the distinction between words such as cot and caught which reflects a historical Mid-Atlantic heritage. Mormon and Mexican settlers in the West influenced the development of <!--del_lnk--> Utah English.</p>
       <p>The South Midland or Highland Southern dialect follows the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio River in a generally southwesterly direction, moves across <!--del_lnk--> Arkansas and <!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma west of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi river">Mississippi</a>, and peters out in <!--del_lnk--> West Texas. It is a version of the Midland speech that has assimilated some coastal Southern forms (outsiders often mistakenly believe South Midland speech and coastal South speech to be the same).</p>
       <p>The island state of Hawaii has a distinctive <!--del_lnk--> Hawaiian Pidgin.</p>
       <p>Finally, dialect development in the United States has been notably influenced by the distinctive speech of such important cultural centers as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Boston.htm" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Philadelphia.htm" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Charleston, <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans, and <a href="../../wp/d/Detroit.htm" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>, which imposed their marks on the surrounding areas.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_between_British_English_and_American_English">Differences between British English and American English</span></h2>
       <p>American English and <!--del_lnk--> British English (BrE) differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a lesser extent, grammar and orthography. The first large American dictionary, <i><!--del_lnk--> An American Dictionary of the English Language</i>, was written by <!--del_lnk--> Noah Webster in 1828; Webster intended to show that the United States, which was a relatively new country at the time, spoke a different dialect from that of Britain.</p>
       <p>Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and normally do not affect mutual intelligibility; these include, but are not limited to: different use of some <!--del_lnk--> verbal auxiliaries; formal (rather than notional) agreement with <!--del_lnk--> collective nouns; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (e.g. <i>learn</i>, <i>burn</i>, <i>sneak</i>, <i>dive</i>, <i>get</i>); different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (e.g. AmE <i>in school</i>, BrE <i>at school</i>); and whether or not a definite article is used in a few cases (AmE <i>to the hospital</i>, BrE <i>to hospital</i>). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other.</p>
       <p>Differences in <!--del_lnk--> orthography are also trivial. Some of the forms that now serve to distinguish American from British spelling (<i>colour</i> for <i>colour</i>, <i>centre</i> for <i>centre</i>, <i>traveler</i> for <i>traveller</i>, etc.) were introduced by Noah Webster himself; others are due to spelling tendencies in Britain from the 17th century until the present day (e.g. <i>-ise</i> for <i>-ize</i> (although the Oxford English Dictionary still prefers the <i>-ize</i> ending), <i>programme</i> for <i>program</i>, <i>skilful</i> for <i>skillful</i>, <i>chequered</i> for <i>checkered</i>, etc.), in some cases favored by the <!--del_lnk--> francophile tastes of 19th century <!--del_lnk--> Victorian England, which had little effect on AmE.</p>
       <p>The most noticeable differences between AmE and BrE are at the levels of pronunciation and vocabulary.</p>
