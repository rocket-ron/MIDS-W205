The name derives from the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greek.htm" title="Ancient Greek">ancient Greek</a> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><!--del_lnk--> &#x1F00;&rho;&chi;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> (<i>archa&#x12B;os</i>) meaning "ancient", and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><!--del_lnk--> &pi;&tau;&#x3AD;&rho;&upsilon;&xi;</span> (<i>pt&eacute;ryx</i>), meaning "feather" or "wing". Since the late 19th century, it has been generally accepted by palaeontologists, and celebrated in lay reference works, as being the oldest known bird (<!--del_lnk--> Avialae).</p>
       <p><i>Archaeopteryx</i> lived in the <!--del_lnk--> Late Jurassic <!--del_lnk--> period around 150&nbsp;million years ago, in what is now southern <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> during a time when <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> was an archipelago of islands in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the <a href="../../wp/e/Equator.htm" title="Equator">equator</a> than it is now. Similar in shape to a <!--del_lnk--> European Magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a <a href="../../wp/r/Raven.htm" title="Raven">raven</a>, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> could grow to about 0.5&nbsp;m (1&nbsp;ft&nbsp;8&nbsp;in) in length. Despite its small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> has more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than it does with <!--del_lnk--> modern birds. In particular, it shares the following features with the <!--del_lnk--> deinonychosaurs (<!--del_lnk--> dromaeosaurs and <!--del_lnk--> troodontids): jaws with sharp teeth, three fingers with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which also suggest <!--del_lnk--> homeothermy), and various skeletal features.</p>
       <p>These features make <i>Archaeopteryx</i> a clear candidate for a <!--del_lnk--> transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds. Thus, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> plays an important role not only in the study of the <!--del_lnk--> origin of birds but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a <a href="../../wp/f/Feather.htm" title="Feather">feather</a> in 1861. That same year, the first complete specimen of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, though this is still debated.</p>
       <p>Most of these eleven fossils include impressions of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form (<!--del_lnk--> flight feathers), these fossils are evidence that the evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic. The <!--del_lnk--> type specimen of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was discovered just two years after <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> published <i><a href="../../wp/o/On_the_Origin_of_Species.htm" title="On the Origin of Species">On the Origin of Species</a></i>. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a>.</p>

       <p><i>Archaeopteryx</i> lived during the early <!--del_lnk--> Tithonian <!--del_lnk--> stage of the <a href="../../wp/j/Jurassic.htm" title="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> period, around 150.8&ndash;148.5&nbsp;million years ago. Most of the specimens of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> that have been discovered come from the <!--del_lnk--> Solnhofen limestone in <!--del_lnk--> Bavaria, southern <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, which is a <i><!--del_lnk--> lagerst&auml;tte</i>, a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils.</p>
       <p><i>Archaeopteryx</i> was roughly the size of a <a href="../../wp/r/Raven.htm" title="Raven">raven</a>, with broad wings that were rounded at the ends and a long tail compared to its body length. It could reach up to 500 millimetres (20&nbsp;in) in body length, with an estimated weight of 0.8 to 1 kilogram (1.8 to 2.2 lb). <i>Archaeopteryx</i> feathers, although less documented than its other features, were very similar in structure and design to modern-day bird feathers. However, despite the presence of numerous avian features, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> had many <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">theropod dinosaur</a> characteristics. Unlike modern birds, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> had small teeth as well as a long bony tail, features which <i>Archaeopteryx</i> shared with other dinosaurs of the time.</p>
       <p>Because it displays a number of features common to both birds and dinosaurs, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> has often been considered a link between them. In the 1970s, <!--del_lnk--> John Ostrom, following <!--del_lnk--> T. H. Huxley's lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had a number of avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings and a partially reversed first toe, and a number of dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the <!--del_lnk--> ankle bone, <!--del_lnk--> interdental plates, an <!--del_lnk--> obturator process of the <!--del_lnk--> ischium, and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was remarkably similar to the theropod family <!--del_lnk--> Dromaeosauridae.</p>
       <p>The first remains of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> were discovered in 1861, just two years after <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> published <i><a href="../../wp/o/On_the_Origin_of_Species.htm" title="On the Origin of Species">On the Origin of Species</a></i>. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the <!--del_lnk--> origin of birds, the <!--del_lnk--> transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. Indeed, further research on dinosaurs from the <!--del_lnk--> Gobi Desert and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> has since provided more evidence of a link between <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and the dinosaurs, such as the Chinese <!--del_lnk--> feathered dinosaurs. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is close to the ancestry of modern birds, and it shows most of the features one would expect in an ancestral bird. However, it may not be the direct ancestor of living birds, and it is uncertain how much evolutionary divergence was already present among other birds at the time.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Specimens of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> were most notable for their well-developed <!--del_lnk--> flight feathers. They were markedly asymmetrical and showed the structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Feather.htm" title="Barb (feather)">barb</a>-<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Feather.htm" title="Barbule">barbule</a>-barbicel arrangement. The tail feathers were less asymmetrical, again in line with the situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The <!--del_lnk--> thumb, however, did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of <!--del_lnk--> stiff feathers.</p>
       <p>The body plumage of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is less well documented and has only been properly researched in the well-preserved Berlin specimen. Thus, as more than one species seems to be involved, the research into the Berlin specimen's feathers does not necessarily hold true for the rest of the species of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. In the Berlin specimen, there are "trousers" of well-developed feathers on the legs; some of these feathers seem to have a basic contour feather structure but are somewhat decomposed (they lack <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Feather.htm" title="Barbicel">barbicels</a> as in <!--del_lnk--> ratites). However, in part they are firm and thus capable of supporting flight.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>There was a patch of <!--del_lnk--> pennaceous feathers running along the back which was quite similar to the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm, though not as stiff as the flight-related feathers. Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited to a sort of "proto-<!--del_lnk--> down" not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur <i><!--del_lnk--> Sinosauropteryx</i>, being decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appeared more like fur than like feathers in life (though not in their microscopic structure). These occur on the remainder of the body, as far as such structures are both preserved and not obliterated by preparation, and the lower neck.</p>
       <p>However, there is no indication of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these may conceivably have been nude, this may still be an artifact of preservation. It appears that most <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimens became embedded in <!--del_lnk--> anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their back in the sea &mdash; the head and neck and the tail are generally bent downwards, which suggests that the specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin was already softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In 2011, graduate student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimen. Using <!--del_lnk--> scanning electron microscopy technology and <!--del_lnk--> energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, the team was able to detect the structure of <!--del_lnk--> melanosomes in the single-feather specimen described in 1861. The resultant structure was then compared to that of 87 modern bird species and was determined with a high percentage of likelihood to be black in colour. The feather studied was most probably a single <!--del_lnk--> covert, which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. While the study does not mean that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was entirely black, it does suggest that it had some black colouration which included the coverts. Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Flight">Flight</span></h3>
       <p>As in the wings of modern birds, the flight feathers of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation. However, it is unclear whether <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was simply a glider or capable of flapping flight. The lack of a bony <!--del_lnk--> breastbone suggests that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike <!--del_lnk--> coracoids, or perhaps to a <!--del_lnk--> cartilaginous <!--del_lnk--> sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between <!--del_lnk--> scapula, <!--del_lnk--> coracoid and <!--del_lnk--> humerus &mdash; instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds &mdash; might indicate that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by <!--del_lnk--> Philip Senter in 2006 <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have utilized a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.</p>
       <p><i>Archaeopteryx</i> wings were relatively large, which would have resulted in a low stall speed and reduced <!--del_lnk--> turning radius. The short and rounded shape of the wings would have increased drag, but could also have improved <i>Archaeopteryx'</i> ability to fly through cluttered environments such as trees and brush (similar wing shapes are seen in birds which fly through trees and brush, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Crow.htm" title="Crows">crows</a> and <!--del_lnk--> pheasants). The presence of "hind wings", asymmetrical flight feathers stemming from the legs similar to those seen in dromaeosaurids such as <i><a href="../../wp/m/Microraptor.htm" title="Microraptor">Microraptor</a></i>, would also have added to the aerial mobility of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. The first detailed study of the hind wings by Longrich in 2006 suggested that the structures formed up to 12% of the total <!--del_lnk--> airfoil. This would have reduced stall speed by up to 6% and turning radius by up to 12%.</p>
       <p>The feathers of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> were asymmetrical. This has been interpreted as evidence that it was a flyer, as flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. However, some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers, and that the feathers of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> fall into this range. However, the degree of asymmetry with <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In 2010, Robert L. Nudds and Gareth J. Dyke in the journal <i>Science</i> published a paper in which they analysed the <!--del_lnk--> rachises of the primary feathers of <i><!--del_lnk--> Confuciusornis</i> and <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. The analysis suggested that the rachises on these two genera were thinner and weaker than those compared to modern birds relative to body weight. The authors determined that <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, along with <i>Confuciusornis</i>, were unable to use flapping flight. This study, however, was criticized by <!--del_lnk--> Philip J. Currie and Luis Chiappe. Chiappe suggested that it is difficult to measure the rachises of fossilized feathers, and Currie speculated that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Confuciusornis</i> must have been able to fly to some degree, as their fossils are preserved in what is believed to have been in marine or lake sediments, suggesting that they must have been able to fly over deep water. <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Paul also disagreed with the study, arguing in a 2010 response that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the weights of these early birds, and that more accurate weight estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow rachises. Nudds and Dyke had assumed a weight of 250&nbsp;grams for the Munich specimen <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, a young juvenile, based on published weight estimates of larger specimens. Paul argued that a more reasonable body weight estimate for the Munich specimen is about 140&nbsp;grams. Paul also criticized the measurements of the rachises themselves, noting that the feathers in the Munich specimen are poorly preserved. Nudds and Dyke reported a diameter of 0.75 millimetre (0.030 <abbr class="abbr" title="inch">in</abbr>) for the longest primary feather, which Paul could not confirm using photographs. Paul measured some of the inner primary feathers, finding rachises <span class="nowrap">1.25&ndash;1.4&nbsp;mm</span> across. Despite these criticisms, Nudds and Dyke stood by their original conclusions. They claimed that Paul's statement that an adult <i>Archaeopteryx</i> would have been a better flyer than the juvenile Munich specimen was dubious. This, they reasoned, would require even thicker rachis, evidence for which has not yet been presented. Another possibility is that they hadn't achieved true flight, but instead used their wings as aids for extra lift while running over water after the fashion of the basilisk lizard - which could explain their presence in lake and marine deposits - see <!--del_lnk--> Evolution of Bird Flight.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In 2004, scientists analyzing a detailed <!--del_lnk--> CT scan of the <!--del_lnk--> braincase of the London <i>Archaeopteryx</i> concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of the inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception and coordination needed to fly. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% of the way to modern birds from the condition of non-<!--del_lnk--> coelurosaurian dinosaurs like <i><!--del_lnk--> Carcharodontosaurus</i> or <i><a href="../../wp/a/Allosaurus.htm" title="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a></i>, which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear.</p>
       <p><i>Archaeopteryx</i> continues to play an important part in scientific debates about the origin and evolution of birds. Some scientists see it as a semi-arboreal climbing animal, following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the "trees down" hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by <!--del_lnk--> O. C. Marsh). Other scientists see <i>Archaeopteryx</i> as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the "ground up" hypothesis proposed by <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Wendell Williston). Still others suggest that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> might have been at home both in the trees and on the ground, like modern crows, and this latter view is what today is considered best-supported by morphological characters. Altogether, it appears that the species was not particularly specialized for running on the ground or for perching. A scenario outlined by El&#x17C;anowski in 2002 suggested that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> used its wings mainly to escape <!--del_lnk--> predators by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches, and alternatively to cover longer distances by (mainly) gliding down from cliffs or treetops.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>A <!--del_lnk--> histological study by Erickson, Norell, Zhongue and others in 2009 showed that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, based on growth lines found in slices of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> bones. According to their study, all known skeletons of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> came from juvenile specimens. They estimated that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> reached adult size in about 970 days (about 2 years and 8 months), and weighed between <span class="nowrap">0.8 &ndash; 1 kilogram</span>. The study also found that the birds <i><!--del_lnk--> Jeholornis</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Sapeornis</i> grew slowly, as did the dromaeosaurid <i><!--del_lnk--> Mahakala</i>. The birds <i><!--del_lnk--> Confuciusornis</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Ichthyornis</i>, however, grew very quickly, following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds. One of the few modern birds which exhibit slow growth is the flightless <!--del_lnk--> kiwi, and the authors speculated that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and the kiwi had similar <!--del_lnk--> metabolisms.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Daily_activity_patterns">Daily activity patterns</span></h3>
       <p>Comparisons between the <!--del_lnk--> scleral rings of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and modern birds and reptiles indicate that it may have been <!--del_lnk--> diurnal, similar to most modern birds.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Paleoecology">Paleoecology</span></h2>
       <p>The richness and diversity of the <!--del_lnk--> Solnhofen limestones in which all specimens of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> have been found have shed light on an ancient Jurassic Bavaria strikingly different from the present day. The latitude was similar to <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>, though the climate was likely to have been drier, as evidenced by fossils of plants with adaptations for arid conditions and lack of terrestrial sediments characteristic of rivers. Evidence of plants, though scarce, include <!--del_lnk--> cycads and conifers while animals found include a large number of insects, small lizards, <a href="../../wp/p/Pterosaur.htm" title="Pterosaur">pterosaurs</a> and <i><a href="../../wp/c/Compsognathus.htm" title="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a></i>.</p>
       <p>The excellent preservation of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> fossils and other terrestrial fossils found at <!--del_lnk--> Solnhofen indicates that they did not travel far before becoming preserved. The <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimens found are likely therefore to have lived on the low islands surrounding the Solnhofen lagoon rather than been corpses that drifted in from farther away. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> skeletons are considerably less numerous in the deposits of Solnhofen than those of pterosaurs, of which seven genera have been found. The pterosaurs included species such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Rhamphorhynchus</i> belonging to the <!--del_lnk--> Rhamphorhynchidae, the group which dominated the <!--del_lnk--> niche currently occupied by <!--del_lnk--> seabirds, and which became extinct at the end of the Jurassic. The pterosaurs, which also included <i><!--del_lnk--> Pterodactylus</i>, were common enough that it is unlikely that the specimens found are <!--del_lnk--> vagrants from the larger islands 50&nbsp;km (31&nbsp;mi) to the north.</p>
       <p>The islands that surrounded the Solnhofen lagoon were low lying, <!--del_lnk--> semi-arid and sub-<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tropics.htm" title="Tropical">tropical</a> with a long <!--del_lnk--> dry season and little rain. The closest modern analogue for the Solnhofen conditions is said to be <!--del_lnk--> Orca Basin in the northern <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, though that is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons. The <!--del_lnk--> flora of these islands was adapted to these dry conditions and consisted mostly of low (3&nbsp;m [10&nbsp;ft]) shrubs. Contrary to reconstructions of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> climbing large trees, these seem to have been mostly absent from the islands; few trunks have been found in the sediments and fossilized tree <!--del_lnk--> pollen is also absent.</p>
       <p>The lifestyle of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is difficult to reconstruct and there are several theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does not preclude <i>Archaeopteryx</i> from an arboreal lifestyle as several species of extant bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as alongside the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The initial discovery, a single feather, was unearthed in 1860 or 1861 and described in 1861 by <!--del_lnk--> Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer. It is currently located at the <!--del_lnk--> Humboldt Museum f&uuml;r Naturkunde in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>. This is generally assigned to <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and was the initial <!--del_lnk--> holotype, but whether it actually is a feather of this species or another, as yet undiscovered, proto-bird is unknown. There are some indications it is indeed not from the same animal as most of the skeletons (the "typical" <i>A. lithographica</i>).</p>
       <p>The first skeleton, known as the <b>London Specimen</b> (BMNH 37001), was unearthed in 1861 near <!--del_lnk--> Langenaltheim, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and perhaps given to a local physician Karl H&auml;berlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for &pound;700 to the <!--del_lnk--> Natural History Museum in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, where it remains. Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by <!--del_lnk--> Richard Owen as <i>Archaeopteryx macrura</i>, allowing for the possibility it did not belong to the same species as the feather. In the subsequent 4th edition of his <i><a href="../../wp/o/On_the_Origin_of_Species.htm" title="On the Origin of Species">On the Origin of Species</a></i>, <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> described how some authors had maintained "that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archeopteryx, with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world."</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greek.htm" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a> term "pteryx" (<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">&pi;&tau;&#x3AD;&rho;&upsilon;&xi;</span>) primarily means "wing", but can also designate merely "feather". Von Meyer suggested this in his description. At first he referred to a single feather which appeared like a modern bird's <!--del_lnk--> remex (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> specimen, to which he referred as a "<i>Skelet eines mit &auml;hnlichen Federn bedeckten <span lang="deu" xml:lang="deu">Thieres</span></i>" ("skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers"). In <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, this ambiguity is resolved by the term <i>Schwinge</i> which does not necessarily mean a wing used for flying. <i>Urschwinge</i> was the favored translation of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> among German scholars in the late 19th century. In <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, "ancient pinion" offers a rough approximation.</p>
       <p>Since then ten specimens have been recovered:</p>
       <p>The <b>Berlin Specimen</b> (HMN 1880) was discovered in 1874 or 1875 on the Blumenberg near <!--del_lnk--> Eichst&auml;tt, Germany, by farmer Jakob Niemeyer. He sold this precious <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossil</a> for the money to buy a cow in 1876, to inn-keeper Johann D&ouml;rr, who again sold it to Ernst Otto H&auml;berlein, the son of K. H&auml;berlein. Placed on sale between 1877 and 1881, with potential buyers including <!--del_lnk--> O. C. Marsh of <!--del_lnk--> Yale University's Peabody Museum, it was eventually bought by the Humboldt Museum f&uuml;r Naturkunde, where it is now displayed, for 20,000 <!--del_lnk--> Goldmark. The transaction was financed by <!--del_lnk--> Ernst Werner von Siemens, founder of the <!--del_lnk--> famous company that bears his name. Described in 1884 by <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Dames, it is the most complete specimen, and the first with a complete head. It was in 1897 named by Dames as a new species, <i>A. siemensii</i>; a recent evaluation supports the <i>A. siemensii</i> species identification.</p>

       <p>The <b>Haarlem Specimen</b> (TM 6428, also known as the <i>Teyler Specimen</i>) was discovered in 1855 near <!--del_lnk--> Riedenburg, Germany, and described as a <i><!--del_lnk--> Pterodactylus crassipes</i> in 1857 by von Meyer. It was reclassified in 1970 by <!--del_lnk--> John Ostrom and is currently located at the <!--del_lnk--> Teylers Museum in <!--del_lnk--> Haarlem, <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. It was the very first specimen, despite the classification error. It is also one of the least complete specimens, consisting mostly of limb bones and isolated cervical vertebrae and ribs.</p>
       <p>The <b>Eichst&auml;tt Specimen</b> (JM 2257) was discovered in 1951 near Workerszell, Germany and described by <!--del_lnk--> Peter Wellnhofer in 1974. Currently located at the <!--del_lnk--> Jura Museum in <!--del_lnk--> Eichst&auml;tt, Germany, it is the smallest specimen and has the second best head. It is possibly a separate genus (<i>Jurapteryx recurva</i>) or species (<i>A. recurva</i>).</p>
       <p>The <b>Solnhofen Specimen</b> (BSP 1999) was discovered in the 1970s near <!--del_lnk--> Eichst&auml;tt, Germany, and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the <!--del_lnk--> B&uuml;rgermeister-M&uuml;ller-Museum in Solnhofen, it was originally classified as <i><a href="../../wp/c/Compsognathus.htm" title="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a></i> by an amateur collector, the same burgomaster Friedrich M&uuml;ller after which the museum is named. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species, <i><!--del_lnk--> Wellnhoferia grandis</i>. It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.</p>
       <p>The <b>Munich Specimen</b> (S6, formerly known as the <i>Solnhofen-Aktien-Verein Specimen</i>) was discovered on 3 August 1992 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. It is currently located at the <!--del_lnk--> Pal&auml;ontologisches Museum M&uuml;nchen in <a href="../../wp/m/Munich.htm" title="Munich">Munich</a>, to which it was sold in 1999 for 1.9 million <!--del_lnk--> Deutschmark. What was initially believed to be a bony <!--del_lnk--> sternum turned out to be part of the <!--del_lnk--> coracoid, but a <!--del_lnk--> cartilaginous sternum may have been present. Only the front of its face is missing. It may be a new species, <i>A. bavarica</i>.</p>

       </div>
       <p>An eighth, fragmentary specimen was discovered in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at <!--del_lnk--> Daiting, Suevia. It is therefore known as the <b>Daiting Specimen</b>, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the <i>Naturkundemuseum</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Bamberg. Long remaining hidden and therefore dubbed the 'Phantom', the original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsd&ouml;rfer in 2009. It was on display for the first time with six other original fossils of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> at the <i>Munich Mineral Show</i> in October 2009. A first, quick look by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. It was found in a limestone bed that was a few hundred thousand years younger than the other finds.</p>

       <p>Another fragmentary fossil was found in 2000. It is in private possession and since 2004 on loan to the B&uuml;rgermeister-M&uuml;ller Museum in Solenhofen, so it is called the <b>B&uuml;rgermeister-M&uuml;ller Specimen</b>; the institute itself officially refers to it as the "Exemplar of the families Ottman &amp; Steil, Solnhofen". As the fragment represents the remains of a single wing of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, the popular name of this fossil is "chicken wing".</p>
       <p>Long in a private collection in Switzerland, the <b>Thermopolis Specimen</b> (WDC CSG 100) was discovered in Bavaria and described in 2005 by Mayr, Pohl, and Peters. Donated to the <!--del_lnk--> Wyoming Dinosaur Centre in <!--del_lnk--> Thermopolis, Wyoming, it has the best-preserved head and feet; most of the neck and the lower jaw have not been preserved. The "Thermopolis" specimen was described in the December 2, 2005 <i>Science</i> journal article as "A well-preserved <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimen with theropod features"; it shows that the <i>Archaeopteryx</i> lacked a reversed toe &mdash; a universal feature of birds &mdash; limiting its ability to perch on branches and implying a terrestrial or trunk-climbing lifestyle. This has been interpreted as evidence of <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">theropod</a> ancestry. In 1988, <!--del_lnk--> Gregory S. Paul claimed to have found evidence of a hyperextensible second toe, but this was not verified and accepted by other scientists until the Thermopolis specimen was described. "Until now, the feature was thought to belong only to the species' close relatives, the deinonychosaurs."</p>
       <p>The Thermopolis Specimen was assigned to <i>Archaeopteryx siemensii</i> in 2007. The specimen itself, currently on loan to the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Tyrrell Museum, <!--del_lnk--> Drumheller, <!--del_lnk--> Alberta, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, is considered the most complete and well preserved <i>Archaeopteryx</i> remains yet.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In 2011 the discovery of an eleventh specimen was announced. It is said to be one of the more complete specimens, but is missing the skull and one forelimb. It is privately owned and has yet to be given a name or described scientifically.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h3>
       <p>Today, the fossils are usually assigned to a single species <i>A. lithographica</i>, but the taxonomic history is complicated. Dozens of names have been published for the handful of specimens, most of which are simply spelling errors (<i>lapsus</i>). As interpreted today, the name <i>A. lithographica</i> only referred to the single feather described by <!--del_lnk--> von Meyer. In 1954 however, <!--del_lnk--> Gavin de Beer concluded that the London specimen was the <!--del_lnk--> holotype. In 1960, Swinton accordingly proposed that the name <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i> be placed on the official genera list making the alternative names <i>Griphosaurus</i> and <i>Griphornis</i> invalid. The ICZN, implicitly accepting de Beer's standpoint, did indeed suppress the plethora of alternative names initially proposed for the first skeleton specimens, which mainly resulted from the acrimonious dispute between von Meyer and his opponent <!--del_lnk--> Johann Andreas Wagner (whose <i>Griphosaurus problematicus</i> &mdash; "problematic <!--del_lnk--> riddle-lizard" &mdash; was a vitriolic sneer at von Meyer's <i>Archaeopteryx</i>). In addition, in 1977 the first specific name of the Haarlem specimen, <i>crassipes</i>, described by von Meyer as a <a href="../../wp/p/Pterosaur.htm" title="Pterosaur">pterosaur</a> before its true nature was realized, was also suppressed.</p>
       <div class="thumb tright">

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The relationships of the specimens are problematic. Most subsequent specimens have been given their own species at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as <i>Archaeornis siemensii</i>, the Eichst&auml;tt specimen as <i>Jurapteryx recurva</i>, the Munich specimen as <i>Archaeopteryx bavarica</i> and the Solnhofen specimen was designated as <i>Wellnhoferia grandis</i>.</p>
       <p>Recently, it has been argued that all the specimens belong to the same species. However, significant differences exist among the specimens. In particular, the Munich, Eichst&auml;tt, Solnhofen and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts, lined with forward-pointing teeth and possible presence of a sternum. These differences are as large as or larger than the differences seen today between adults of different bird species. However, it is also possible that these differences could be explained by different ages of the living birds.</p>
       <p>Finally, it has been noted that the feather, the first specimen of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> described, does not agree well with the flight-related feathers of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. It certainly is a <!--del_lnk--> flight feather of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of <!--del_lnk--> feathered theropod, of which only this feather is so far known. As the feather was in the early 21st century seen as the <!--del_lnk--> type specimen, this would have created significant <!--del_lnk--> nomenclatorial confusion because the name <i>Archaeopteryx</i> should then no longer be applied to the skeletons. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the <!--del_lnk--> ICZN requesting that the London specimen be explicitly made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or <!--del_lnk--> neotype. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on October 3, 2011.</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Controversy">Controversy</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Authenticity">Authenticity</span></h3>
       <p>Beginning in 1985, a group including <!--del_lnk--> astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Fred Hoyle and <!--del_lnk--> physicist <!--del_lnk--> Lee Spetner published a series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> were forged. Their claims were repudiated by <!--del_lnk--> Alan J. Charig and others at the <!--del_lnk--> British Museum (Natural History). Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of <!--del_lnk--> lithification; for example, they proposed that based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of <!--del_lnk--> cement, without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference. They also expressed disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly, or that one half of a slab containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the <!--del_lnk--> counterslab. These, though, are common properties of Solnhofen fossils because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along, leaving the bulk of the fossil on one side and little on the other. They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather, when this is visibly not the case. In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> known at the time did not have feathers, which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichst&auml;tt specimens have obvious feathers. Finally, the motives they suggested for a forgery are not strong, and contradictory; one is that <!--del_lnk--> Richard Owen wanted to forge evidence in support of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s theory of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen himself wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.</p>
       <p>Charig <i>et al.</i> pointed to the presence of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner <i>et al.</i> then attempted to show that the cracks would have naturally propagated through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account for the fact that the cracks were old and had been filled with <a href="../../wp/c/Calcite.htm" title="Calcite">calcite</a>, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through <!--del_lnk--> X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock. However, it was not cement, either, and is most probably from a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when molds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig <i>et al.</i> reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone &ndash; however, they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree &ndash; the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Archaeopteryx_and_Protoavis"><i>Archaeopteryx</i> and <i>Protoavis</i></span></h3>
       <p>In 1984, <!--del_lnk--> Sankar Chatterjee discovered fossils which he claimed in 1991 belonged to a fossil bird far older than <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. These fossils, believed to be around 210 to 225 million years old, have been assigned the name <i><!--del_lnk--> Protoavis</i>. The fossils are too badly preserved to allow an estimate of flying ability; although Chatterjee's reconstructions usually show feathers, many paleontologists, including Paul (2002) and Witmer (2002) have rejected the claims that <i>Protoavis</i> was an earlier bird (or, alternatively, that it existed at all). The fossils were found disarticulated, and were collected from different locations. Because the fossils are in poor condition, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> remains the earliest universally recognized bird.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Modern paleontology has consistently placed <i>Archaeopteryx</i> as the most primitive bird. It is not thought to be a true ancestor of modern birds but, rather, a close relative of that ancestor (see <!--del_lnk--> Avialae and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Aves">Aves</a>). Nonetheless, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird . Several authors have done so. Lowe (1935) and Thulborn (1984) questioned whether <i>Archaeopteryx</i> truly was the first bird. They suggested that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that <i><!--del_lnk--> Avimimus</i> was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. Barsbold (1983) and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997) noted that many <!--del_lnk--> maniraptoran lineages are extremely birdlike, and suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors. The discovery of the closely related <i><!--del_lnk--> Xiaotingia</i> in 2011 led to new phylogenetic analyses which suggested that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is a <!--del_lnk--> deinonychosaur rather than an avialan, and therefore not actually a "bird" under most common uses of that term. A more thorough analysis was published soon after to test this hypothesis, and failed to arrive at the same result; it found <i>Archaeopteryx</i> to be a bird in its traditional position at the base of Avialae, while <i>Xiaotingia</i> was recovered as a basal deinonychosaur, or troodontid. The authors of the follow-up study noted that uncertainties still exist, however, and that it may not be possible to confidently state whether or not <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is a member of Avialae or not barring new and better specimens of relevant species. Phylogenetic studies conducted by Senter <i>et al.</i> (2012) and Turner, Makovicky and Norell (2012) confirmed that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was more closely related to living birds than to dromaeosaurids and troodontids. On the other hand, Godefroit <i>et al.</i> (2013) recovered <i>Archaeopteryx</i> as more closely related to dromaeosaurids and troodontids. The authors used a modified version of the matrix from the study describing <i>Xiaotingia</i>, adding <i><!--del_lnk--> Jinfengopteryx elegans</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Eosinopteryx brevipenna</i> to it, as well as adding four additional characters related to the development of the plumage. Unlike the analysis from the description of <i>Xiaotingia</i>, the analysis conducted by Godefroit <i>et al.</i> did not find <i>Archaeopteryx</i> to be particularly closely related to <i>Anchiornis</i> and <i>Xiaotingia</i>, which were recovered as basal troodontids instead.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Hoatzin (<i>Ophisthocomus hoazin</i>), <a href="../../wp/g/Guyana.htm" title="Guyana">Guyana</a>'s national bird, has been often called a modern analog to <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. Since <i>Archaeopteryx</i> had three functional claws on each wing, some earlier systematists speculated that the Hoatzin was descended from it, because nestling Hoatzins have two functional claws on each wing. However, modern workers believe that the young Hoatzin's claws are of more recent origin, and may be a secondary adaptation resulting from its frequent need to leave the nest and climb about in dense vines and trees well before it is capable of flight.</p>

       <p><i>Archaeopteryx</i> has long been considered the earliest known bird; it has thus received widespread attention. Its easily recognizable appearance, and the public's interest in dinosaurs, have made <i>Archaeopteryx</i> a feature of worldwide popular culture.</p>
