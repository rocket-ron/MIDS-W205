The most common etymology links the city name to <i>al-Jaz&#x101;'ir</i> (&#x627;&#x644;&#x62C;&#x632;&#x627;&#x626;&#x631;, "The Islands"), a truncated form of the city's older name <i>Jaz&#x101;'ir Ban&#x12B; Mazghanna</i> (&#x62C;&#x632;&#x627;&#x626;&#x631; &#x628;&#x646;&#x64A; &#x645;&#x632;&#x63A;&#x646;&#x629;, "Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe"), employed by medieval geographers such as <!--del_lnk--> al-Idrisi. Others trace it to <i>Ldzayer</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> Maghrebi Arabic and <a href="../../wp/b/Berber_languages.htm" title="Berber languages">Berber</a> for "Algeria" possibly related to the <!--del_lnk--> Zirid Dynasty King <!--del_lnk--> Ziri ibn-Manad and founder of the city of Algiers.</p>

       <p>At Ain Hanech region (<!--del_lnk--> Sa&iuml;da Province), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in North Africa were found. Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the <!--del_lnk--> Levalloisian and <!--del_lnk--> Mousterian styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the <!--del_lnk--> Levant.</p>
       <p>Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of <!--del_lnk--> Middle Paleolithic <!--del_lnk--> Flake tool techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called <!--del_lnk--> Aterian (after the archeological site of <!--del_lnk--> Bir el Ater, south of <!--del_lnk--> Annaba).</p>
       <p>The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called <!--del_lnk--> Iberomaurusian (located mainly in <a href="../../wp/o/Oran.htm" title="Oran">Oran</a> region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the <a href="../../wp/m/Maghreb.htm" title="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghrib between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the <!--del_lnk--> Tassili n'Ajjer paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period.</p>
       <p>The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called <a href="../../wp/b/Berber_people.htm" title="Berber people">Berbers</a>, who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.</p>

       <p>From their principal centre of power at Carthage, the <!--del_lnk--> Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a <!--del_lnk--> Phoenician presence existed at <!--del_lnk--> Tipasa, east of <!--del_lnk--> Cherchell, <!--del_lnk--> Hippo Regius (modern <!--del_lnk--> Annaba) and <!--del_lnk--> Rusicade (modern <!--del_lnk--> Skikda). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.</p>
       <p>As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.</p>

       <p>By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the <!--del_lnk--> Revolt of the Mercenaries, Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the <!--del_lnk--> First Punic War. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the <!--del_lnk--> Punic Wars.</p>
       <p>In 146 BC the city of <!--del_lnk--> Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in <!--del_lnk--> Numidia, behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay <!--del_lnk--> Mauretania, which extended across the <!--del_lnk--> Moulouya River in modern day <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the <!--del_lnk--> Almohads and <!--del_lnk--> Almoravids more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Massinissa in the 2nd century BC.</p>
       <p>After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Massinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>.</p>
       <p>For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. The Vandals of <!--del_lnk--> Geiseric moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia. They did not make any significant settlement on the land. The region was later recaptured by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Eastern Roman Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>, which ruled it until the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim Conquest in the 7th century.</p>

       <p>When Muslim <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arab_people.htm" title="Arabs">Arabs</a> arrived in Algeria in the mid-7th century, a large number of locals converted to the new faith. After the fall of the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad Arab Dynasty in 751, numerous local Berber dynasties emerged. Amongst those dynasties were the <!--del_lnk--> Aghlabids, <!--del_lnk--> Almohads, <!--del_lnk--> Abdalwadid, <!--del_lnk--> Zirids, <!--del_lnk--> Rustamids, <!--del_lnk--> Hammadids, <!--del_lnk--> Almoravids and the <!--del_lnk--> Fatimids. converted the Berber <!--del_lnk--> Kutama of the <!--del_lnk--> Petite Kabylie to its cause, the <!--del_lnk--> Shia <!--del_lnk--> Fatimids overthrew the <!--del_lnk--> Rustamids, and conquered Egypt, leaving Algeria and Tunisia to their <!--del_lnk--> Zirid vassals. When the latter rebelled, the Shia Fatimids sent in the <!--del_lnk--> Banu Hilal and <!--del_lnk--> Banu Sulaym Arabian tribes who unexpectedly defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Zirids.</p>
       <p>The Berber people controlled much of the <a href="../../wp/m/Maghreb.htm" title="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> region throughout the Middle Ages. The Berbers were made up of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barn&egrave;s tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, <!--del_lnk--> Sanhadja, Houaras, <!--del_lnk--> Zenata, <!--del_lnk--> Masmouda, Kutama, Awarba, and <!--del_lnk--> Berghwata). All these tribes were independent and made territorial decisions.</p>
       <p>Several Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in Maghreb, Sudan, Andalusia, Sicily, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Egypt, and other nearby lands. <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Khaldun provides a table summarizing the Zirid, <!--del_lnk--> Banu Ifran, <!--del_lnk--> Maghrawa, <!--del_lnk--> Almoravid, <!--del_lnk--> Hammadid, <!--del_lnk--> Almohad, <!--del_lnk--> Merinid, Abdalwadid, <!--del_lnk--> Wattasid, <!--del_lnk--> Meknassa and <!--del_lnk--> Hafsid dynasties.</p>
       <p>In the early 16th century, Spain constructed fortified outposts (<!--del_lnk--> presidios) on or near the Algerian coast. Spain took control of <!--del_lnk--> Mers el Kebir in 1505; <a href="../../wp/o/Oran.htm" title="Oran">Oran</a> in 1509; and <!--del_lnk--> Tlemcen, <!--del_lnk--> Mostaganem, and <!--del_lnk--> T&eacute;n&egrave;s, in 1510. In the same year, the merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbour to Spain, which built a fort on it. The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spain's merchant fleet.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In 1516 the Muslim privateer brothers <!--del_lnk--> Aruj and <!--del_lnk--> Hayreddin Barbarossa, who operated successfully under the <!--del_lnk--> Hafsids, moved their base of operations to Algiers. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of <!--del_lnk--> Tlemcen, Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> sultan gave him the title of <!--del_lnk--> beylerbey and a contingent of some 2,000 <!--del_lnk--> janissaries. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin subdued the coastal region between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791).</p>
       <p>The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son <!--del_lnk--> Hasan, who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an <!--del_lnk--> agha. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Plague had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620&ndash;21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654&ndash;57, 1665, 1691, and 1740&ndash;42.</p>
       <p>In 1671, the <!--del_lnk--> taifa rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of <!--del_lnk--> dey. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the <!--del_lnk--> divan, a council of some sixty notables. It was at first dominated by the <i><!--del_lnk--> ojaq</i>; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent, replacing the <!--del_lnk--> pasha in that role. Although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there.</p>
       <p>The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671-1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups, and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the <!--del_lnk--> Kabylie.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea. The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slaves</a>. They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives. According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves. They often made raids, called <!--del_lnk--> Razzias, on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at <!--del_lnk--> slave markets in North Africa and the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.</p>
       <p>In 1544, Hayreddin captured the island of <!--del_lnk--> Ischia, taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of <!--del_lnk--> Lipari, almost the entire population. In 1551, <!--del_lnk--> Turgut Reis enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of <!--del_lnk--> Gozo, between 5,000 and 6,000, sending the captives to Libya. In 1554, pirates sacked <!--del_lnk--> Vieste in southern Italy and took an estimated 7,000 captives as slaves.</p>
       <p>In 1558, Barbary corsairs captured the town of <!--del_lnk--> Ciutadella (Minorca), destroyed it, slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3,000 survivors as slaves to <a href="../../wp/i/Istanbul.htm" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. Barbary pirates often attacked the <!--del_lnk--> Balearic Islands, and in response, the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churchesd. The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of <!--del_lnk--> Formentera.</p>
       <p>Between 1609 to 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates. In the 19th century, the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a "license tax" in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels. One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved 130 American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from 1785 to 1793.</p>
       <p>Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the <!--del_lnk--> First (1801&ndash;1805) and <!--del_lnk--> Second Barbary Wars (1815). Following those wars, Algeria was weaker, and Europeans, with an Anglo-Dutch fleet commanded by the British <!--del_lnk--> Lord Exmouth, <!--del_lnk--> attacked Algiers. After a nine-hour bombardment, they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by <!--del_lnk--> Decatur (US navy) concerning the demands of tributes. In addition, the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving Christians.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830. The conquest of Algeria by the French was long and resulted in considerable bloodshed. A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872. The population of Algeria, which stood at about 1.5 million in 1830, reached nearly 11 million in 1960. French policy was predicated on "civilizing" the country, although its literacy rate of 50% in 1830, according to some Algerian historians, exceeded that of France. Algeria's social fabric suffered during the occupation: literacy plummeted. During this period, a small but influential French-speaking <!--del_lnk--> indigenous elite was formed, made up of Berbers mostly from <!--del_lnk--> Kabyles.</p>
       <p>In the French policy of "divide to reign," its government favored the Kabyles. About 80% of Indigenous Schools were constructed for Kabyles.</p>
       <p>From 1848 until independence, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and d&eacute;partement of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of <!--del_lnk--> European immigrants, who became known as <i>colons</i> and later, as <i><!--del_lnk--> pieds-noirs.</i> Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria. These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.</p>
       <p>Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence, from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the <!--del_lnk--> Algerian War began. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 <!--del_lnk--> Harkis and their dependents were killed by the <!--del_lnk--> Front de Lib&eacute;ration Nationale (FLN) or by <!--del_lnk--> lynch mobs in Algeria. The FLN used terrorist attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted severe reprisals and repression. The war concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 <!--del_lnk--> Evian agreements and the July 1962 <!--del_lnk--> self-determination referendum.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Algeria's first president was the FLN leader <!--del_lnk--> Ahmed Ben Bella. Morocco's claim to <!--del_lnk--> portions of western Algeria led to the <!--del_lnk--> Sand War in 1963. Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by <!--del_lnk--> Houari Boum&eacute;dienne, his former ally and defense minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and <!--del_lnk--> authoritarian; Boum&eacute;dienne continued this trend. But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He <a href="../../wp/c/Collective_farming.htm" title="Collective farming">collectivised</a> agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive. <!--del_lnk--> Oil extraction facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international <a href="../../wp/1/1973_oil_crisis.htm" title="1973 oil crisis">1973 oil crisis</a>.</p>
       <p>In the 1960s and 70s under President <!--del_lnk--> Houari Boumediene, Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a state-controlled socialist economy. Boumediene&rsquo;s successor, <!--del_lnk--> Chadli Bendjedid, introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of <!--del_lnk--> Arabisation in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread radical Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political Islamism.</p>
       <p>The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s oil glut. Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Front Islamique du Salut (FIS), a broad coalition of Islamist groups.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Civil_War_and_aftermath">Civil War and aftermath</span></h3>
       <p>In December 1991 the <!--del_lnk--> Front Islamique du Salut dominated the first of two rounds of <!--del_lnk--> legislative elections. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a <!--del_lnk--> High Council of State was installed to act as Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil <!--del_lnk--> insurgency between its armed wing, the <!--del_lnk--> Armed Islamic Group, and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 persons are thought to have died. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.</p>
       <p>Algeria held <!--del_lnk--> elections in 1999, which were won by President <!--del_lnk--> Abdelaziz Bouteflika. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a &lsquo;Civil Concord&rsquo; initiative, approved in a <!--del_lnk--> referendum, under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The <!--del_lnk--> Groupe Salafiste pour la Pr&eacute;dication et le Combat (GSPC), a splinter group of the Group Islamic Arm&eacute;e, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.</p>
       <p>Bouteflika was re-elected in the <!--del_lnk--> April 2004 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the <!--del_lnk--> Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation, which was approved in a <!--del_lnk--> referendum in September 2005. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.</p>
       <p>In November 2008, the <!--del_lnk--> Algerian Constitution was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 presidential elections, and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.</p>
       <p>A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar <!--del_lnk--> protests across the Middle East and North Africa. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old <!--del_lnk--> state of emergency. The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies. In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform.</p>

       <p>Algeria is the largest country in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Arab world, and the <!--del_lnk--> Mediterranean Basin. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the <a href="../../wp/s/Sahara.htm" title="Sahara">Sahara</a>. To the north, the <!--del_lnk--> Tell Atlas form with the <!--del_lnk--> Saharan Atlas, further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of <!--del_lnk--> Aures and <!--del_lnk--> Nememcha occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is <!--del_lnk--> Mount Tahat (3,003 m).</p>
       <p>Algeria lies mostly between latitudes <!--del_lnk--> 19&deg; and <!--del_lnk--> 37&deg;N (a small area is north of 37&deg;), and longitudes <!--del_lnk--> 9&deg;W and <!--del_lnk--> 12&deg;E. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural <!--del_lnk--> harbours. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a <!--del_lnk--> steppe landscape ending with the <!--del_lnk--> Saharan Atlas; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ahaggar Mountains (<a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">&#x62C;&#x628;&#x627;&#x644; &#x647;&#x642;&#x627;&#x631;</span>&lrm;), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about 1,500&nbsp;km (932&nbsp;mi) south of the capital, Algiers, and just west of <!--del_lnk--> Tamanghasset. Algiers, <a href="../../wp/o/Oran.htm" title="Oran">Oran</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Constantine, <!--del_lnk--> Tizi Ouzou and <!--del_lnk--> Annaba are Algeria's main cities.</p>

       <p>In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.</p>
       <p>The highest official temperature was <span style="white-space:nowrap;">50.6 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(123.1&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> at In Salah.</p>
       <p>Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from 400 to 670 mm (15.7 to 26.4 in) annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. <!--del_lnk--> Precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as 1,000&nbsp;mm (39.4&nbsp;in) in some years.</p>
       <p>Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. <!--del_lnk--> Prevailing winds that are easterly and north-easterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from September through December, a decrease in the late winter and spring months, and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months. Algeria also has <!--del_lnk--> ergs, or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">110 &deg;F</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(43.3&nbsp;&deg;C)</span>.</p>

       <p>Algeria is an <!--del_lnk--> authoritarian regime, according to the <!--del_lnk--> Democracy Index 2010. The <!--del_lnk--> Freedom of the Press 2009 report gives it rating "Not Free".</p>
       <p>Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria. Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military "d&eacute;cideurs", known as "le pouvoir" ("the power"), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man may be <!--del_lnk--> Mohamed Medi&egrave;ne, head of the military intelligence. In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired. After the death of General <!--del_lnk--> Larbi Belkheir, Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at <!--del_lnk--> Sonatrach, and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely.</p>
       <p>The head of state is the president of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms, but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation. Algeria has universal <!--del_lnk--> suffrage at 18 years of age. The President is the head of the <!--del_lnk--> army, the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Ministers the <!--del_lnk--> High Security Council. He appoints the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister who is also the head of government.</p>
       <p>The Algerian parliament is <!--del_lnk--> bicameral; the lower house, the <!--del_lnk--> People's National Assembly, has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms, while the upper house, the <!--del_lnk--> Council of the Nation, has 144 members serving six-year terms, of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president. According to the <!--del_lnk--> constitution, no political association may be formed if it is "based on differences in religion, language, race, gender, profession or region". In addition, political campaigns must be exempt from the aforementioned subjects.</p>
       <p>Parliamentary elections were last held in <!--del_lnk--> May 2012, and were judged to be largely free by international monitors, though local groups alleged fraud and irregularities. In the elections, the <!--del_lnk--> FLN won 221 seats, the military-backed <!--del_lnk--> National Rally for Democracy won 70, and the Islamist <!--del_lnk--> Green Algeria Alliance won 47.</p>

       <p>The military of Algeria consists of the <!--del_lnk--> People's National Army (ANP), the <!--del_lnk--> Algerian National Navy (MRA), and the <!--del_lnk--> Algerian Air Force (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defense Force. It is the direct successor of the <!--del_lnk--> Arm&eacute;e de Lib&eacute;ration Nationale (ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front which fought French colonial <!--del_lnk--> occupation during the Algerian War of Independence (1954&ndash;62).</p>
       <p>Total military personnel include 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate). Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19&ndash;30, for a total of 18 months (six training and 12 in civil projects). The total military expenditure in 2006 was estimated variously at 2.7% of GDP (3,096&nbsp;million), or 3.3% of GDP.</p>
       <p>In 2007, the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase 49 <!--del_lnk--> MiG-29SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated cost of $1.9&nbsp;billion.

       <p>Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Bank_Group.htm" title="World Bank Group">World Bank</a>. The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model. In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.</p>
       <p>Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages. The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.</p>
       <p>A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian Government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past five years. The 2010-14 public-investment programme will cost US$ 286 billion, 40% of which will go to human development.</p>
       <p>The Algerian economy grew by 2.6% in 2011, driven by public spending, in particular in the construction and public-works sector, and by growing internal demand. If hydrocarbons are excluded, growth has been estimated at 4.8%. Growth of 3.1% is expected in 2012, rising to 4.2% in 2013. The rate of inflation was 3.9% and the budget deficit 3% of GDP. The current-account surplus is estimated at 9.3% of GDP and at the end of December 2011, official reserves were put at US$ 182.2 billion. Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4% on average between 2003 and 2007.</p>
       <p>In 2011 Algeria announced a budgetary surplus of $26.93 billion, 62.46% increase in comparison to 2010 surplus. In general, the country exported $73.39 billion worth of commodities while it imported $46.45 billion.</p>
       <p>Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in <!--del_lnk--> foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's <!--del_lnk--> external debt is extremely low at about 2% of GDP. The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria&rsquo;s budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.</p>
       <p>In 2011, the agricultural sector and services recorded growth of 10% and 5.3%, respectively. About 14% of the labor force are employed in the <!--del_lnk--> agricultural sector. Fiscal policy in 2011 remained expansionist and made it possible to maintain the pace of public investment and to contain the strong demand for jobs and housing.</p>
       <p>Algeria has not joined the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/World_Trade_Organization.htm" title="WTO">WTO</a>, despite several years of negotiations.</p>
       <p>In March 2006, Russia agreed to erase $4.74&nbsp;billion of Algeria's <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a>-era debt during a visit by <!--del_lnk--> Russian President <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Putin.htm" title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, <!--del_lnk--> Algerian President <!--del_lnk--> Abdelaziz Bouteflika agreed to buy $7.5&nbsp;billion worth of combat planes, air-defense systems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russia's state arms exporter <!--del_lnk--> Rosoboronexport.</p>

       <p>Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an <!--del_lnk--> OPEC member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the <!--del_lnk--> 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the <!--del_lnk--> sixth-largest gas exporter. The U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Energy Information Administration reported that in 2005, Algeria had 160 trillion cubic feet (4.5<span style="margin-left:0.2em">&times;<span style="margin-left:0.1em">10</span></span><s style="display:none">^</s><sup>12</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of proven <!--del_lnk--> natural-gas reserves. It also ranks <!--del_lnk--> 16th in oil reserves.</p>
       <p>Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.</p>
       <p>Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards. Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011. Nevertheless, the sector accounted for 98% of the total volume of exports in 2011 and 70% of budgetary receipts, or USD 71.4 billion.</p>
       <p>The Algerian national oil company is <!--del_lnk--> Sonatrach, which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria. All foreign operators must work in partnership with Sonatrach, which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Labour_market">Labour market</span></h3>
       <p>Despite a decline in total unemployment, youth and women unemployment is high. Unemployment particularly affects the young, with a jobless rate of 21.5% among the 15-24 age group.</p>
       <p>The overall rate of unemployment was 10% in 2011, but remained higher among young people, with a rate of 21.5% for those aged between 15 and 24. The government strengthened in 2011 the job programmes introduced in 1988, in particular in the framework of the programme to aid those seeking work (Dispositif d&rsquo;Aide &agrave; l&rsquo;Insertion Professionnelle).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tourism">Tourism</span></h3>
       <p>The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.</p>

It is a 3-way 1 216&nbsp;km, linking the city of <!--del_lnk--> Annaba in the extreme east to the city of <!--del_lnk--> Tlemcen in the far West. Algeria is also crossed by the <!--del_lnk--> Trans-Sahara Highway, which is now totally paved.

       <p>As of a January 2010 estimate, Algeria's population was 34.9&nbsp;million, who are mainly <!--del_lnk--> Arab-Berber ethnically. At the outset of the 20th century, its population was approximately four million. About 90% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the inhabitants of the Sahara desert are mainly concentrated in <!--del_lnk--> oases, although some 1.5&nbsp;million remain <!--del_lnk--> nomadic or partly nomadic. More than 25% of Algerians are under the age of 15.</p>
       <p>Women make up 70% of the country's lawyers and 60% of its judges, and also dominate the field of medicine. Increasingly, women are contributing more to household income than men. Sixty percent of university students are women, according to university researchers.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> USCRI estimates that 95,700 <!--del_lnk--> refugees and <!--del_lnk--> asylum-seekers have sought refuge in Algeria. This includes roughly 90,000 from Western Sahara and 4,100 from <!--del_lnk--> Palestine.

       <p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Berber_people.htm" title="Berbers">Berbers</a> are the indigenous ethnic group of Algeria and are believed to be the ancestral stock on which elements from the <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicians, <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Byzantines, <a href="../../wp/a/Arab_people.htm" title="Arab people">Arabs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Turks as well as other ethnic groups have contributed to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Ethnic_group.htm" title="Ethnic">ethnic</a> makeup of Algeria. Descendants of <!--del_lnk--> Andalusian refugees are also present in the population of Algiers and other cities.</p>
       <p>The overwhelming majority of Algerians are <a href="../../wp/b/Berber_people.htm" title="Berber people">Berbers</a> in origins, but a majority identifies with an Arabic-based culture. Berbers are divided into many groups with varying languages. The largest of these are the Kabyles, who live in the <!--del_lnk--> Kabylie region east of Algiers, the Chaoui of North-East Algeria, the Tuaregs in the southern desert and the <!--del_lnk--> Shenwa people of North Algeria.</p>
       <p>There is also a minority of about 600,000 to 2 million <!--del_lnk--> Algerian Turks, descendants of Turks who came to the region during the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> rule in North Africa. Today's <!--del_lnk--> Turkish descendants are often called <i><!--del_lnk--> Kouloughlis,</i> meaning descendants of Turkish men and native Algerian women.</p>
       <p>During the colonial period, there was a large (15.2% in 1962) European population who became known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Pieds-Noirs.</i> They were primarily of <!--del_lnk--> French origin, but there were also <!--del_lnk--> Spanish colonists in the west of the country, <!--del_lnk--> Italians and <!--del_lnk--> Maltese in the east, and other Europeans such as <!--del_lnk--> Greeks in smaller numbers. Almost all of this population left during the war of independence or immediately after its end.</p>

       <p>Although <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> has no official status, Algeria is the second largest Francophone country in the world in terms of speakers and French is still widely used in the government, the culture, the media (newspapers) and the education system (since primary school) due to <!--del_lnk--> Algeria's colonial history. It can be regarded as being the <i>de facto</i> co-official language of Algeria. In 2008, 11.2 million Algerians could read and write in French.</p>
       <p>Algeria emerged as a bilingual state after 1962. Colloquial <!--del_lnk--> Algerian Arabic is spoken by about 72% of the population and Berber by 27-30%.</p>

       <p>Contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Algerian cinema is various in terms of genre, exploring a wider range of themes and issues. There has been a transition from cinema which focused on the war of independence to films more concerned with the everyday lives of Algerians.</p>

Other new artistic currents including the one of <!--del_lnk--> M'hamed Issiakhem, <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Khadda and Bachir Yelles, appeared on the scene of Algerian painting, abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways, in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations. <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Khadda and <!--del_lnk--> M'hamed Issiakhem have been notable in recent years.</p>

       <p>As a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the <i>Algerian trilogy</i> of <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Dib, or even <i>Nedjma</i> of <!--del_lnk--> Kateb Yacine novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work.

       <p>Since the 1970s, in a centralized system that was designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy, the Algerian Government introduced a decree by which the school became compulsory for all children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence, now the literacy rate is around 78.7%.</p>
       <p>Since 1972, Arabic is used as the language of instruction during the first nine years of schooling. From the third year, French is taught and it is also the language of instruction for science classes. The students can also learn <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Italian_language.htm" title="Italian language">Italian</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>. In 2008, new programs at the elementary appeared, therefore the compulsory schooling does not start at the age of six anymore, but at the age of five. Apart from the 122 private, learning at school, the Universities of the State are free of charge. After nine years of primary school, students can go to the high school or to an educational institution. The school offers two programs: general or technical. At the end of the third year of secondary school, students pass the exam of the Bachelor's degree, which allows once it is successful to pursue graduate studies in universities and institutes.</p>
       <p>Education is officially compulsory for children between the ages of six and 15. In 2008, the illiteracy rate for people over 10 was 22.3%, 15.6% for men and 29.0% for women. The province with the lowest rate of illiteracy was <!--del_lnk--> Algiers Province at 11.6%, while the province with the highest rate was <!--del_lnk--> Djelfa Province at 35.5%.</p>
       <p>Algeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education, which must accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008. The University of Algiers, founded in 1879, is the oldest, it offers education in various disciplines (law, medicine, science and letters). 25 of these universities and almost all of the institutions of higher education were founded after the independence of the country.</p>
       <p>Even if some of them offer instruction in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> like areas of law and the economy, most of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English. Among the most important universities, there are the University of sciences and technology Houari Boumediene, the University of Mentouri Constantine, Oran Es-Senia University. Best universities of qualifications remain the University of Tlemcen and Batna Hadj Bereket, they occupy the 26th and 45th row in Africa, which is a very bad standing.</p>
