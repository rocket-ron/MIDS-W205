The principal <!--del_lnk--> port of <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, Aarhus is on the east side of the peninsula of <!--del_lnk--> Jutland in the geographical centre of Denmark. Aarhus is the seat of the council of <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus municipality with 319,094 inhabitants and 252,213 (1 January 2013) in the inner urban area. According to Aarhus municipality, the "Greater Aarhus" area has a population of about 1.25 million people. The city claims the unofficial title "Capital of Jutland".</p>
       <p>Aarhus is the main and biggest city in the <!--del_lnk--> East Jutland metropolitan area (<!--del_lnk--> Danish: <span lang="da" xml:lang="da"><i>Byregion &Oslash;stjylland</i></span>), which is a co-operation in eastern <!--del_lnk--> Jutland with 17 municipalities. With more than 1.2 million people living in the East Jutland metropolitan area it represents approximately 23% of the population of Denmark.

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The city was mentioned for the first time by <!--del_lnk--> Adam of Bremen who stated that "Reginbrand, bishop of the church of Aarhus (Harusa)" participated in a church meeting in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Ingelheim in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>.</p>
       <p>During the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> the city was called <i>Arus</i>, and in Icelandic chronicles, it was known as <i>&Aacute;r&oacute;ss</i>. It is a compound of the two words <i>&#x101;r</i>, genitive of <i>&#x101;</i> ("river", Modern Danish <i>&aring;</i>) and <i>&#x14D;ss</i> ("mouth", Modern Danish <i>munding</i>; in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for "river delta"). The name originates from the city's location around the mouth of the stream <i>Aarhus &Aring;</i> (English: <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus River), <i>&Aring;</i> being the Danish word for a small river.</p>
       <p>Through regular sound development, Medieval Danish <i>Arus</i> became <i>Aars</i> or <i>Oes</i>, a form which persisted in the dialects of the surrounding parishes until the 20th century. In 1406, <i>Aarhus</i> became prevalent in the written sources, and gradually became the norm in the 17th century. <i>Aarhus</i> is probably a remodelling after the numerous Low German place names in <i>-husen</i>, possibly as a result of the influence of German merchants.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aarhus.2F.C3.85rhus_spelling">Aarhus/&Aring;rhus spelling</span></h3>
       <p>With the <!--del_lnk--> Danish spelling reform of 1948 <i>Aa</i> was changed to <i>&Aring;</i>. Some Danish cities resisted the new spelling of their names, notably <!--del_lnk--> Aalborg and <!--del_lnk--> Aabenraa. Contrarily, &Aring;rhus city council explicitly embraced the new spelling, thought to enhance an image of progressiveness.</p>
       <p>In 2010, a majority of the city council voted for a name change from <i>&Aring;rhus</i> back to <i>Aarhus</i>, and the renaming came into effect on January 1, 2011. Mayor at that time <!--del_lnk--> Nicolai Wammen argued that the <i>Aa</i> spelling would strengthen the city's international profile, help private enterprise and make it easier to access Aarhus on the internet. The <i>Aarhus</i> spelling has, however, always had some use in non-Scandinavian languages. There is considerable opposition to the <i>Aa</i> spelling and according to a May 2011 poll 59.8% of the city's inhabitants preferred the <i>&Aring;</i> spelling.</p>
       <p>Although the name on many signs and other physical media still reads <i>&Aring;rhus</i>, official informational websites have effectively altered occurrences of <i>&Aring;rhus</i> to <i>Aarhus</i>. Furthermore, certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city. An example is the <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus River for which the Danish name has been altered from <i>&Aring;rhus &Aring;</i> to <i>Aarhus &Aring;</i>. However, in Danish it is always correct to write geographical names with the letter &Aring;, while local councils since 1984 have been allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative option. When a local authority decides so, most newspapers and state institutions will re-adopt the pre-1948 Aa spelling and the &Aring; spelling will in practice become second-place. However, the official authorities are the <!--del_lnk--> Danish Placename Commission and the <!--del_lnk--> Danish Language Committee, publisher of the <!--del_lnk--> Danish Orthographic Dictionary, which will keep <i>&Aring;rhus</i> as the main name and have <i>Aarhus</i> as a new, second option, in brackets.</p>

       <p>The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 951, and archaeological findings date back some 1,300 years to <!--del_lnk--> Viking times. The city itself is presumably older than 770 AD, making Aarhus the oldest big city in Scandinavia. The favorable central position of the city within Denmark afforded it trade from <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Baltic countries, the greater peninsula of <!--del_lnk--> Jutland and the communities on the many smaller islands in its vicinity, which meant that trade always had a great significance to the town &ndash; a significance which is still true today.</p>
       <p>The city did not expand outwards until the late 19th century, and <!--del_lnk--> Aalborg remained the largest city on the peninsula until the 1920s. The relatively fast, albeit late, growth of the city can be ascribed to the general tendencies of a population moving from rural to urban areas during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a>. Industrialisation meant that proximity to trade routes became more important, giving the harbour city some advantages over other nearby cities as new industries came into existence.</p>

       <p>The oldest <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">archaeological</a> findings in Aarhus are glass pearls, which date to the end of the 7th century. Half buried <!--del_lnk--> longhouses, used both as homes and workshops for the Vikings have also been found. In the houses and the adjoining archaeological layers, combs, jewelry and basic multi-purpose tools have been found that indicate the settlement is from approximately year 900. Digs in the spring of 2005 revealed a so-called city-ditch from the year 850 which might have marked the trade centre upon which the city is built.</p>
       <p>The finding of six <!--del_lnk--> runestones in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around year 1000 as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them. The centre of Aarhus was once a <!--del_lnk--> pagan burial site until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it during the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Frode, King of Jutland, around 900.</p>

       <p>During the wars of the 17th century, it is probable that the city suffered in a significant way. Fortifications still exist south of the city as a reminder of the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> imperial campaigns between 1627 and 1629. In 1644, <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> taxed the city harshly and between 1657 and 1659, it was occupied by Swedish troops on several occasions.</p>
       <p>In spite of these and other misfortunes, such as plague and city-wide fires, Aarhus was still quite a significant city in <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> due to its favourable geographical position which was of significant importance for trading. Trade came mainly from the inland of <!--del_lnk--> Jutland but also from <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>, <!--del_lnk--> L&uuml;beck, <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, England, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>. In the middle of the 18th century the trade fleet consisted of approximately 100 ships.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="19th_century">19th century</span></h3>
       <p>In the 19th century, the city gained more independence from the dominance of <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Hamburg.htm" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. While it had been the third largest city in Jutland during the early 19th century, its population surpassed <!--del_lnk--> Randers in 1840 and in 1850, <!--del_lnk--> Aalborg, thus becoming the largest city in Jutland and the second largest in Denmark.</p>
       <p>The city's material prosperity continued to increase as the harbour expanded and the railway network grew. Culturally, it marketed itself as the "Capital of Jutland" and expanded many of its cultural institutions like the national library, universities, the <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus Theatre and hospitals.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geography">Geography</span></h2>
       <p>The city lies roughly at the geographical centre of Denmark on the peninsula of <!--del_lnk--> Jutland. Forests reach from the south into the city to within a kilometre (0.6&nbsp;mi) of the city centre, because the city has grown around the forest, and some forest areas are completely surrounded by the city, such as <!--del_lnk--> Riis Skov. The city is built mostly around the harbour, which is predominantly industrial, although a large recreational marina is situated south of it as an extension.</p>

       <p>While some of the highest points in Denmark are close to the city, the general landscape is typically hilly, interspersed with forests and meadows; the city itself is very hilly north of the centre (by Danish standards, that is; see <!--del_lnk--> Highest hill, Denmark). The coastline consists mainly of sandy beaches, but stony areas are not uncommon. The immediate coastal regions are not heavily populated due to a national policy of keeping residences inland rather than crowding the coast.</p>
       <p>The city lies at the junction of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Railway">railway</a> lines from all parts of the country. To the south west (about 21&nbsp;km (13&nbsp;mi), by rail) lies a picturesque region that contains the <!--del_lnk--> Guden&aring;. Several larger lakes extend West from the <!--del_lnk--> Skanderborg railway junction and rise to heights exceeding 152 metres (499&nbsp;ft) at <!--del_lnk--> Himmelbjerget. The railway traverses this district of moorland and woodland to <!--del_lnk--> Silkeborg.</p>

       <p>More than 300,000 people live within the city limits of Aarhus, while an additional 500,000 live in the surrounding local area of the <!--del_lnk--> East Jutland region. Aarhus is also a major part of the larger <!--del_lnk--> East Jutland metropolitan area with 1,200,000 inhabitants, which makes East Jutland the second most-populated area in Denmark, after the <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> area.</p>
       <p>Of the population of Aarhus, 65,000 are under 18 years of age. Aarhus has been growing at a steady rate of about 1% per year since 1950, when the city had about 150,000 inhabitants. <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus University estimates an increase of around 20,000 more students in the next six years, with attendant concerns over a lack of housing. In response, the city council has already initiated a large range of building projects to house some 100,000 new citizens before 2030 so the city population will rise to almost 400,000 inhabitants.</p>
       <p>The population of Aarhus is both younger and better-educated than the national average. This is often attributed to the high concentration of educational institutions and facilities in the area.</p>
       <p>Nearly 12% of the population are immigrants, which is high for Denmark, but modest when compared to some other European cities. The largest immigrant groups (January 1, 2008) are Palestinians (4,644),Turks (4,089), Somalis (3,476), Iraqis (3,140), Vietnamese (2,382), and Iranians (2,199). These groups live mainly in the western parts of Aarhus, where the <!--del_lnk--> Gellerup area is infamous for its high concentration of immigrants (88%, 2006). The vast majority of the immigrants in Gellerup are <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arab_people.htm" title="Arabs">Arabs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Turks and <!--del_lnk--> Somalis. Other large immigrant groups in Aarhus include Germans (1,573), Poles (1,555), Norwegians (1,050), Afghans (958), and Britons (763).</p>

       </div>
       <p>The harbour is one of the largest industrial harbours in <!--del_lnk--> Northern Europe and the largest in Denmark. The facilities are very modern and handle approximately 12 million tonnes of cargo (2006) and are therefore among the 100 biggest containerports in the world. Much agricultural produce is exported, while <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> are among the chief imports. The harbour itself is maintained by <!--del_lnk--> &Aring;rhus Stevedore Kompagni A/S originally based in Aarhus but currently operating several harbours around the world.</p>
       <p>The region is a major producer of <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural products</a> with many large farms in the outlying districts. Cattle, pork and grain are the main products with a sizable related refinement industry present. Computer and technology heavy industries are mainly focused in the urban areas with an abundance of small and medium sized IT and service companies dotting the city centre.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ceres Brewery, part of <!--del_lnk--> Royal Unibrew, was originally founded in Aarhus. Royal Unibrew announced the closure of Ceres in 2008.</p>

       <p>Aarhus is a centre for education on the peninsula of <!--del_lnk--> Jutland. It draws students from a large area, especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities. There are many cafes and restaurants as well as discoth&egrave;ques, cinemas, museums, amusement parks, and various other entertainment venues . Each year, the town hosts several festivals and concerts, including <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus International Jazz Festival and <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus Festuge the biggest festival in Scandinavia. The <!--del_lnk--> Vestereng park facility is also a site for large popular-music concerts.</p>
       <p>One major tourist attraction in Aarhus is <!--del_lnk--> The Old Town (<!--del_lnk--> Danish: <span lang="da" xml:lang="da"><i>Den Gamle By</i></span>), which is not actually an old part of the city itself, but a collection of historic Danish buildings gathered from all around the country. The city also hosts the <!--del_lnk--> Tivoli Friheden amusement park as well as the <!--del_lnk--> deer park situated in the large nearby public forest.</p>

       <p>Architecturally impressive sights include the 13th century <!--del_lnk--> cathedral in the centre of the city; <!--del_lnk--> &Aring;rhus Domkirke is the tallest cathedral in Denmark, as well as the second longest in <!--del_lnk--> Northern Europe, being only 45&nbsp;cm (18&nbsp;in) shorter than its counterpart in <!--del_lnk--> Trondheim. The <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus City Hall is a uniquely designed building drawn by renowned architect <!--del_lnk--> Arne Jacobsen, located in the city centre. The city hall is included in the national educational canon for culture as an example of important architectural work.</p>
       <p>There are many museums scattered around the city with <!--del_lnk--> ARoS being the newest and largest featuring daily exhibits of contemporary art. Other museums include <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus Kunstbygning also featuring mostly contemporary art, <!--del_lnk--> Frihedsmuseet focusing on the occupation and resistance movement during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Kvindemuseet mainly showcasing feminist history and culture.</p>
       <p>Being a comparatively large Danish city, Aarhus has received a fair share of immigrants from various other cultures and is as such also home to one of the few <!--del_lnk--> ghettos in Denmark, <!--del_lnk--> Gellerup. The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute to many cultural flavours uncommon for the North, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> themed <!--del_lnk--> Bazar West, a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.</p>
       <p>The city has an active and visible gay and lesbian community which the city officially attempts to promote and nurture. The <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus Festuge festival usually includes several exhibits, concerts or events specifically designed for these communities. There are several clubs, discos and cafes aimed at gays and lesbians: Danish D-lite (sports), G bar (disco) or Gaia Vandreklub (hiking club) are a few examples.</p>
       <p>It is common for tourist brochures and local politicians to refer to the town with the tongue-in-cheek slogan "The world's smallest big city" reflecting the fact that the city has everything a city needs despite not being a metropolis like London. Another popular, and perhaps better known, phrase to describe the city is "City of Smiles" &ndash; a slogan first coined by the city council in the 1930s as an advertising slogan, and which subsequently is used widely in popular culture today.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Aarhus Airport is located 40&nbsp;km (25&nbsp;mi) north-east of Aarhus in <!--del_lnk--> Tirstrup, the bigger <!--del_lnk--> Billund Airport is situated 95&nbsp;km (59&nbsp;mi) south-west of Aarhus. There have been plans for constructing a new, bigger airport for a long time, but so far, the plans have not been realized.</p>
       <p>Aarhus is served by commuter rail that connects the city itself with neighbouring towns. The main station in Aarhus is <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus Central Station, which is located in the city centre. Most city bus lines go through the inner city and pass through either Park Alle or Baneg&aring;rdspladsen (lit. English: "Central Station Square") or both. County and Inter-city buses terminate at Aarhus Bus Terminal which is located 900 meters north-west of Baneg&aring;rdspladsen, and in front of the <!--del_lnk--> Radisson SAS Scandinavia hotel at Margrethepladsen. The long-distance busses of <i>linie888</i> connect Aarhus to other cities in Jutland and <!--del_lnk--> Zealand.</p>
       <p>The Danish ferry company <!--del_lnk--> Mols-Linien connects Aarhus with <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> (located on the isle of Zealand). The fastest ferries in the world (100&nbsp;km/h) operate up to 10 times daily from the port of Aarhus to the port city of <!--del_lnk--> Sj&aelig;llands Odde. The ferries transport both private vehicles and the line888 busses. The German based ferry company <!--del_lnk--> F&ouml;rde Reederei Seetouristik has since 2011 been a competitor with a line from Aarhus to <!--del_lnk--> Kalundborg on Zealand, the competition with Mols-linien was extended in summer 2012 as they inserted a fast ferry on the line.</p>
       <p>Aarhus has a free bike sharing system, <i>Aarhus Bycykler</i> (Aarhus City Bikes). The bicycles are available from 1 April to 30 October at 57 stands throughout the city and can be obtained by placing a DKK 20 coin in the release slot, just like caddies in a supermarket. The coin can be retrieved when the bike is returned. Bicycles can also be hired from many shops.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Aarhus Letbane is a planned <!--del_lnk--> tram-train project which will link two railway lines with a new light rail route through the city.</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_popular_culture">In popular culture</span></h2>
       <p>In Denmark, an "Aarhus story" &mdash; similar to a <!--del_lnk--> Molbo story &mdash; is a kind of derogatory <!--del_lnk--> ethnic joke. Such stories about the citizens of Aarhus began in the early 20th century and the term continues to be used colloquially. For example, one popular Aarhus story goes as follows. "Have you heard about the Aarhus citizen who was leafing through a phonebook and remarked: 'Jensen, Jensen, Jensen, Jensen, Jensen... How many phones does this guy have?'"</p>
