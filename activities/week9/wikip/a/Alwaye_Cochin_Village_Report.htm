<h3><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_MIImage_preview" alt="Child at Alwaye Cochin, India" />SOS Children's Village Alwaye-Cochin</h3>
<p>Two SOS Children's Villages were built not far from each other at Trichur
 and Alwaye-Cochin. Kerala is a very fertile agricultural region, with a
 high unemployment rate all the same. Construction of SOS Children's 
Village Alwaye-Cochin and its <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Schools.htm">SOS Nursery School</a> started in 1989.&nbsp; The 
first children moved into their new homes in 1990.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOS Children's 
Village Alwaye-Cochin consists of 15 family houses, staff accommodation,
 a multi-purpose hall, a sick bay, and the necessary administration and 
service area.&nbsp; At this SOS Children's Village, Christian, Hindu and 
Muslim children
 live together in peace.&nbsp; Behind each house, there is a small garden 
where vegetables and flowers can be grown.&nbsp; The children can get some 
exercise at the playground and sports field on the premises of the SOS 
Children's Village.</p>
<p> In the vicinity of the SOS Children's Village, 
there is a market, a railway station and a bus stop. In the town of 
Alwaye, there are various schools and hospitals.</p>
<h3>Other SOS Projects in Alwaye-Cochin</h3>
<p>In 1994, an SOS Youth Home was opened. Young people usually move 
from the SOS Children's Village to an SOS Youth Home when they start
 a vocational training course or go on to higher education. 
With the support of qualified youth workers, the young people develop 
realistic perspectives for their future, learn to shoulder 
responsibility and increasingly make their own decisions. They are 
encouraged to develop team spirit and build up contacts with relatives 
and friends, as well as with the relevant authorities and potential 
employers.</p>
<p>The <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Medical_Centres_A.htm">SOS Social Centre</a> caters to the local community and offers <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/f/Family_Strengthening_B.htm">family 
strengthening programmes</a>. These programmes are intended to support 
families at risk of abandoning their children and to encourage families 
to stay together. SOS Children's Villages therefore works with local 
authorities and other service providers to support families and enable 
them to take good care of their children.</p>
<p>The Alwaye-Cochin SOS Social 
Centre provides nutritional, educational and health support as well as 
vocational training, career counselling sessions and job placement 
support. Families are linked with existing self-help groups; if there is
 no group, a new one is formed. The SOS Social Centre also tries to 
raise awareness of hygiene and child rights and to improve people's 
parenting skills. At the affiliated day-care centre, young children of 
poor local families are looked after during the day so that their 
parents can go to work.</p>
<p>SOS Children's Village Alwaye-Cochin received the 1999 annual 
National Award of India for outstanding performance in the field of 
child development and welfare.</p>
<h3>Background to Alwaye-Cochin</h3>
<p>Alwaye, also know aa Aluva,&nbsp; is a town and a municipality in Ernakulam district and also a part of Kochi metropolitan area in the southern state of Kerala, <a title="SOS Children in India: Children for Sponsorship in India" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Children_In_India.htm">India</a>.&nbsp; It is one of the most industrialised towns in Kerala, though most of the factories are actually situated in the newly minted town Kalamassery.&nbsp; It is famous for the Aluva Sivarathri festival at Manal Puram (sand bank) on the banks of Periyar River.&nbsp; Aluva has a population of around 24,000.</p>
