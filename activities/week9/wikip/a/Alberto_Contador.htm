       <p><b>Alberto Contador Velasco</b> (<small>Spanish pronunciation:&nbsp;</small><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> [al&#x2C8;&beta;erto konta&#x2C8;&eth;or &beta;e&#x2C8;lasko]</span>; born 6 December 1982) is a Spanish professional cyclist, one of five riders to have won all three <!--del_lnk--> Grand Tours of road cycling. He was the winner of the <!--del_lnk--> 2007 Tour de France with the <!--del_lnk--> Discovery Channel team. With the Astana team he has won the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 Giro d'Italia, the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 Vuelta a Espa&ntilde;a and the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 Tour de France. He initially also won the <!--del_lnk--> 2010 Tour de France with this team, and the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Giro d'Italia with team Saxo Bank-SunGard, only to be stripped of these titles later having been found guilty of a doping offence. Following his return from a suspension, he won the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 Vuelta a Espa&ntilde;a.</p>
       <p>Contador has been widely considered to be the best <!--del_lnk--> climbing specialist and stage racer in the world. Notable summit stage finishes on which he has victories include the <!--del_lnk--> Alto de El Angliru in the Vuelta, the <!--del_lnk--> Plateau de Beille in the Tour and <!--del_lnk--> Mount Etna in the Giro. After being widely expected to lose his tenuous lead in the 2007 Tour de France in that race's final <!--del_lnk--> individual time trial, Contador has become a more accomplished time trialist, with several victories in the discipline. He has earned a reputation as an all-rounder, a cyclist who excels in all aspects of stage racing which are needed for high places in the <!--del_lnk--> general classification.</p>
       <p>Contador's career has been marked by doping allegations. The <!--del_lnk--> Operaci&oacute;n Puerto doping case led his <!--del_lnk--> Astana-W&uuml;rth team (a team unrelated to the current Astana team) to withdraw en masse from the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Tour de France before it began. He was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, but was also accused of doping after his victory in the race the following year. In September 2010, Contador announced that he had tested positive for <!--del_lnk--> clenbuterol in a control taken during that year's Tour de France, in which he finished as winner, but although he was suspended during an investigation, he was cleared by the <!--del_lnk--> RFEC. A review by the <!--del_lnk--> Court of Arbitration for Sport initially set for June 2011 was later deferred several times until February 2012, when the CAS decided that Contador be stripped from the results obtained in the 2010 Tour de France and later, which also caused him to lose his 2011 Giro d'Italia victory. He was also suspended until 5 August 2012, and his contract with <!--del_lnk--> Team Saxo Bank was annulled. Upon the completion of his ban, Contador rejoined the renamed Team Saxo Bank-Tinkoff Bank.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life_and_early_career">Personal life and early career</span></h2>
       <p>Contador was born in <!--del_lnk--> Pinto in the <!--del_lnk--> Community of Madrid, the third of four children. He has an older brother and sister and a younger brother, who has <!--del_lnk--> cerebral palsy. Having previously practised other sports, such as football and athletics, Contador discovered cycling at the age of 14 thanks to his elder brother Francisco Javier.</p>
       <p>When Contador was 15, he began to compete in races at the amateur level in Spain, joining the Real Velo Club Portillo from Madrid. Although he got no victories that year or the next, he demonstrated great qualities and was soon nicknamed <i>Pantani</i> (after <!--del_lnk--> Marco Pantani, regarded as one of the best climbers of all time) for his climbing skills. In 2000, he experienced his first victories, winning several mountains classification prizes from prominent events on the Spanish amateur cycling calendar.</p>
       <p>He dropped out of school at the age of 16 without having finished his <!--del_lnk--> Bachillerato and signed with Iberdrola-Loinaz, a youth team run by <!--del_lnk--> Manolo Saiz, manager of the professional <!--del_lnk--> ONCE cycling team. In 2001, he won the under-23 Spanish time trial championship.</p>
       <p>Contador lives with his wife Macarena in the city of Pinto when not competing, and enjoys hunting in his spare time. He has a fascination for birds, keeping personally bred canaries and goldfinches at home.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="ONCE.2FLiberty_Seguros_.282004.E2.80.932006.29">ONCE/Liberty Seguros (2004&ndash;2006)</span></h3>
       <p>Contador turned professional in 2003 for <!--del_lnk--> ONCE-Eroski. In his first year as a professional he won the eighth stage of the <!--del_lnk--> Tour de Pologne, an individual time trial. During the first stage of the 2004 <!--del_lnk--> Vuelta a Asturias he started to feel unwell, and after 40&nbsp;kilometers he fell and went into convulsions. He had been suffering from headaches for several days beforehand and was diagnosed with a cerebral <!--del_lnk--> cavernoma, a congenital vascular disorder, for which he underwent risky surgery and a recovery to get back on his bike. As a result of the surgery, he has a scar that runs from one ear to the other over the top of his head. Contador started to train again at the end of 2004 and eight months after the surgery he won the fifth stage of the 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Tour Down Under racing for Liberty Seguros, as the team previously known as ONCE had become. He went on to win the third stage and the overall classification of the <!--del_lnk--> Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme, thus winning his first <!--del_lnk--> stage race as a professional. He also won an individual time trial during the <!--del_lnk--> Tour of the Basque Country, where he finished third, and the fourth stage of the <!--del_lnk--> Tour de Romandie, where he finished fourth overall.</p>
       <p>In 2006, he won stages at the <!--del_lnk--> Tour de Romandie and <!--del_lnk--> Tour de Suisse in preparation for the <!--del_lnk--> Tour de France. Prior to the start of the race he was implicated along with several teammates in the <!--del_lnk--> Operaci&oacute;n Puerto doping case by the Spanish authorities, and the team was not able to start. He was later cleared by the <!--del_lnk--> Union Cycliste Internationale, cycling's <!--del_lnk--> governing body. Contador returned to racing in the <!--del_lnk--> Vuelta a Burgos but he crashed after finishing fifth in stage 4, when he was riding back down to the team bus, and briefly lost consciousness.</p>

       <p>After having been implicated in the <!--del_lnk--> Operaci&oacute;n Puerto doping case, Contador was without a professional contract until mid-January 2007, when he signed with <!--del_lnk--> Discovery Channel.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Contador's first major professional victory came with the <!--del_lnk--> 2007 Paris&ndash;Nice, which he won on the race's final stage. Discovery effectively wore down the remnants of the race leader <!--del_lnk--> Davide Rebellin's <!--del_lnk--> Gerolsteiner team, allowing Contador to launch an attack on the final climb. With Rebellin leading the chase, Contador held off his competitors in the final kilometers, winning him the race.</p>
       <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 2007 Tour de France, he won a stage at the mountaintop finish of <!--del_lnk--> Plateau-de-Beille, and was second in the <!--del_lnk--> general classification to <!--del_lnk--> Michael Rasmussen. Upon Rasmussen's removal from the race before stage 17 for lying to his team about his pre-race training whereabouts, Contador assumed the overall lead and the yellow jersey, though he did not don it until after the stage. In the stage 19 individual time trial, he managed to defy expectations and keep hold of the yellow jersey by a margin of only 23&nbsp;seconds over challenger <!--del_lnk--> Cadel Evans and 31&nbsp;seconds over teammate <!--del_lnk--> Levi Leipheimer. As this was the Tour's penultimate stage, it was the last real competition of the race (since the final stage is traditionally non-competitive save for a bunched sprint to the finish line) and it secured Contador his first Tour de France victory. It is the closest the top three finishers in the Tour de France have ever finished to one another.</p>
       <p>After Discovery Channel announced 2007 would be its final season in professional cycling, Contador announced on 23 October 2007 that he would move to the <!--del_lnk--> Astana team for 2008.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>On 13 February 2008, the organizer of the Tour de France, the <!--del_lnk--> Amaury Sport Organisation, announced that Astana would not be invited to any of their events in 2008 due to the doping previously perpetrated by Astana, despite the fact that its management and most of its ridership had changed before the 2008 season. Consequently, Contador was unable to defend his <!--del_lnk--> 2007 Paris&ndash;Nice and <!--del_lnk--> 2007 Tour de France victories. He went on to win his second <!--del_lnk--> Vuelta a Castilla y Le&oacute;n, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Tour of the Basque Country by winning the opening stage and the final individual time trial. His next scheduled race and objective was the <!--del_lnk--> Dauphin&eacute; Lib&eacute;r&eacute; but his team received an invite to the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 Giro d'Italia one week prior to the start of the race. Contador was on a beach in Spain when he was told he was going to ride the Giro. Despite the lack of preparation, he finished second in the first individual time trial and took the <!--del_lnk--> pink jersey after the 15th stage up to Passo Fedaia. Upon winning the final pink jersey in Milan, he became the first non-Italian to win the Giro d'Italia since <!--del_lnk--> Pavel Tonkov in <!--del_lnk--> 1996 and also the second Spanish rider to win the Giro after <!--del_lnk--> Miguel Indurain won in <!--del_lnk--> 1992 and <!--del_lnk--> 1993. He later emphasized the importance of this win by saying that "taking part in the Giro and winning it was a really big achievement, bigger than if I'd had a second victory in the Tour de France".</p>
       <p>At the <a href="../../wp/2/2008_Summer_Olympics.htm" title="2008 Summer Olympics">2008 Summer Olympics</a>, Contador competed in the <!--del_lnk--> road race and the <!--del_lnk--> individual road time trial. He did not finish in the road race, in which 53 of the 143&nbsp;starters did not complete the course in particularly hot and humid conditions. He placed fourth in the individual time trial, eight seconds behind his regular teammate Leipheimer.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Contador entered the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 Vuelta a Espa&ntilde;a as the main candidate to win. His biggest challenger was likely to be compatriot <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Sastre, who had won the <!--del_lnk--> Tour de France just a month before. Contador won stage 13 by attacking on the fabled <!--del_lnk--> Angliru climb and this resulted in him capturing the <!--del_lnk--> golden jersey as the leader of the race. He extended his lead by winning stage 14 to Fuentes de Invierno and maintained his lead in subsequent flat stages and the final time trial. That final time trial was won by Leipheimer by a wide margin. Contador later took some offense to Leipheimer seemingly riding with winning the Vuelta in mind, after it had been established earlier in the race that Contador was Astana's team leader. In the final standings, Contador finished 46&nbsp;seconds ahead of Leipheimer and more than four minutes ahead of Sastre. The win made him the fifth cyclist to win all three Grand Tours, after <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Anquetil, <!--del_lnk--> Felice Gimondi, <!--del_lnk--> Eddy Merckx, and <a href="../../wp/b/Bernard_Hinault.htm" title="Bernard Hinault">Bernard Hinault</a>. In the process he also became the first Spaniard, youngest (age 25), and shortest amount of time to accumulate all three wins (15&nbsp;months). He also became only the third cyclist to win the Giro and the Vuelta in the same year, joining Merckx (who did it in 1973) and <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Battaglin (who did it in 1981).</p>
       <p>Later in the year, Contador won the <!--del_lnk--> V&eacute;lo d'Or award for the best rider of the year for the second consecutive season. The Giro and Vuelta winner beat Olympic time-trial champion <!--del_lnk--> Fabian Cancellara and Tour winner <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Sastre in a vote by international cycling writers.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2009_season">2009 season</span></h3>
       <p>On 9 September 2008, the seven-time Tour de France winner <a href="../../wp/l/Lance_Armstrong.htm" title="Lance Armstrong">Lance Armstrong</a> announced that he was returning to professional cycling with the express goal of participating in the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 Tour de France. <!--del_lnk--> Astana manager <!--del_lnk--> Johan Bruyneel, Armstrong's former mentor and <!--del_lnk--> sporting director, said that he could not allow Armstrong riding for another team and later signed him. The announcement by Armstrong clashed with the ambitions of Contador, who insisted he deserved the leadership of Astana, and hinted at the possibility of leaving the team if he was given a secondary role supporting Armstrong. Contador was later given assurances by Bruyneel that he would remain team leader and decided to remain at Astana for the 2009 season. Contador later claimed the situation was drastically overblown by the media. Contador decided to miss the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 Giro d'Italia to focus on winning the Tour de France.</p>
       <p>Contador started his 2009 season at the <!--del_lnk--> Volta ao Algarve race in Portugal, winning the overall classification, placing second on stage 3, and winning the decisive 33&nbsp;km individual time trial. He was in position to win <!--del_lnk--> Paris&ndash;Nice again after winning the prologue and the toughest mountain stage, but suffered a breakdown in stage 7, losing his yellow jersey to fellow Spaniard <!--del_lnk--> Luis Leon S&aacute;nchez. Contador and his Astana team later blamed the breakdown on Contador eating inadequately, leaving him without the energy to chase attacks. Contador finished fourth overall. Contador continued his build up to the <!--del_lnk--> Tour by racing the <!--del_lnk--> Dauphin&eacute; Lib&eacute;r&eacute;. He put in a strong performance of the opening time trial and stayed in touch with race leader <!--del_lnk--> Cadel Evans on the longer time trial. However, the strong ride of compatriot <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro Valverde up the <!--del_lnk--> Ventoux distanced Contador and he rode to help Valverde take the Yellow Jersey while finishing comfortably in third place overall.</p>

       <p>On 26 June 2009, Contador competed in the Time Trial of the Spanish National Championships. He stated that he entered the race in order to gain more experience on his new Trek TT bike, but he came away with a convincing victory over Luis Le&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez, the defending champion, winning by 37&nbsp;seconds. This is his first National Championship as a professional.</p>
       <p>Contador won Stage 15 of the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 Tour de France by soloing to the finish line more than a minute ahead of most of his closest GC competitors, and in so doing took the <!--del_lnk--> general classification leader's yellow jersey. He then extended his lead on Stage 17, after finishing second in a breakaway of three riders with the same time as the stage winner, and then the next day he won the second time trial, increasing his overall advantage to more than four minutes.</p>
       <p>Contador won his second <a href="../../wp/t/Tour_de_France.htm" title="Tour de France">Tour de France</a> on 26 July 2009 with a winning margin of 4'11" over <!--del_lnk--> Andy Schleck. He finished 5'24" ahead of <a href="../../wp/l/Lance_Armstrong.htm" title="Lance Armstrong">Lance Armstrong</a>, who finished third in his return to the Tour after a four-year absence. Contador has won the last four <!--del_lnk--> Grand Tour races that he has entered. During the celebration at the podium, the organizers of the Tour wrongly played the <!--del_lnk--> Danish National Anthem instead of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Royal March. In the aftermath of the tour, Contador and Armstrong engaged in a war of words, with Contador quoted as saying that, although Armstrong "is a great rider and [..] did a great Tour[, but] on a personal level [..] I have never admired him and never will", and Armstrong responding that "a champion is also measured on how much he respects his teammates and opponents." The sniping caused others, such as the director of the Tour, to wonder "what it would have been like to have had Contador and Armstrong in different teams."</p>
       <p>On 31 July, Contador's agent (who is also his brother) announced that Contador had turned down an offer to remain with Astana under a new four-year contract because he had felt so uncomfortable being caught between the Kazakhstan owners of the team on one side and Bruyneel on the other, and he was hoping to leave Astana at the end of the year, although his contract did not expire until the end of 2010. However, on 11 August, Contador's teammate and close friend <!--del_lnk--> S&eacute;rgio Paulinho accepted a two-year contract with <!--del_lnk--> Team RadioShack, indicating that Contador might not be able to leave Astana as readily as he and his agent wished. This was confirmed on 15 August, when a spokesperson for the Kazakhstan sponsors of Astana said that they intended to sponsor the Astana team on the UCI ProTour through 2013 and that they intended to enforce the last year of Contador's contract with Astana in 2010.</p>

       </div>
       <p>On 21 February, Contador won his first race of the season, the <!--del_lnk--> Volta ao Algarve, by winning its queen stage and finishing second in the final time trial. Due to new UCI regulations concerning the nose cone of time trial bikes, Contador did not use his Shiv time trial bike, and instead used the standard red Specialized time trial bike. On 14 March, Contador won his second <!--del_lnk--> Paris&ndash;Nice, finishing ahead of other pre-race favorites like <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro Valverde and <!--del_lnk--> Luis Le&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez. His main attack came in the mountaintop finish to Mende, where he crossed the finish line alone and successfully secured the yellow jersey. Contador also competed in and concluded the Criterium International with a second place in the final time trial, only 2&nbsp;seconds behind stage winner <!--del_lnk--> David Millar, while <!--del_lnk--> Pierrick F&eacute;drigo successfully defended the <i>maillot jaune</i> against rivals such as <!--del_lnk--> Cadel Evans and <!--del_lnk--> Samuel S&aacute;nchez.</p>
       <p>Contador was a favorite coming into the <!--del_lnk--> 2010 Tour de France, along with Team Saxo Bank's <!--del_lnk--> Andy Schleck. On Stage 15 Schleck was race leader and pressing the pace over the day's final climb of Port de Bales when he threw his <!--del_lnk--> chain. Contador and Denis Menchov immediately moved to the front and attacked, pressing the advantage over the crest of the climb and all the way back down into Bagneres-de-Luchon. They were aided by Sammy Sanchez and two others making a group of five riders. Schleck chased hard, but had no other riders to help bridge the gap. By stage's end, he had lost the yellow Jersey and 39&nbsp;seconds to Contador. Contador, who now had an eight-second lead in the race, met with a mixed reception as he received the yellow jersey on the podium at the end of the stage. It is an unusual occurrence in the Tour for the new race leader to be met with whistles and cat calls as he is given the yellow jersey. The yellow jersey changing shoulders made a large difference in the remainder of the race, for now the onus was on Schleck to attack Contador, and not the other way around.</p>
       <p>Jered Gruber, writing for <i>Velo Nation</i>, argued that Contador was right to attack, defending him on the basis that Schleck did not wait for Contador when he was delayed behind a crash on the cobblestones in stage 3 and lost 1' 13" to Schleck, a crash that cost Schleck the aid of his best ally in the tour, his brother <!--del_lnk--> Fr&auml;nk Schleck. But of course that was early in the race and neither rider had the yellow jersey at the time. Race commentator Paul Sherwen thought the attack in poor form, whereas his co-commentor Phil Liggett thought not. Schleck said he considered Contador's actions to be unsporting. Hours after the conclusion of the stage, Contador voiced an apology for his behaviour on his YouTube channel. Five days later in the stage 19 time trial, Contador beat Schleck again, taking 31&nbsp;seconds from him. Contador went on to win the Tour de France for the third time with an advantage of 39&nbsp;seconds over Andy Schleck, the exact amount of time he had taken from Schleck on Stage 15. Contador became the seventh rider to win a Tour de France without winning a stage.</p>
       <p>Contador has signed a two-year contract with <!--del_lnk--> Saxo Bank-SunGard for the 2011 season, to ride under team manager <!--del_lnk--> Bjarne Riis, who revealed that he would like Contador to try winning all three <!--del_lnk--> Grand Tours in one season, a feat never before accomplished. Contador's agent and brother Fran later countered the statement by saying it was "nothing but a dream". Within two weeks, three of Contador's Spanish teammates signed to make the same transfer: <!--del_lnk--> Jes&uacute;s Hern&aacute;ndez, <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Navarro and <!--del_lnk--> Benjam&iacute;n Noval.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Amidst the clenbuterol controversy, Contador earned his first win in the Vuelta a Murcia. He won the overall classification as well as two stage victories en route to his victory. Later in the month of March, Contador entered in the <!--del_lnk--> Volta a Catalunya, where he claimed a win on the third stage to <!--del_lnk--> Vallnord, maintaining his advantage until the end of the race. He also won the individual time trial of <!--del_lnk--> Vuelta a Castilla y Le&oacute;n.</p>
       <p>Contador competed in the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Giro d'Italia, his first time racing in the Giro since his victory in <!--del_lnk--> 2008. Contador won the <!--del_lnk--> ninth stage on <!--del_lnk--> Mount Etna, his first stage win at the Italian Grand Tour. That stage gave him the overall lead in the Giro, as well as the points classification. He also won the 12.7&nbsp;km (7.9&nbsp;mi) mountain time-trial to Nevegal. On 29 May, Contador went on to win the <!--del_lnk--> race for the second time. In addition to winning the General Classification, Contador also won the Points Classification and finished second in the Mountains classification.</p>
       <p>Despite the fact that he was scheduled to appear before the <!--del_lnk--> Court of Arbitration for Sport in early August, Contador announced in early June he would compete in the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Tour de France. The CAS had planned to hear the case in early June but the dates were pushed back to early August. Contador aimed to become the first rider to win both the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France in the same year since <!--del_lnk--> Marco Pantani accomplished the feat in 1998.</p>
       <p>In the opening stage Contador got slowed down by a crash and lost more than one minute. He lost additional time in the <!--del_lnk--> team time trial at <!--del_lnk--> Les Essarts but finished second in the fourth stage up to <!--del_lnk--> M&ucirc;r-de-Bretagne. Contador suffered four crashes in the opening nine days of the Tour, injuring his right knee before facing the Pyrenees mountain stages. He was dropped in the final kilometer in the stage to <!--del_lnk--> Luz Ardiden and finished two seconds behind <!--del_lnk--> Andy Schleck at the top of the <!--del_lnk--> Plateau de Beille. On the sixteenth stage to <!--del_lnk--> Gap, Contador attacked on the ascent of the Col de Manse, with <!--del_lnk--> Cadel Evans and <!--del_lnk--> Samuel S&aacute;nchez joining him in taking a time advantage over the other favorites in the general classification, including more than a minute over Andy Schleck. He was also aggressive in the next stage to <!--del_lnk--> Pinerolo but unable to win time to the other favorites besides <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Voeckler and <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Basso. In the stage to <!--del_lnk--> Col du Galibier he lost time to the other favorites after Andy Schleck launched a solo attack sixty kilometers from the finish and Contador was later unable to follow the pace set by Cadel Evans. Contador launched an early attack on the last mountain stage to <!--del_lnk--> Alpe d'Huez, reaching the top of Galibier with Andy Schleck, but their effort proved unsuccessful and they were captured by the rest of the main contenders following the long descent from the mountain. Contador launched another attack on the first kilometers of Alpe d'Huez but he was eventually beaten to victory by <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Rolland with <!--del_lnk--> Samuel S&aacute;nchez second. Contador finished fifth in the overall classification, 3&nbsp;minutes 57&nbsp;seconds behind <!--del_lnk--> Cadel Evans, bringing an end to his streak of six consecutive <!--del_lnk--> Grand Tour victories.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2012_season">2012 season</span></h3>
       <p>Contador started his season with still no verdict in the clenbuterol case. He finished second overall in the <!--del_lnk--> Tour de San Luis and he won both uphill finishes. He only fell short in the time trial stage of the race. On 6 February he was stripped of these early results, as well the <!--del_lnk--> 2010 Tour de France and <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Giro d'Italia wins and many other victories. He was also suspended until 5 August 2012 and his contract with <!--del_lnk--> Team Saxo Bank was annulled.</p>
       <p>On 8 June it was announced that Contador would rejoin Team Saxo Bank-Tinkoff Bank upon the completion of his ban, signing a contract that will keep him with the team until the end of the 2015 season. After the completion of his suspension, Contador competed in the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 Eneco Tour as preparation for the <!--del_lnk--> Vuelta a Espa&ntilde;a where he finished 4th in the general classification. Consequently, Contador was named leader of Team Saxo Bank-Tinkoff Bank for the <!--del_lnk--> Vuelta a Espa&ntilde;a. Contador attacked numerous times throughout the mountains in the first sixteen stages of the race, but with no avail, since the race leader <!--del_lnk--> Joaquim Rodr&iacute;guez always countered and finished ahead of him. This proved costly since there were bonus seconds awarded to the first three riders of each stage: twelve seconds for first, eight seconds for second and four seconds for third. Even on the <!--del_lnk--> queen stage of the race, finishing atop the <!--del_lnk--> Cuitu Negru and featuring slopes with a gradient of more than 20% close to the line, Rodriguez annulled the numerous attacks of Contador and sailed past him to the finish. However, his fortunes turned around during the <!--del_lnk--> seventeenth stage; he attacked in that latter portion of the stage and made a solo effort up the final climb of the day after his breakaway companion <!--del_lnk--> Paolo Tiralongo of <!--del_lnk--> Astana was dropped. Contador won the stage by six seconds over the first chase group and took the lead away from Joaquim Rodr&iacute;guez, who was relegated to more than two minutes in the general classification. He held on to the race lead during <!--del_lnk--> the last mountain stage leading atop the Bola del Mondo, where he was dropped by Rodriguez and <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro Valverde (<!--del_lnk--> Movistar Team), who held the second place overall. He managed to limit his losses and retain the lead of the race. On the next day, Contador crossed the finish line in <a href="../../wp/m/Madrid.htm" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> with the race leader's red jersey, earned the second Vuelta victory of his career.</p>
       <p>Contador participated to the <!--del_lnk--> World Championships held in <!--del_lnk--> Valkenburg in both the road race and the time trial. He took the ninth place in the individual effort, after being overtaken by eventual winner <!--del_lnk--> Tony Martin, who started two minutes behind him. For the road race, Contador rode in support of his Spaniard teammates and finished 53 seconds in arrears of the victor, Belgian <!--del_lnk--> Philippe Gilbert. Days later, Contador headed for Italy to take part in the newly resurrected Classic <!--del_lnk--> Milano&ndash;Torino. He took the win by accelerating on the final slope of the day in sight of the 'one kilometer' banner, dropping all contenders. It was the first time in his career that he won a single-day race, and he dedicated the event to the memory of <!--del_lnk--> Victor Cabedo, a young professional cyclist who died in a training accident a week prior.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Operation_Puerto">Operation Puerto</span></h3>
       <p>After final rosters had been presented for the 2006 Tour de France, Contador and five other members of the Astana-W&uuml;rth team were barred from competing due to alleged connections with the <!--del_lnk--> Operaci&oacute;n Puerto doping case. Contador and four other members of his team at the time, <!--del_lnk--> Astana-W&uuml;rth, were eventually cleared of all charges on 26 July 2006 by the Spanish courts and later two out of the five (including Contador) were cleared by the UCI. Each received a written document signed by Manuel S&aacute;nchez Mart&iacute;n, secretary for the Spanish court, stating that "there are not any type of charges against them nor have there been adopted any type of legal action against them."</p>
       <p>In May 2006, a document from the summary of the investigation (<i>Documento 31</i>) was released. In it, Contador's initials (A.C.) were associated with a hand-written note saying, "<i>Nada o igual a J.J.</i>" (Spanish for "Nothing or like J.J."). J.J. were the initials of <!--del_lnk--> J&ouml;rg Jaksche, who later admitted to being guilty of <!--del_lnk--> blood doping prepared by the Spanish doctor <!--del_lnk--> Eufemiano Fuentes in 2005. Contador was questioned in December 2006 by the magistrate in charge of the Puerto file. The rider declared to Judge Antonio Serrano that he did not know Eufemiano Fuentes personally. According to French daily <i><!--del_lnk--> Le Monde</i>, he refused then to undergo a <!--del_lnk--> DNA test that would have judged whether or not he had any link to the blood bags that were found in the investigation.</p>
       <p>On 28 July 2007, <i>Le Monde</i>, citing what it claimed was an investigation file to which it had access, stated that Contador's name appeared in several documents found during Operaci&oacute;n Puerto. A second reference includes initials of riders&rsquo; names that appeared on another training document, although neither of those two references could be linked to doping practices.</p>
       <p>On 30 July 2007, German doping expert <!--del_lnk--> Werner Franke accused Contador of having taken drugs in the past and being prescribed a doping regimen by Fuentes, who was connected with Operaci&oacute;n Puerto. He passed his allegations on to the German authorities on 31 July 2007. Contador denied the accusations, saying "I was in the wrong team at the wrong time and somehow my name got among the documents." On 10 August, Contador publicly declared himself to be a clean rider in face of suspicions about his alleged links to the Operaci&oacute;n Puerto blood doping ring.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2009_Verbier_climb">2009 Verbier climb</span></h3>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 Tour de France, former Tour champion <a href="../../wp/g/Greg_LeMond.htm" title="Greg LeMond">Greg LeMond</a> wrote a column for <i><!--del_lnk--> Le Monde</i> in which he noted that Contador's time up <!--del_lnk--> Verbier was the fastest climb in the history of the Tour, which LeMond claimed would require a level of oxygen transport (<!--del_lnk--> VO<sub>2</sub>) "that has never been achieved by any athlete in any sport," and demanded that Contador prove that he was capable of that level of aerobic ability "without falling back to the use of performance enhancing products." At a press conference later that day, Contador refused to answer questions about the article. Subsequently, other experts disagreed with the calculations in LeMond's article, which were done by French physiology professor Antoine Vayer, who was a trainer for the <!--del_lnk--> Festina cycling team until the <!--del_lnk--> Festina affair in 1998. Two physiologists claimed Vayer's assumptions overstate the needed level of oxygen transport, and that the level Contador needed, while "still quite high," is "not so high that you can definitively state that it can only be achieved via doping." A third, who noted that Vayer is the leading expert in this field and "more than anyone, knows how to look at a climb in context", nevertheless also questioned Vayer's assumptions.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2010_Tour_de_France">2010 Tour de France</span></h3>
       <p>In September 2010, Contador revealed that a urine sample he had given on 21 July, a rest day in the <!--del_lnk--> 2010 Tour de France, had contained traces of <!--del_lnk--> clenbuterol. He has stated, due to the number of other tests he passed and that only a tiny amount of the substance was detected in the one he failed, that food contamination was to blame. Adding credibility to the explanation, anti-doping doctor <!--del_lnk--> Don Catlin said that of the contaminants found in food supplements, clenbuterol is one of the more common. However, when asked if it was plausible that Contador had ingested the clenbuterol through contamination, Catlin said "without knowing what the level in his sample is, it's impossible to say." Contador stated that he is the victim, and he can "hold his head high" and that he thinks he should not be punished. Several people related to the sport defended Contador saying that there is little benefit from using the drug in the amounts that were discovered and that no one would intentionally take such an easily detectable substance.</p>
       <p>There has been some scepticism of Contador's claim that contaminated meat was to blame. In 2008 and 2009, only one animal sample came back positive for clenbuterol out of 83,203 animal samples tested by EU member nations. Out of 19,431 animal tests in Spain over the same period, there were no samples that came back positive for clenbuterol. Contador's urine sample, taken during the day before his clenbuterol positive sample, was reported to contain plastic residue indicating possible <!--del_lnk--> blood doping, but the test is not recognised by the <!--del_lnk--> World Anti-Doping Agency, so no charges in relation to this finding were brought. A theory has circulated that blood doping could account for the minute traces if the clenbuterol was introduced through a transfusion of already contaminated blood, rather than ingestion or injection.</p>
       <p>The UCI issued a statement reporting that the concentration was 50 <!--del_lnk--> picograms per millilitre, and that this was 400 times below the minimum standards of detection capability required by <!--del_lnk--> WADA, and that further scientific investigation would be required. Contador was provisionally suspended from competition, although this had no short-term effect as he had already finished his racing programme for the 2010 season. Contador had been informed of the results over a month earlier, on 24 August. Later the amount discovered was clarified as 40 times below the minimum standards, rather than the 400 times originally reported by the UCI. Contador's scientific adviser claimed that he would have needed 180 times the amount detected to gain any benefit in his performance.</p>
       <p>In late January 2011, the Spanish Cycling Federation (<!--del_lnk--> RFEC) proposed a one-year ban, but it subsequently accepted Contador's appeal and cleared him of all charges. Contador returned to racing in February in the <!--del_lnk--> Volta ao Algarve, a race he won in 2009 and 2010. The UCI and the <!--del_lnk--> World Anti-Doping Agency each appealed the RFEC decision independently to the <!--del_lnk--> Court of Arbitration for Sport in March 2011, but Contador remained free to ride until the CAS made its ruling. The hearing with CAS was initially scheduled for June, but following an extension requested by Contador's legal team, it was rearranged for August, in the week following the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Tour de France, and later postponed again until November 2011, with the result to be given in 2012. The decision on 6 February 2012 was that Contador lost his 2010 Tour de France title, and his results since that race, including victory in the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Giro d'Italia and fifth place in the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Tour de France, were voided, and he was suspended until August 2012. The following day, in a press conference, his contract with Team Saxo Bank was annulled.</p>
