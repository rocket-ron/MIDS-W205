       <p><b>Amnesty International</b> (commonly known as <b>Amnesty</b> and <b>AI</b>) is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Non-governmental_organization.htm" title="Non-governmental organisation">non-governmental organisation</a> focused on <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> with over 3 million members and supporters around the world. The objective of the organisation is "to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated."</p>
       <p>Amnesty International was founded in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> in 1961, following the publication of the article "<!--del_lnk--> The Forgotten Prisoners" in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Observer</i> 28 May 1961, by the lawyer <!--del_lnk--> Peter Benenson. Amnesty draws attention to human rights abuses and campaigns for compliance with <a href="../../wp/i/International_law.htm" title="International law">international laws</a> and standards. It works to mobilise <!--del_lnk--> public opinion to put pressure on governments that let abuse take place. The organisation was awarded the 1977 <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for its "campaign against <!--del_lnk--> torture," and the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1978.</p>
       <p>In the field of international human rights organisations, Amnesty has the longest history and broadest name recognition, and "is believed by many to set standards for the movement as a whole."</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="1960s">1960s</span></h2>
       <p>Amnesty International was founded in London in July 1961 by English labour lawyer <!--del_lnk--> Peter Benenson. According to his own account, he was travelling in the <a href="../../wp/l/London_Underground.htm" title="London Underground">London Underground</a> on 19 November 1960, when he read of two Portuguese students from <!--del_lnk--> Coimbra who had been sentenced to seven years of imprisonment in Portugal for allegedly "having drunk a toast to liberty". Researchers have never traced the alleged newspaper article in question. In 1960, Portugal was ruled by the <!--del_lnk--> Estado Novo government of <!--del_lnk--> Ant&oacute;nio de Oliveira Salazar. The government was authoritarian in nature and strongly <!--del_lnk--> anti-communist, supressing enemies of the state as anti-Portuguese. In his significant newspaper article "<!--del_lnk--> The Forgotten Prisoners", Benenson later described his reaction as follows: "Open your newspaper any day of the week and you will find a story from somewhere of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government [...] The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence. Yet if these feelings of disgust could be united into common action, something effective could be done."</p>
       <p>Benenson worked with friend <!--del_lnk--> Eric Baker. Baker was a member of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Quakers.htm" title="Religious Society of Friends">Religious Society of Friends</a> who had been involved in funding the British <a href="../../wp/c/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament.htm" title="Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> as well as becoming head of <!--del_lnk--> Quaker Peace and Social Witness, and in his memoirs Benenson described him as "a partner in the launching of the project". In consultation with other writers, academics and lawyers and, in particular, <!--del_lnk--> Alec Digges, they wrote via <!--del_lnk--> Louis Blom-Cooper to <!--del_lnk--> David Astor, editor of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Observer</i> newspaper, who, on 28 May 1961, published Benenson's article "<!--del_lnk--> The Forgotten Prisoners". The article brought the reader's attention to those "imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government" or, put another way, to violations, by governments, of articles 18 and 19 of the <a href="../../wp/u/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights.htm" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR). The article described these violations occurring, on a global scale, in the context of restrictions to press freedom, to political oppositions, to timely <!--del_lnk--> public trial before impartial courts, and to asylum. It marked the launch of "Appeal for Amnesty, 1961", the aim of which was to mobilise public opinion, quickly and widely, in defence of these individuals, whom Benenson named "Prisoners of Conscience". The "Appeal for Amnesty" was reprinted by a large number of international newspapers. In the same year Benenson had a book published, <i>Persecution 1961</i>, which detailed the cases of nine <!--del_lnk--> prisoners of conscience investigated and compiled by Benenson and Baker (<!--del_lnk--> Maurice Adin, <!--del_lnk--> Ashton Jones, <!--del_lnk--> Agostinho Neto, <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Duncan, <!--del_lnk--> Olga Ivinskaya, <!--del_lnk--> Luis Taruc, <!--del_lnk--> Constantin Noica, <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Amat and <!--del_lnk--> Hu Feng). In July 1961 the leadership had decided that the appeal would form the basis of a permanent organisation, Amnesty, with the first meeting taking place in London. Benenson ensured that all three major political parties were represented, enlisting Members of Parliament from the <a href="../../wp/l/Labour_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Conservative_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Conservative Party (UK)">the Conservative Party</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> the Liberal Party. On 30 September 1962, it was officially named 'Amnesty International'. Between the 'Appeal for Amnesty, 1961' and September 1962 the organisation had been known simply as 'Amnesty'.</p>
       <p>What started as a short appeal soon became a permanent international movement working to protect those imprisoned for non-violent expression of their views and to secure worldwide recognition of Articles 18 and 19 of the UDHR. From the very beginning, research and campaigning were present in Amnesty International's work. A library was established for information about prisoners of conscience and a network of local groups, called 'THREES' groups, was started. Each group worked on behalf of three prisoners, one from each of the then three main ideological regions of the world: <!--del_lnk--> communist, <!--del_lnk--> capitalist and <!--del_lnk--> developing.</p>
       <p>By the mid-1960s Amnesty International's global presence was growing and an International Secretariat and International Executive Committee were established to manage Amnesty International's national organisations, called 'Sections', which had appeared in several countries. The international movement was starting to agree on its core principles and techniques. For example, the issue of whether or not to adopt prisoners who had advocated violence, like <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>, brought unanimous agreement that it could not give the name of 'Prisoner of Conscience' to such prisoners. Aside from the work of the library and groups, Amnesty International's activities were expanding to helping prisoners' families, sending observers to trials, making representations to governments, and finding asylum or overseas employment for prisoners. Its activity and influence were also increasing within intergovernmental organisations; it would be awarded consultative status by the United Nations, the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Europe and <a href="../../wp/u/UNESCO.htm" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> before the decade ended.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="1970s">1970s</span></h2>
       <p>Leading Amnesty International in the 1970s were key figureheads <!--del_lnk--> Se&aacute;n MacBride and <!--del_lnk--> Martin Ennals. While continuing to work for prisoners of conscience, Amnesty International's purview widened to include "<!--del_lnk--> fair trial" and opposition to long <!--del_lnk--> detention without trial (UDHR Article 9), and especially to the torture of prisoners (UDHR Article 5). Amnesty International believed that the reasons underlying torture of prisoners by governments, were either to acquire and obtain information or to quell opposition by the use of terror, or both. Also of concern was the export of more sophisticated torture methods, equipment and teaching by the superpowers to "client states", for example by the United States through <!--del_lnk--> some activities of the CIA.</p>
       <p>Amnesty International drew together reports from countries where torture allegations seemed most persistent and organised an international conference on torture. It sought to influence public opinion in order to put pressure on national governments by organising a campaign for the 'Abolition of Torture' which ran for several years.</p>
       <p>Amnesty International's membership increased from 15,000 in 1969 to 200,000 by 1979. This growth in resources enabled an expansion of its program, 'outside of the prison walls', to include work on <!--del_lnk--> "disappearances", the <!--del_lnk--> death penalty and the rights of refugees. A new technique, the 'Urgent Action', aimed at mobilising the membership into action rapidly was pioneered. The first was issued on 19 March 1973, on behalf of Luiz Basilio Rossi, a Brazilian academic, arrested for political reasons.</p>
       <p>At the intergovernmental level Amnesty International pressed for application of the UN's <!--del_lnk--> Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and of existing humanitarian conventions; to secure ratifications of the two <!--del_lnk--> UN Covenants on Human Rights in 1976); and was instrumental in obtaining additional instruments and provisions forbidding its practice. Consultative status was granted at the <!--del_lnk--> Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 1972.</p>
       <p>In 1976 Amnesty's British Section started a series of fund-raising events that came to be known as <!--del_lnk--> The Secret Policeman's Balls series. They were staged in London initially as comedy galas featuring what the Daily Telegraph called "the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the British comedy world" including members of comedy troupe <a href="../../wp/m/Monty_Python.htm" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a>, and later expanded to also include performances by leading rock musicians. The series was created and developed by Monty Python alumnus <!--del_lnk--> John Cleese and entertainment industry executive <!--del_lnk--> Martin Lewis working closely with Amnesty staff members <!--del_lnk--> Peter Luff (Assistant Director of Amnesty 1974&ndash;1978) and subsequently with Peter Walker (Amnesty Fund-Raising Officer 1978&ndash;1982). Cleese, Lewis and Luff worked together on the first two shows (1976 and 1977). Cleese, Lewis and Walker worked together on the 1979 and 1981 shows, the first to carry what the Daily Telegraph described as the "rather brilliantly re-christened" <i>Secret Policeman's Ball</i> title.</p>
       <p>The organisation was awarded the 1977 <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for its "campaign against <!--del_lnk--> torture" and the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1978.</p>

       <p>By 1980 Amnesty International was drawing more criticism from governments. The <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a> alleged that Amnesty International conducted espionage, the Moroccan government denounced it as a defender of lawbreakers, and the Argentine government banned Amnesty International's 1983 annual report.</p>
       <p>Throughout the 1980s, Amnesty International continued to campaign against torture, and on behalf of prisoners of conscience. New issues emerged, including <!--del_lnk--> extrajudicial killings, military, security and police transfers, political killings; and disappearances.</p>
       <p>Towards the end of the decade, the growing number of refugees worldwide was a very visible area of Amnesty International's concern. While many of the world's refugees of the time had been displaced by war and <a href="../../wp/f/Famine.htm" title="Famine">famine</a>, in adherence to its mandate, Amnesty International concentrated on those forced to flee because of the human rights violations it was seeking to prevent. It argued that rather than focusing on new restrictions on entry for asylum-seekers, governments were to address the human rights violations which were forcing people into exile.</p>
       <p>Apart from a second campaign on torture during the first half of the decade, two major musical events occurred, designed to increase awareness of Amnesty and of human rights (particularly among younger generations) during the mid- to late-1980s. The 1986 <!--del_lnk--> Conspiracy of Hope tour, which played five concerts in the U.S., and culminated in a daylong show, featuring some thirty-odd acts at Giants Stadium, and the 1988 <!--del_lnk--> Human Rights Now! world tour. Human Rights Now!, which was timed to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the United Nations' <a href="../../wp/u/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights.htm" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR), played a series of concerts on five continents over six weeks. Both tours featured some of the most famous musicians and bands of the day.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="1990s">1990s</span></h2>
       <p>Throughout the 1990s, Amnesty International continued to grow, to a membership of over 3 million in over 150 countries and territories, led by Senegalese Secretary General <!--del_lnk--> Pierre San&eacute;. Amnesty continued to work on a wide range of issues and world events. For example, South African groups joined in 1992 and hosted a visit by Pierre San&eacute; to meet with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Apartheid_in_South_Africa.htm" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> government to press for an investigation into allegations of police abuse, an end to arms sales to the <a href="../../wp/a/African_Great_Lakes.htm" title="African Great Lakes">African Great Lakes</a> region and the abolition of the death penalty. In particular, Amnesty International brought attention to violations committed on specific groups, including <!--del_lnk--> refugees, racial/ethnic/religious minorities, women and those executed or on <!--del_lnk--> Death Row. The death penalty report <i>When the state kills</i> (<!--del_lnk--> ISBN 978-0-691-10261-0) and the 'Human Rights are Women's Rights' campaign were key actions for the latter two issues. During the 1990s, Amnesty International was forced to react to human rights violations occurring in the context of a proliferation of armed conflict in <a href="../../wp/a/Angola.htm" title="Angola">Angola</a>, East Timor, the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, Rwanda, and the former <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. Amnesty International took no position on whether to support or oppose external military interventions in these armed conflicts. It did not (and does not) reject the use of force, even lethal force, or ask those engaged to lay down their arms. Instead, it questioned the motives behind external intervention and selectivity of international action in relation to the strategic interests of those sending troops. It argued that action should be taken to prevent human rights problems becoming human rights catastrophes, and that both intervention and inaction represented a failure of the <!--del_lnk--> international community.</p>
       <p>In 1995, when AI wanted to promote how Shell Oil Company was involved with the execution of an environmental and human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in Nigeria, it was stopped. Newspapers and advertising companies refused to run AI&rsquo;s ads because Shell Oil was a customer of theirs as well. Shell&rsquo;s main argument was that it was drilling oil in a country that already violated human rights and had no way to enforce human rights policies. To combat the buzz that AI was trying to create, it immediately publicized how Shell was helping to improve overall life in Nigeria. Salil Shetty, the director of Amnesty, said, "Social media re-energises the idea of the global citizen". James M. Russell notes how the drive for profit from private media sources conflicts with the stories that AI wants to be heard.</p>
       <p>Amnesty International was proactive in pushing for recognition of the universality of human rights. The campaign 'Get Up, Sign Up' marked 50 years of the UDHR. Thirteen million pledges were collected in support, and the Decl music concert was held in Paris on 10 December 1998 (<!--del_lnk--> Human Rights Day). At the intergovernmental level, Amnesty International argued in favour of creating an <!--del_lnk--> United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (established 1993) and an <!--del_lnk--> International Criminal Court (established 2002).</p>
       <p>After his arrest in London in 1998 by the <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Police, Amnesty International became involved in the legal battle of Senator Pinochet, a former Chilean President, who sought to avoid extradition to Spain to face charges. <!--del_lnk--> Lord Hoffman had an indirect connection with Amnesty International, and this led to an important test for the appearance of bias in legal proceedings in UK law. There was a suit against the decision to release Senator Pinochet, taken by the then British <!--del_lnk--> Home Secretary Mr Jack Straw, before that decision had actually been taken, in an attempt to prevent the release of Senator Pinochet. The English <a href="../../wp/h/High_Court_of_Justice.htm" title="High Court of Justice">High Court</a> refused the application and Senator Pinochet was released and returned to Chile. This legal challenge was a novel attempt to use legal process to challenge a decision before it was taken and could be seen as hard to reconcile with the <!--del_lnk--> rule of law, as it was predicated on a presumption that the Home Secretary had erred in law whatever the reasons were for the decision.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="2000s">2000s</span></h2>
       <p>After 2000, Amnesty International's agenda turned to the challenges arising from <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Globalization.htm" title="Globalisation">globalisation</a> and the reaction to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/September_11_attacks.htm" title="11 September 2001 attacks">11 September 2001 attacks</a> in the United States. The issue of globalisation provoked a major shift in Amnesty International policy, as the scope of its work was widened to include economic, social and cultural rights, an area that it had declined to work on in the past. Amnesty International felt this shift was important, not just to give credence to its principle of the indivisibility of rights, but because of what it saw as the growing power of companies and the undermining of many nation states as a result of globalisation.</p>
       <p>In the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, the new Amnesty International Secretary General, <!--del_lnk--> Irene Khan, reported that a senior government official had said to Amnesty International delegates: "Your role collapsed with the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York". In the years following the attacks, some believe that the gains made by human rights organisations over previous decades had possibly been eroded. Amnesty International argued that human rights were the basis for the security of all, not a barrier to it. Criticism came directly from the <!--del_lnk--> Bush administration and <i>The Washington Post</i>, when Khan, in 2005, likened the US government's detention facility at <!--del_lnk--> Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to a <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Gulag.</p>
       <p>During the first half of the new decade, Amnesty International turned its attention to <!--del_lnk--> violence against women, controls on the world <!--del_lnk--> arms trade, concerns surrounding the effectiveness of the UN, and ending torture. With its membership close to two million by 2005, Amnesty continued to work for prisoners of conscience.</p>
       <p>In 2007, AI's executive committee decided to support access to abortion "within reasonable gestational limits...for women in cases of rape, incest or violence, or where the pregnancy jeopardizes a mother&rsquo;s life or health".</p>
       <p>Amnesty International reported, concerning the <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq_War.htm" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>, on 17 March 2008, that despite claims the security situation in Iraq has improved in recent months, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human right">human rights</a> situation is disastrous, after the start of the war five years ago in 2003.</p>
       <p>In 2008 Amnesty International launched a <!--del_lnk--> mobile donating campaign in the United States, which allows supporters to make $5 <!--del_lnk--> micro-donations by sending a text message to the <!--del_lnk--> short code 90999 with the keyword RIGHTS. Amnesty International's mobile fund raising campaign was created in partnership with <!--del_lnk--> Mgive and the <!--del_lnk--> Mobile Giving Foundation.</p>
       <p>In 2009 Amnesty International accused Israel and the Palestinian Hamas movement of committing war crimes during Israel's January offensive in Gaza, called <!--del_lnk--> Operation Cast Lead, that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. The 117-page Amnesty report charged Israeli forces with killing hundreds of civilians and wanton destruction of thousands of homes. Amnesty found no evidence of Palestinian militants using human shields to stop Israeli attacks. A subsequent <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict was carried out; Amnesty stated that its findings were consistent with those of Amnesty's own field investigation, and called on the UN to act promptly to implement the mission's recommendations.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="2010s">2010s</span></h2>
       <p>In February 2010, <!--del_lnk--> Amnesty suspended <!--del_lnk--> Gita Sahgal, its gender unit head, after she criticised Amnesty for its links with <!--del_lnk--> Moazzam Begg, Director of a campaign group called <!--del_lnk--> Cageprisoners. She had called the links "a gross error of judgment" that risked Amnesty's reputation on human rights, and said it was wrong to ally with "Britain's most famous supporter of the Taliban". Amnesty responded that Sahgal was not suspended "for raising these issues internally... [Begg] speaks about his own views ..., not Amnesty International's." Among those who spoke up for Saghal were <!--del_lnk--> Salman Rushdie ("Amnesty ... has done its reputation incalculable damage.... It looks very much as if Amnesty's leadership is suffering from a kind of moral bankruptcy, and has lost the ability to distinguish right from wrong"), Member of Parliament <!--del_lnk--> Denis MacShane, <!--del_lnk--> Joan Smith, <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Hitchens, <!--del_lnk--> Martin Bright, <!--del_lnk--> Melanie Phillips, and <!--del_lnk--> Nick Cohen.</p>
       <p>In February 2011, Amnesty requested that Swiss authorities start a criminal investigation of former U.S. President <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> and arrest him.</p>
       <p>In July 2011, Amnesty International celebrated its 50 years with an animated short film directed by Carlos Lascano, produced by Eallin Motion Art and Dreamlife Studio, with music by Academy Award winner <!--del_lnk--> Hans Zimmer and nominee Lorne Balfe. The film shows that the fight for humanity is not yet over.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Principles">Principles</span></h2>
       <p>A vital part of AI's mandate is the so-called "violence clause". It sets <!--del_lnk--> prisoners of conscience apart from the other categories of prisoners on whose behalf the movement works. If a prisoner is serving a sentence imposed, after a fair trial, for activities involving violence, AI will not ask the government to release the prisoner.</p>
       <p>AI does not judge whether recourse to violence is justified or not. However, AI does not oppose the political use of violence in itself since <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights.htm" title="The Universal Declaration of Human Rights">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, in its preamble, foresees situations in which people could "be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression".</p>
       <p>AI neither supports nor condemns the resort to violence by political opposition groups in itself, just as AI neither supports nor condemns a government policy of using military force in fighting against armed opposition movements. However, AI supports minimum humane standards that should be respected by governments and armed opposition groups alike. When an opposition group tortures or kills its captives, takes hostages, or commits deliberate and arbitrary killings, AI condemns these abuses.</p>

       <p>Amnesty International primarily targets governments, but also reports on non-governmental bodies and private individuals ("<!--del_lnk--> non-state actors").</p>
       <p>There are six key areas which Amnesty deals with:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><a href="../../wp/w/Women%2527s_rights.htm" title="Women's rights">Women's</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Children%2527s_rights.htm" title="Children's rights">children's</a>, <!--del_lnk--> minorities' and <!--del_lnk--> indigenous rights</li>
        <li>Ending <!--del_lnk--> torture</li>
        <li>Abolition of the death penalty</li>
        <li>Rights of <!--del_lnk--> refugees</li>
        <li>Rights of <!--del_lnk--> prisoners of conscience</li>
        <li>Protection of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Human_dignity.htm" title="Human dignity">human dignity</a>.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Some specific aims are to: abolish the death penalty, end <!--del_lnk--> extra judicial executions and <!--del_lnk--> "disappearances," ensure prison conditions meet international human rights standards, ensure prompt and fair trial for all <!--del_lnk--> political prisoners, ensure free education to all children worldwide, decriminalise abortion, fight <!--del_lnk--> impunity from systems of justice, end the recruitment and use of <a href="../../wp/m/Military_use_of_children.htm" title="Military use of children">child soldiers</a>, free all <!--del_lnk--> prisoners of conscience, promote economic, social and cultural rights for marginalised communities, protect <!--del_lnk--> human rights defenders, promote <!--del_lnk--> religious tolerance, protect <!--del_lnk--> LGBT rights, stop <!--del_lnk--> torture and ill-treatment, stop unlawful killings in armed conflict, uphold the rights of <!--del_lnk--> refugees, <!--del_lnk--> migrants, and <!--del_lnk--> asylum seekers, and protect human dignity.</p>
       <p>To further these aims, Amnesty International has developed several techniques to publicise information and mobilise public opinion. The organisation considers as one of its strengths the publication of impartial and accurate reports. Reports are researched by: interviewing victims and officials, observing trials, working with local human rights activists, and monitoring the media. It aims to issue timely press releases and publishes information in newsletters and on web sites. It also sends official missions to countries to make courteous but insistent inquiries.</p>
       <p>Campaigns to mobilise public opinion can take the form of individual, country, or thematic campaigns. Many techniques are deployed, such as direct appeals (for example, letter writing), media and publicity work, and public demonstrations. Often, fund-raising is integrated with campaigning.</p>
       <p>In situations which require immediate attention, Amnesty International calls on existing urgent action networks or crisis response networks; for all other matters, it calls on its membership. It considers the large size of its human resources to be another of its key strengths.</p>
       <p>The role of Amnesty International has an immense impact on getting citizens onboard(sic) with focusing on human rights issues. These groups influence countries and governments to give their people justice with pressure and in man power. An example of Amnesty International's work, which began in the 1960s, is writing letters to free imprisoned people that were put there for non-violent expressions. The group now has power, attends sessions, and became a source of information for the U.N. The increase in participation of non-governmental organisations changes how we live today. Felix Dodds states in a recent document that, "In 1972 there were 39 democratic countries in the world; by 2002, there were 139." This shows that non-governmental organisations make enormous leaps within a short period of time for human rights.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Country_focus">Country focus</span></h3>
       <p>Amnesty reports disproportionately on relatively more democratic and open countries, arguing that its intention is not to produce a range of reports which statistically represents the world's human rights abuses, but rather to apply the pressure of public opinion to encourage improvements. The <!--del_lnk--> demonstration effect of the behaviour of both key Western governments and major non-Western states is an important factor: as one former Amnesty Secretary-General pointed out, "for many countries and a large number of people, the United States is a model," and according to one Amnesty manager, "large countries in&#xFB02;uence small countries." In addition, with the end of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, Amnesty felt that a greater emphasis on human rights in the North was needed to improve its credibility with its Southern critics by demonstrating its willingness to report on human rights issues in a truly global manner.</p>
       <p>According to one academic study, as a result of these considerations the frequency of Amnesty's reports is influenced by a number of factors, besides the frequency and severity of human rights abuses. For example, Amnesty reports significantly more (than predicted by human rights abuses) on more economically powerful states; and on countries which receive US military aid, on the basis that this Western complicity in abuses increases the likelihood of public pressure being able to make a difference. In addition, around 1993&ndash;94, Amnesty consciously developed its media relations, producing fewer background reports and more press releases, to increase the impact of its reports. Press releases are partly driven by news coverage, to use existing news coverage as leverage to discuss Amnesty's human rights concerns. This increases Amnesty's focus on the countries the media is more interested in.</p>
       <p>Despite these explanations, Amnesty has been vocal in regards to Israel. Amnesty, for example, helped popularize the concept of "Israeli apartheid" and spread the myth of the "Jenin massacre". In 2010, the head of Amnesty's Finnish branch, Frank Johansson, called Israel a "scum state," and in 2011 a top Amnesty UK official, Kristyan Benedict, said Israel, "along with Burma North Korea, Iran and Sudan," was one of the "stupid dictatorial regimes who abuse peoples&rsquo; basic universal rights."</p>
       <p>Amnesty's country focus is similar to that of some other comparable NGOs, notably <!--del_lnk--> Human Rights Watch: between 1991 and 2000, Amnesty and HRW shared eight of ten countries in their "top ten" (by Amnesty press releases; 7 for Amnesty reports). In addition, six of the 10 countries most reported on by Human Rights Watch in the 1990s also made <i><!--del_lnk--> The Economist's</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Newsweek's</i> "most covered" lists during that time.</p>

       <p>Amnesty International is largely made up of voluntary members, but retains a small number of paid professionals. In countries in which Amnesty International has a strong presence, members are organised as 'sections'. Sections coordinate basic Amnesty International activities normally with a significant number of members, some of whom will form into 'groups', and a professional staff. Each have a board of directors. In 2005 there were 52 sections worldwide. 'Structures' are aspiring sections. They also coordinate basic activities but have a smaller membership and a limited staff. In countries where no section or structure exists, people can become 'international members'. Two other organisational models exist: 'international networks', which promote specific themes or have a specific identity, and 'affiliated groups', which do the same work as section groups, but in isolation.</p>
       <p>The organisations outlined above are represented by the International Council (IC) which is led by the IC Chairperson. Members of sections and structures have the right to appoint one or more representatives to the Council according to the size of their membership. The IC may invite representatives from International Networks and other individuals to meetings, but only representatives from sections and structures have voting rights. The function of the IC is to appoint and hold accountable internal governing bodies and to determine the direction of the movement. The IC convenes every two years.</p>
       <p>The International Executive Committee (IEC), led by the IEC Chairperson, consists of eight members and the IEC Treasurer. It is elected by, and represents, the IC and meets biannually. The role of the IEC is to take decisions on behalf of Amnesty International, implement the strategy laid out by the IC, and ensure compliance with the organisation's statutes.</p>
       <p>The International Secretariat (IS) is responsible for the conduct and daily affairs of Amnesty International under direction from the IEC and IC. It is run by approximately 500 professional staff members and is headed by a Secretary General. The IS operates several work programmes; International Law and Organisations; Research; Campaigns; Mobilisation; and Communications. Its offices have been located in London since its establishment in the mid-1960s.</p>

       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Funding">Funding</span></h3>
       <p>Amnesty International is financed largely by fees and donations from its worldwide membership. It says that it does not accept donations from governments or governmental organisations. According to the AI website, "these personal and unaffiliated donations allow AI to maintain full independence from any and all governments, political ideologies, economic interests or religions. We neither seek nor accept any funds for human rights research from governments or political parties and we accept support only from businesses that have been carefully vetted. By way of ethical fundraising leading to donations from individuals, we are able to stand firm and unwavering in our defence of universal and indivisible human rights."</p>
       <p>However, AI did receive grants from the UK <!--del_lnk--> Department for International Development, the <!--del_lnk--> European Commission, the <!--del_lnk--> United States State Department. and other governments</p>
       <p>In November 2012, the Amnesty staff in London went on strike to protest work conditions and financial issues with the organisation. <!--del_lnk--> Gerald Steinberg, of <!--del_lnk--> NGO Monitor said, "They really are in trouble. They&rsquo;ve been in crisis for a number of years."</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Charitable_Status">Charitable Status</span></h3>
       <p>In the UK Amnesty International has two principal arms, Amnesty International UK and Amnesty International Charity Ltd. Both are UK-based organisations but only the latter is a charity.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>
       <p>Criticism of Amnesty International includes claims of excessive pay for management, underprotection of overseas staff, associating with organisations with a dubious record on human rights protection, <!--del_lnk--> selection bias, <!--del_lnk--> ideological/foreign policy bias against either non-<!--del_lnk--> Western countries or <!--del_lnk--> Western-supported countries, criticism of Amnesty's policies relating to abortion, and assertion that "defensive <!--del_lnk--> jihad" is not antithetical to human rights. Governments who have criticised Amnesty include those of <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>, Iran, <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, the <a href="../../wp/d/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo.htm" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, the People's Republic of China, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and the United States, for what they assert is one-sided reporting or a failure to treat threats to security as a mitigating factor. The actions of these governments&mdash;and of other governments critical of Amnesty International&mdash;have been the subject of human rights concerns voiced by Amnesty. As of February 2011, Amnesty is engaged in a dispute with the British union <!--del_lnk--> Unite over Amnesty allegedly attempting to de-recognize some of its foreign-based workers' rights.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Pay_controversy">Pay controversy</span></h3>
       <p>In February 2011, newspaper stories in the UK revealed that <!--del_lnk--> Irene Khan had received a payment of UK &pound;533,103 from Amnesty International following her resignation from the organisation on 31 December 2009, a fact pointed to from Amnesty's records for the 2009&ndash;2010 financial year. The sum paid to her was in excess of four times her annual salary of &pound;132,490. The deputy secretary general, <!--del_lnk--> Kate Gilmore &ndash; who also resigned in December 2009 &ndash; received an ex-gratia payment of &pound;320,000. <!--del_lnk--> Peter Pack, the chairman of Amnesty's international executive committee, initially stated on 19 February 2011, "The payments to outgoing secretary general Irene Khan shown in the accounts of AI (Amnesty International) Ltd for the year ending 31 March 2010 include payments made as part of a confidential agreement between AI Ltd and Irene Khan." and that "It is a term of this agreement that no further comment on it will be made by either party."</p>
       <p>The payment and AI's initial response to its leakage to the press led to considerable outcry. <!--del_lnk--> Philip Davies, the <a href="../../wp/c/Conservative_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> MP for <!--del_lnk--> Shipley, decried the payment, telling the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daily Express</i>, "I am sure people making donations to Amnesty, in the belief they are alleviating poverty, never dreamed they were subsidising a fat cat payout. This will disillusion many benefactors." On 21 February Peter Pack issued a further statement, in which he said that the payment was a "unique situation" that was "in the best interest of Amnesty's work" and that there would be no repetition of it. He stated that "the new secretary general, with the full support of the IEC, has initiated a process to review our employment policies and procedures to ensure that such a situation does not happen again." Pack also stated that Amnesty was "fully committed to applying all the resources that we receive from our millions of supporters to the fight for human rights". On 25 February, Pack issued a more complete statement intended for internal circulation among Amnesty members and staff. This in turn was been made public by Amnesty International Netherlands and Amnesty International Canada. In summary, it states that Amnesty's International Executive Committee (IEC) in 2008 had decided not to prolong Khan's contract for a third term. In the following months, IEC discovered that due to British employment law, it had to choose between the three options of either offering Khan a third term, discontinuing her post and potentially risking legal consequences, or signing a confidential agreement and issuing a pay compensation.</p>
