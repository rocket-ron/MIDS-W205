<h2><img class="image-left image-inline" src="../../wp/i/_GPImage_preview" alt="Rebuilding houses post tsunami Sri Lanka" />SOS TSUNAMI RELIEF WORK IN SRI LANKA</h2>
<p>One year on 28 Dec 2005.</p>
<p>Southern and Eastern Sri
Lanka were very badly hit by the waves last Christmas. SOS Children was
the first aid organisation to reach many of the affected people. We are
still supporting these people today and will continue to do so for
years to come. SOS Children has so far rebuilt 1,014 houses, with the
first homes handed over in June this year. When we rebuild villages, we
also restore the infrastructure: electricity, water and sewerage
facilities.</p>
<p>Over 7,000 children in Sri Lanka are benefiting
from the SOS Family Strengthening Programmes, which offer health
check-ups, <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Medical_Centres.htm">medicines, and day care</a>. In Iraalodai, on the East coast, we
provided 128 families who lost their livelihoods with start-up grants
to help them rebuild their lives and be independent once more.</p>
<p>Many
children were <a title="Emergency Relief Archive: look back at the Asian Tsunami" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/2/2004_Asian_Tsunami.htm">orphaned by the tsunami</a>, and we are constructing a new
SOS Children&#x2019;s Village to provide a loving home for 120 children. Youth
homes will be built in five years&#x2019; time, to accommodate the children as
they grow older. A location for the Children&#x2019;s Village is currently
being finalised and the first children will move into their new home in
2007. An SOS Social Centre will be located near the village, which will
provide health advice and counselling to people from the local
community.</p>
<p>Over 2,340 families every year will benefit from the
10 <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Medical_Centres.htm">SOS Medical Centres</a> that will be built in <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka_A.htm">Sri Lanka</a>, meaning that
children and parents will be healthier. Six SOS Adult Training Centres,
which will give skills education to 150 people, will help the region&#x2019;s
economy grow again.</p>
<h3>How children in Sri Lanka come to terms with their traumatic experiences</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It
is actually difficult to imagine what coping strategies children need
to overcome the shock of the tsunami disaster. A first-hand account by
local SOS volunteers, teachers and educational experts in Komari, on
the East coast of Sri Lanka, illustrates this meticulous process.</p>
<p>In
view of the urgent need to provide children with psychological support
following the tsunami disaster, SOS Children established activity
centres offering various programmes aimed at trauma relief in the small
village of Komari. Classes were also arranged, as the children would
have otherwise gone for months without any schooling. Both the parents
and children were very shocked after their experiences on 26 December
2004, and constantly feared another tsunami. Since the school is close
to the sea and relatively far from their homes, parents did not wish to
send children to school, as they would be "out of reach". The activity
centres met both their therapeutic and educational needs.</p>
<p>In
order to give the children a feeling of stability, order and safety in
the midst of chaos, local volunteers regularly taught and ran activity
programmes for <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Schools.htm">primary school children </a>in the mornings, and in the
afternoons, other age groups were taught. Volunteers from other
organisations also assisted severely traumatised children at the SOS
Centres. The local SOS volunteers said that the children could not be
approached at all in the beginning, "They had images in their minds
that they could not place, not even in their wildest dreams."</p>
<p>One
of the first therapeutic measures was to have them paint pictures. The
children used dark, aggressive colours, such as red, dark green and
black. The pictures were of people, land and trees, all under water. In
the beginning they only went to the lessons sporadically, and it took a
long time for signs of healing to be visible. Some children spoke about
what they had experienced, but most would not talk to the helpers; some
could not even look them in the eyes.</p>
<p>There were moments when
the children did not react to questions being asked and could not
concentrate: "They would just be gone, lost in their thoughts",
explains one of the staff about the difficult first phase. The local
SOS volunteers needed support themselves in order to cope with the
situation and to show the children a way out of their inner paralysis.
Experts helped them and through time, the children began to regain
their trust. They started speaking more openly, showed their pictures,
and it was possible to converse with them. Cheerfully-coloured toys
helped them improve their concentration, and theatrical and interactive
games were used to make contact with children who could or would not
speak. Children who had extremely difficult situations to recover from
were counselled individually. This work was mentally very demanding for
the volunteers and staff. But after considerable efforts, it has been
possible to ease the children&#x2019;s trauma and most of them now attend
class regularly.</p>
<p>Are the children able to look at the sea
impartially almost a year after the disaster? "Not always, because they
know that the ocean can create absolute chaos, and repeated tsunami
alarms bring back all the memories", says an employee of SOS Children's
Villages in Sri Lanka. "But these children are also witness to and are
affected by an ethnic war which has marked their lives for years. You
can see them playing on the beach and going to class again now; they
try to adapt their daily lives to the changes over which they have no
control."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Interview with Cedric de Silva, director of SOS Children's Villages Sri Lanka</h3>
<p>Cedric
de Silva, director of SOS Children in Sri Lanka, talks about
the first days after 26 December 2004, about the challenges and
obstacles in the rebuilding process, about personal experiences and the
long way back to normality.</p>
<p><strong><em>How did SOS Children's Villages Sri Lanka first tackle the tsunami and how has the work developed since December last year?</em></strong><br />SOS
got into action very early on. We were lucky that we already had a base
on the East coast, the social centre in Morakkatanchenai, north of
Batticaloa. In fact SOS was the first NGO to start working in the area
after the tsunami hit. Even after the initial devastation, the rain and
floods caused considerable additional damage and many more people had
to leave their homes. To house these people, we were able to use the
kindergarten in Morakkatanchenai as a refugee centre. From this point
on, our main focus was on the East.</p>
<p>Although there were no SOS
coordinators in the area, the trained kindergarten teachers and a local
priest were able to use existing facilities to mobilise volunteers and
organise relief efforts. We also worked together with a team of Korean
doctors, setting up a tent for the day to provide medical assistance
for the surrounding villages.<br />Even before the tsunami struck, the
small town of Komari, south of Batticaloa, had been chosen as the site
for an additional social centre. It was therefore logical that SOS
should offer special help in Komari and refugee camps were set up and
basic emergency supplies were distributed here and in the surrounding
areas. After the initial relief work, start-up grants were handed out,
just as in the other areas where SOS was working, helping to establish
the organisation and its work.<br />Medical staff and vehicles from SOS
Children's Village Piliyandala provided assistance to inaccessible
areas in the South. Here, emergency supplies we received from overseas,
for example the donation of refrigerators from the Austrian government,
were channelled through the Sri Lankan government to children's
hospitals.<br />As a reaction to the tsunami, the Sri Lankan government
introduced a law to create a 'buffer zone', which meant that no
construction work could be undertaken within 200m of the sea in the
East and 100m in the South. All current inhabitants of this zone had to
be relocated and unfortunately the government took some time in finding
alternative sites for the reconstruction of homes.<br />So, SOS has
focused its efforts on rebuilding homes of those people already living
outside the buffer zone. In fact, 20 houses have so far been rebuilt
(in only 100 days) and another 16 or 17 repaired and handed over to the
owners. The new houses are prefabs - a shell is put in place on the
foundations and filled with concrete. Once the concrete has set, the
roof can be added. In all a house can be built in a couple of days.
Construction has now also started on the relocation sites.</p>
<p><strong><em>What was your personal experience during the first few days after the tsunami?</em></strong><br />Just
incredible shock. It was just awesome the kind of destruction it had
created. There are no words to describe what was there. It was just
absolute wipe out. You can't imagine the power of that water.<br />Fortunately
it was not just one big wave. The water drew back and exposed the
reefs. Some people went to have a closer look; others ran away, fearing
something strange was happening. Then the water surged forwards. This
all happened a few times before the biggest waves broke. It was almost
a warning. We were also lucky that it happened in the morning. If it
had been during the night many, many more would have been killed.</p>
<p><strong><em>What were the main difficulties you experienced in the period immediately after the disaster?</em></strong><br />Surprisingly,
the logistics were not too difficult. Some roads were washed away, but
there were always different routes we could take. The main problem was
getting around the government's bureaucracies. Everything took a great
deal of time, but having said that, we were in a more fortunate
position than most, as the Minister of Social Services is a close
contact of SOS and supported us whenever and wherever she could. SOS
was the first NGO to sign a Memorandum of Understanding for the
rebuilding of a village (Komari) with the government. We also have good
contact with the Minister for Muslim Affairs, which has also helped us
considerably with our work in the East. We experienced no real problems
with the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) either. It was only in
Iraalodai where problems surfaced. We had signed an MOU with the
government regarding the rebuilding of the village (Iraalodai), but
another organisation felt that Iraalodai should have been handed over
to their guardianship, as they had been working in this area for a
couple of years. As the village is within the LTTE area, the
organisation complained to the LTTE, who reversed the government's
decision and handed responsibility of rebuilding Iraalodai to them. Of
course we respected the decision, but it seems that very little
rebuilding work has so far been done in the village, which is a shame
for the local people there.</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you have any figures on the number of children orphaned as a result of the tsunami?</em></strong><br />Unfortunately
not. Accurate figures on orphans are simply not available. The Sri
Lankan government has followed UNICEF's policy that children should be
cared for by members of their extended family, rather than placed in
any type of care establishment. I tried to explain to both the
government and UNICEF that SOS is not an institution, but offers
children family-based care, but their policy would not allow for this.
Instead, families receive 500 Rupees (roughly $5) a month to look after
the child. This is nothing. Many families will just waste this money.<br />In
many cases the children will be neglected and abused. We could easily
see young girls, orphaned as a result of the tsunami, wandering around
with their own children in a year or so. Unless you're going to monitor
such a policy, who's going to see what kind of care is meted out? This
all means that the statistics on children are very disparate. We don't
know which statistics to believe. SOS Children's Villages has not
worked with any tsunami orphans at all because of this government
policy, which says that it is illegal for any person or organisation to
harbour these children. But perhaps in time, once they realise how
these children are being treated, SOS will be allowed to care for some
of these kids.</p>
<p><em><strong>Did you form many partnerships with other NGOs?</strong></em><br />We
worked very closely with an excellent organisation called Spokane Fire
Fighters. The organisation originally comes from Washington State, USA,
although there were also some Australians and Brits in the team. They
were doing great work in Komari rebuilding schools and cleaning out
wells. We're now investigating the possibility of creating tube wells
in the area.<br />Generally we carried out work on our own, but we are
always happy to cooperate with other organisations if it is of benefit
to the people.</p>
<p><em><strong>Have you had many conflicts with other NGOs?</strong></em><br />Apart from the difference in opinion on policy with UNICEF and the problem in Iraalodai, we've had no real conflicts with NGOs.</p>
<p><strong><em>How is SOS Children's Villages perceived following its tsunami efforts?</em></strong><br />We
have gained considerable recognition for our work and the quality of
our work, in particular our rebuilding of houses. SOS is one of the few
NGOs that has maintained its presence in the affected areas in the East
and this has earned us respect.</p>
<p><strong><em>How long will it take before everything is back to normal?</em></strong><br />What
is &#x2018;normal&#x2019; in that sense?! If it means that all the damaged buildings
are cleared and there is no evidence of the tsunami then it may take
several years. I don't know. But &#x2018;normal&#x2019; in the sense of regaining
livelihoods and getting people back into their homes, then it should be
within the next year.<br />Right now, most people are back to living
their &#x2018;normal&#x2019; lives, but are doing it living in tents. Some
beneficiaries, though, are now living a more comfortable life thanks to
support from donors and NGOs. Before the tsunami they lived in very
basic huts and now they have solid buildings, water, schools&#x2026; This is
quite different to what was 'normal' for them, but still, they seem to
have taken the aid for granted.<br />The effects of the tsunami are still
very evident and there have been several false alarms - 4 or 5 in
Komari alone. Everyone flees and runs for cover. The first false alarm
was a couple of weeks after the tsunami. I heard about the earthquake
in Indonesia on the news and called our base office near Komari to warn
them. It was during the night, but they evacuated all the homes along
the coast just in case. Since then, whenever anyone hears about
tremors, especially in Indonesia, people start to run. But generally,
people have overcome their fear of the sea and can get on with their
fishing as they did before, which is an important source of income for
many of the coastal inhabitants.</p>
<p><strong><em>Have the emergency relief efforts had any long-term effects on any of the existing SOS Children's Villages?</em></strong><br />The
village at Monaragala was used as a base for work in the East early on,
but neither it nor any of the other villages have been affected
long-term.</p>
<p><strong><em>How will the new community centres and <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Medical_Centres.htm">SOS Social Centres</a> benefit the communities?</em></strong><br />The
new social centres are designed to act as tsunami protection centres as
well. They're being built on columns, so that the main part of the
building is on the first floor, with a basically open ground floor.
This means that should another tsunami strike, the water will simply
flow underneath the building, leaving it standing. There are also
grills around the outside, so that people can climb up into the safety
of the first floor. The open ground floor can be used as a class room
or for meetings, and the main part of the building will house the
medical centre etc. A family strengthening programme will also be
affiliated to each of these new social/tsunami protection centres. This
all means that SOS Children's Villages' work has erupted into areas we
would never have dreamt of reaching.<br />Two social centres will be
built in the South. One is situated slightly inland and is already in
the process of being built. Another is at the design stage. Suitable
sites for four centres on the East coast have been located and final
negotiations are underway with the land-owners. In all a total of ten
multipurpose community centres and social centres are planned, so we
still have to find four more suitable locations. [Eight multi-purpose
community centres which will be operated by the communities themselves
and two SOS Social Centres will be built]</p>
<p><strong><em>And the new SOS Children's Village - where will that be built?</em></strong><br />It
won't be in Batticaloa. No way! Batticaloa is right in the middle of a
conflict area and I don't want to put the children, mothers or
co-workers at risk. A village could be taken over by the government
army or the Tamil Tigers at any time. I want to find some land further
south of Batticaloa, but it's quite difficult politically and
geographically. Politically it's difficult because of the on-going
disputes between the government and the LTTE and geographically because
of the government buffer zone and the lagoons and waterways that run
along the coast just a few kilometres inland.</p>
<p><strong><em>How has SOS Children's Villages Sri Lanka coped with the enormous increase in workload?</em></strong><br />You
might be surprised to hear, but SOS Sri Lanka only employed the
additional services of one person, two pick up trucks and maybe 2 or 3
bikes. It's incredible, especially compared to UNICEF and the other UN
organisations. The Red Cross is one of the few international
organisations to have been active and efficient, in particular with
their water purification work. Apart from the one new employee, we also
recruited about ten young educated locals in Komari and Kayankerni to
help us assess the needs of the beneficiaries. One other girl, who is
studying in the USA, also helped on a voluntary basis, working with the
traumatised children.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you see the future of SOS Children's Villages Sri Lanka?</em></strong><br />The
future of SOS in Sri Lanka was never in any doubt, but the tsunami work
has meant there has been enormous growth in terms of facilities in
