       <p><b>Andrew Barron "Andy" Murray</b>, <small style="font-size:85%;"><!--del_lnk--> OBE</small> (born 15 May 1987) is a <!--del_lnk--> Scottish professional tennis player, ranked World No. 2 and <!--del_lnk--> British No. 1. He achieved a top-10 ranking by the <!--del_lnk--> ATP for the first time on 16 April 2007, and reached a career peak of World No. 2 in August 2009, then again in April/May 2013. He is the holder of both the <a href="../../wp/u/US_Open_%2528tennis%2529.htm" title="US Open (tennis)">US Open</a> and the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Championships%252C_Wimbledon.htm" title="The Championships, Wimbledon">Wimbledon Championships</a>, and is the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 Olympic tennis men's singles champion.</p>
       <p>At the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 US Open, Murray became the first British player since 1977, and the first British man since 1936, to win a <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Slam_%2528tennis%2529.htm" title="Grand Slam (tennis)">Grand Slam</a> singles tournament, when he defeated <!--del_lnk--> Novak Djokovic in five sets. This title makes him the only British male to become a Grand Slam singles champion during the <!--del_lnk--> Open Era. On 7 July 2013, Murray won the <!--del_lnk--> 2013 Wimbledon Championships, becoming the first British man to do so since <a href="../../wp/f/Fred_Perry.htm" title="Fred Perry">Fred Perry</a>, <!--del_lnk--> 77 years previously. He again beat Djokovic in the final, this time in straight sets.</p>
       <p>At the <a href="../../wp/2/2012_Summer_Olympics.htm" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Olympic Games</a>, four weeks after losing his first Wimbledon final to <a href="../../wp/r/Roger_Federer.htm" title="Roger Federer">Roger Federer</a>, Murray defeated Federer in straight sets to win the gold medal in <!--del_lnk--> 2012 men's singles, becoming the first British champion in over 100 years. He also won a silver medal in <!--del_lnk--> 2012 mixed doubles, playing with <!--del_lnk--> Laura Robson.</p>
       <p>He has been the runner-up in five other singles Grand Slam finals: the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 US Open, the <!--del_lnk--> 2010 Australian Open, the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Australian Open, <!--del_lnk--> 2012 Wimbledon and the <!--del_lnk--> 2013 Australian Open, losing three to <a href="../../wp/r/Roger_Federer.htm" title="Roger Federer">Roger Federer</a> and two to <!--del_lnk--> Novak Djokovic. In 2011, Murray became only the seventh player in the Open Era to reach the semi-finals of all four Grand Slam tournaments in one year. His current coach is <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Lendl.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
       <p>Murray was born to William and <!--del_lnk--> Judith Murray in Glasgow, Scotland. His maternal grandfather, <!--del_lnk--> Roy Erskine, was a professional <a href="../../wp/a/Association_football.htm" title="Association football">footballer</a> in the late 1950s. Murray's brother, <!--del_lnk--> Jamie, is also a professional tennis player, playing on the doubles circuit. Murray attended <!--del_lnk--> Dunblane Primary School, and was present during the 1996 <!--del_lnk--> Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 17 people before shooting himself. Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says he was too young to understand what was happening and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography <i>Hitting Back</i> he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car.</p>
       <p>Murray later attended <!--del_lnk--> Dunblane High School. At 15, he was asked to train with <a href="../../wp/r/Rangers_F.C..htm" title="Rangers F.C.">Rangers Football Club</a> at their School of Excellence, but declined, opting to focus on his tennis career instead. He then decided to move to <a href="../../wp/b/Barcelona.htm" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, Spain. There he studied at the <!--del_lnk--> Schiller International School and trained on the clay courts of the S&aacute;nchez-Casal Academy. Murray described this time as "a big sacrifice". While in Spain, he trained with <!--del_lnk--> Emilio S&aacute;nchez, formerly the world no. 1 doubles player.</p>
       <p>Murray was born with a bipartite <!--del_lnk--> patella, where the kneecap remains as two separate bones instead of fusing together in early childhood. He was diagnosed at the age of 16 and is seen frequently to hold his knee due to the pain caused by the condition and has pulled out of events because of it.</p>
       <p>Since 2006 Murray has been in a relationship with Kim Sears, who is regularly seen attending his matches.</p>
       <p>In February 2013, Murray bought <!--del_lnk--> Cromlix House for &pound;1.8 million with plans to turn it into a 15-room five-star hotel set to open in 2014.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Junior_tennis">Junior tennis</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Leon Smith, Murray's tennis coach from 11 to 17, described Murray as "unbelievably competitive", while Murray attributes his abilities to the motivation gained from losing to his older brother Jamie. At the age of 12, Murray won his age group at the Orange Bowl, a prestigious event for junior players.</p>
       <p>In July 2003, Murray started out on the Challenger and Futures circuit. In his first tournament, he reached the <!--del_lnk--> quarterfinals of the Manchester challenger. In September, Murray won his first senior title by taking the <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> Futures event. He also reached the semi-finals of the Edinburgh Futures event. In July 2004 Murray played a Challenger event in <a href="../../wp/n/Nottingham.htm" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>, where he lost to future <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Slam_%2528tennis%2529.htm" title="Grand Slam (tennis)">Grand Slam</a> finalist <!--del_lnk--> Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round. Murray then went on to win events in <!--del_lnk--> X&agrave;tiva and Rome.</p>
       <p>In September 2004, he won the Junior <a href="../../wp/u/US_Open_%2528tennis%2529.htm" title="US Open (tennis)">US Open</a> and was selected for the <a href="../../wp/d/Davis_Cup.htm" title="Davis Cup">Davis Cup</a> match against Austria later that month; however, he was not selected to play. Later that year, he won <!--del_lnk--> BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year.</p>
       <p>As a junior Murray reached as high as No. 6 in the world in 2003 (and No. 8 in doubles). In the 2004-instated combined rankings, Murray reached No. 2 in the world.</p>

       <p>Murray began 2005 ranked 407 in the world and in March, he became the youngest Briton to play in the <a href="../../wp/d/Davis_Cup.htm" title="Davis Cup">Davis Cup</a>. Murray turned professional in April and was given a <!--del_lnk--> wild card entry to a clay-court tournament in <a href="../../wp/b/Barcelona.htm" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Open SEAT, where he lost in three sets to <!--del_lnk--> Jan Hernych. Murray then reached the semi-finals of the boys' French Open where he lost in straight sets to <!--del_lnk--> Marin &#x10C;ili&#x107;. Given a wild card to <!--del_lnk--> Queen's, Murray progressed past <!--del_lnk--> Santiago Ventura in straight sets for his first ATP match win. After a second round win he played former Australian Open champion <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Johansson in the third round, losing in three sets. Following his performance at Queen's, Murray received a wild card for <a href="../../wp/t/The_Championships%252C_Wimbledon.htm" title="The Championships, Wimbledon">Wimbledon</a>. Ranked 312, Murray became the first Scot in the <!--del_lnk--> Open Era to reach the third round of the men's singles tournament at Wimbledon.

He followed this up with straight set victories over <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o Sousa, practice partner <!--del_lnk--> Ri&#x10D;ardas Berankis and French No. 14 seed <!--del_lnk--> Gilles Simon. In the quarterfinals he cruised past <!--del_lnk--> J&eacute;r&eacute;my Chardy in straight sets to set up a semi final clash with <a href="../../wp/r/Roger_Federer.htm" title="Roger Federer">Roger Federer</a>. After exchanging sets, Murray eventually prevailed in 5 sets, recording his first Grand Slam tournament triumph over Federer. With this victory, each member of the ATP's most dominant quartet of the previous four years (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray) had beaten the other three at the Majors. This victory set up Murray's third consecutive Major final appearance, and second in a row against <!--del_lnk--> Novak Djokovic. After taking the first set in a tiebreak, Murray was eventually defeated in four sets. His defeat in this final meant that Murray became only the second man in the Open Era to achieve 3 runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, the other being <a href="../../wp/s/Stefan_Edberg.htm" title="Stefan Edberg">Stefan Edberg</a>.</p>
       <p>At the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Murray lost at the quarter-final stage to <!--del_lnk--> Juan Mart&iacute;n del Potro in three sets. At the <!--del_lnk--> Miami Masters, Murray made it through his first four matches without dropping a set, and after overcoming <!--del_lnk--> Richard Gasquet in the semifinals, faced <!--del_lnk--> David Ferrer in the final. After losing the first set, and facing match point in the decider at 5&ndash;6, the Scot eventually took the match in a third set tiebreaker to win his second Miami Masters title, and leapfrog Roger Federer into second place in the rankings, ending a near-decade long time period in which either Federer or Rafael Nadal were ranked in the top two. Murray briefly returned to number 3 in the world, following a third round defeat to <!--del_lnk--> Stanislas Wawrinka in <!--del_lnk--> Monte-Carlo, however reclaimed the number 2 ranking as a result of Federer failing to defend his title at the <!--del_lnk--> Mutua Madrid Open. Later, Murray lost at the quarter-final stage to <!--del_lnk--> Tom&aacute;&scaron; Berdych in straight sets. On 15 May 2013 at the <!--del_lnk--> Rome Masters, Murray retired due to a hip injury during his second round match against <!--del_lnk--> Marcel Granollers on his 26th birthday. Murray had just battled back to tie the match at one set all after winning the second set on a tiebreak. This left Murray with only eleven days to be fit for the start of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Open.htm" title="2013 French Open">French Open</a>.</p>
       <p>Speaking at a press conference after the match, Murray said, "As it is, I'd be very surprised if I was playing in Paris. I need to make a plan as to what I do. I'll chat with the guys tonight and make a plan for the next few days then make a decision on Paris after the next five days." He would go on to withdraw from Roland Garros later, citing back injury. After a four-week break due to injury, Murray made his comeback at the <!--del_lnk--> 2013 Aegon Championships, where he was the top seed. After a rain delayed first day, Murray had to complete his second round match against <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas Mahut, and his subsequent match against <!--del_lnk--> Marinko Matosevic on the same day, both of which he won in straight sets. After beating <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Becker in the quarterfinals, Murray next faced his first top ten opponent since losing to <!--del_lnk--> Tomas Berdych in Madrid, taking on <!--del_lnk--> Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals. After dropping the first set against the Frenchman, Murray eventually raised his level and won in three to set up a final against <!--del_lnk--> Marin &#x10C;ili&#x107; of Croatia, his third consecutive final on grass courts. He came from behind again to beat &#x10C;ili&#x107; in three sets to claim his third title at <!--del_lnk--> Queen's Club.</p>
       <p>Going into Wimbledon, Murray hadn't lost a match on grass since the previous year's final, and was on a winning streak of 11 matches on grass. In the first two rounds, Murray faced <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Becker and <!--del_lnk--> Yen-hsun Lu respectively, defeating both in straight sets. His third round match was against 32nd seed <!--del_lnk--> Tommy Robredo, and despite a tour comeback over the past year, Murray overcame the Spaniard in straight sets to set up a clash with <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Youzhny, the highest seed left in Murray's half following the unexpectedly early exits of <a href="../../wp/r/Roger_Federer.htm" title="Roger Federer">Roger Federer</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Rafael_Nadal.htm" title="Rafael Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a>. Despite facing a fightback in the second set, Murray won in straight sets to make it through to his tenth consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, in which he was to play <!--del_lnk--> Fernando Verdasco, the first left-handed player Murray had faced since the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 US Open. For the seventh time in his career, Murray had to come back from a deficit of two sets to ultimately come through in five, setting up a semifinal clash with 24th seed <!--del_lnk--> Jerzy Janowicz, the Polish player who beat Murray in their previous encounter. After Murray failed to break Janowicz's serve, the Pole took the opening set in the tiebreak, following a double fault from Murray. The Scot however managed to up his level of play, and won the next three sets, making it through to his second consecutive Wimbledon final, and third consecutive major final against <!--del_lnk--> Novak Djokovic.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Despite the Serb being the favourite to win the title throughout the Championships, Murray overcame Djokovic in a straight sets match that lasted over three hours, to become the first British winner of the men's singles title since <a href="../../wp/f/Fred_Perry.htm" title="Fred Perry">Fred Perry</a> in 1936, the first <!--del_lnk--> Scot of either sex to win a Wimbledon singles title since <!--del_lnk--> Harold Mahoney in 1896, and to extend his winning streak on grass to 18 matches. With the win, he also became only the second man in the open era after <a href="../../wp/r/Rafael_Nadal.htm" title="Rafael Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> to hold the Olympic singles gold medal and Wimbledon title simultaneously.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Murray_vs._Djokovic">Murray vs. Djokovic</span></h3>
       <p>Djokovic and Andy Murray have met 19 times with Djokovic leading 11&ndash;8. Djokovic leads 2&ndash;0 on clay, 9&ndash;6 on hard courts, and Murray leads 2&ndash;0 on grass. The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being only a week older than Djokovic. They went to training camp together, and Murray won the first match they ever played as teenagers. The pair have met 9 times in finals, with Murray leading the series 5&ndash;4. Five of the finals were at ATP Masters 1000 events, with Murray winning the first three in straight sets, but Djokovic defeated Murray in the most recent 2 finals: first in straight sets, second in three sets. They have met in four Major Finals: The 2011 Australian Open, the 2012 US Open, the 2013 Australian Open and the 2013 Wimbledon Championships. Djokovic has won in Australia twice, and Murray emerged as the victor at the US Open and Wimbledon.</p>
       <p>They also played a nearly five-hour long semifinal match in the 2012 Australian Open, which Djokovic won 7&ndash;5 in the fifth set after Murray led 2 sets to 1. Murray and Djokovic met again in 2012 at the London 2012 Olympic Games, with Murray winning in straight sets. Djokovic won their three most recent meetings, including a three set thriller at the final of the Shanghai Masters, in which Murray held five match point opportunities in the second set, however Djokovic saved each of them, forcing a deciding set. He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title, ending Murray's 12&ndash;0 winning streak at the event. The three set thrillers they played in <!--del_lnk--> Rome and <!--del_lnk--> Shanghai in <!--del_lnk--> 2011 and <!--del_lnk--> 2012 respectively were voted the ATP World Tour Match of the Year for each respective season. Many see this as the emerging rivalry, as the two are both in their prime years, and are both likely to be playing for at least another 5 years. Murray ranks world number two behind Djokovic, with the latter having a wide lead. After defeating Djokovic to claim the 2013 Wimbledon title, Murray stated that "That last game pretty much took everything out of me. I worked so hard in that last game. They will be the hardest few points I have to play in my life. Some of the shots he came up with were unbelievable."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Murray_vs._Federer">Murray vs. Federer</span></h3>
       <p>Murray and <a href="../../wp/r/Roger_Federer.htm" title="Roger Federer">Roger Federer</a> have met 20 times, with the series led 11&ndash;9 by Murray. Murray leads 10&ndash;8 on hard courts, they are tied 1&ndash;1 on grass. They have never met on clay. Federer won the first professional match they played, however since 2006, Federer has failed to regain the lead over Murray. Federer leads 5&ndash;3 in finals, having won each of their Grand Slam Final meetings at the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open, both of which Federer won in straight sets, and the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, where Murray took the first set, but ended up losing in 4 sets. Murray leads 6&ndash;1 in ATP 1000 tournaments and 2&ndash;0 in finals. They have met four times at the ATP World Tour Finals, with Murray winning in Shanghai in 2008 and Federer coming out victorious in London in 2009, 2010 and in 2012. In August 2012, Murray beat Federer in the <!--del_lnk--> final of the London 2012 Olympics to win the gold medal, denying Federer a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Grand_Slam_%2528tennis%2529.htm" title="Career Golden Slam">Career Golden Slam</a>. In 2013 Murray beat Federer for the first time in a Major in the semi-finals of the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Open, prevailing in five sets.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Murray_vs._Nadal">Murray vs. Nadal</span></h3>
       <p>Murray has played against <a href="../../wp/r/Rafael_Nadal.htm" title="Rafael Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> on 18 occasions since <!--del_lnk--> 2007, with Nadal leading 13&ndash;5.

Murray lost three consecutive Grand Slam semi-finals to Nadal in 2011 from the <!--del_lnk--> French Open to the <!--del_lnk--> US Open. Of the past 19 Grand Slam drawsheets, they have been drawn in the same half 16 times.

       </div>
       <p>Professional tennis coach <!--del_lnk--> Paul Annacone stated that Murray "may be the best counterpuncher on tour today." His strengths include groundstrokes with low error rate, the ability to anticipate and react, and his transition from defence to offence with speed, which enables him to hit winners from defensive positions. His playing style has been likened to that of <!--del_lnk--> Miloslav Me&#x10D;&iacute;&#x159;. Murray also has one of the best two-backhands on the tour, which is explosive and a dynamic stroke execution.</p>
       <p>Murray's tactics usually involve passive exchanges from the baseline. He is capable of injecting sudden pace to his groundstrokes to surprise his opponents who are used to the slow rally. Murray is also one of the top returners in the game, often able to block back fast serves with his excellent reach and ability to anticipate. For this reason, Murray is rarely aced. Murray is known for being one of the most intelligent tacticians on the court, often constructing points. Murray is most proficient on a fast surface (such as <!--del_lnk--> hard courts), although he has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game. <a href="../../wp/t/Tim_Henman.htm" title="Tim Henman">Tim Henman</a> has stated that Murray may now have the best lob in the game, succeeding <!--del_lnk--> Lleyton Hewitt.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Endorsements_and_equipment">Endorsements and equipment</span></h2>
       <p>Murray wears <!--del_lnk--> Adidas sportswear; in 2009 he was signed up for a five-year-deal worth &pound;30 million. This includes wearing their range of tennis shoes. The contract with Adidas allowed Murray to keep his shirt sleeve sponsors <!--del_lnk--> Shiatzy Chen, <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bank of Scotland and <!--del_lnk--> Highland Spring. Before he was signed by Adidas in late 2009, he wore <a href="../../wp/f/Fred_Perry.htm#Clothing_label" title="Fred Perry">Fred Perry</a> apparel. Murray uses <!--del_lnk--> Head rackets.</p>
       <p>In June 2012, the Swiss watch manufacturer <!--del_lnk--> Rado announced that Murray had signed a deal to wear their D-Star 200 model.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Charitable_work">Charitable work</span></h2>
       <p>Murray is a founding member of the <!--del_lnk--> Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with <a href="../../wp/d/David_Beckham.htm" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a>. Footage from the launch at Wembley Stadium can be seen on YouTube and <!--del_lnk--> the charity's website. Murray also made 'Nets Needed', a short public service announcement, for the charity to help raise awareness and funds to help in the fight against malaria. Murray has also taken part in several charity tennis events, including the <!--del_lnk--> Rally for Relief events that took place prior to the start of the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Australian Open.</p>
       <p>In June 2013, Murray teamed up with former British number 1 <a href="../../wp/t/Tim_Henman.htm" title="Tim Henman">Tim Henman</a> for a charity doubles match against Murray's coach and eight-time grand slam champion <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Lendl, and world no. 6 <!--del_lnk--> Tom&aacute;&scaron; Berdych at the <!--del_lnk--> Queen's Club in London. The event named <!--del_lnk--> Rally Against Cancer was organised to raise money for Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, following the diagnosis of fellow Brit <!--del_lnk--> Ross Hutchins with <!--del_lnk--> Hodgkins Lymphoma. The event took place following the final day of competitive play at the <!--del_lnk--> AEGON Championships, on Sunday 16 June. Subsequently, following his victory at the tournament, Murray donated his entire prize money pot of around &euro;80,000 to <!--del_lnk--> The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.</p>

       <p>Murray identifies himself as <!--del_lnk--> Scottish and <!--del_lnk--> British. Prior to <!--del_lnk--> Wimbledon 2006, Murray caused some public debate when he was quoted as saying he would "support anyone but <a href="../../wp/e/England_national_football_team.htm" title="England national football team">England</a>" at the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 World Cup. English ex-tennis player <a href="../../wp/t/Tim_Henman.htm" title="Tim Henman">Tim Henman</a> confirmed that the remarks had been made in jest and were only in response to Murray being teased by journalist Des Kelly and Henman. While in <!--del_lnk--> Wimbledon 2013 during his winning post-match interview, he referred himself as a 'British winner'.</p>
       <p>Regarding the <!--del_lnk--> 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Murray has stated that, "I will think about it, speak to some people and try to see what is best for the country."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other">Other</span></h3>
       <p>In 2006, there was uproar after a match with <!--del_lnk--> Kenneth Carlsen. Having been given a warning for racket abuse, he went on in the post-match interview to state that he and Carlsen had "played like women" during the first set. Murray was booed for the remark, but explained later that the comment had been intended as a jocular response to what <!--del_lnk--> Svetlana Kuznetsova had said at the <!--del_lnk--> Hopman Cup. A few months later, Murray was fined $2,500 for swearing at the umpire during a <a href="../../wp/d/Davis_Cup.htm" title="Davis Cup">Davis Cup</a> doubles rubber with <!--del_lnk--> Serbia and Montenegro. Murray refused to shake hands with the umpire at the end of the match.</p>
       <p>In 2007, Murray suggested that tennis had a match-fixing problem, stating that everyone knows it goes on, in the wake of the investigation surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Nikolay Davydenko. Both Davydenko and <a href="../../wp/r/Rafael_Nadal.htm" title="Rafael Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> questioned his comments, but Murray responded that his words had been taken out of context.</p>
