Born in <!--del_lnk--> Pella in 356&nbsp;BC, Alexander was tutored by <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> until the age of 16. By the age of thirty, he had created one of the <!--del_lnk--> largest empires of the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_history.htm" title="Ancient history">ancient world</a>, stretching from the <!--del_lnk--> Ionian Sea to the <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>. He was undefeated in battle and is considered one of history's most successful commanders.</p>
       <p>Alexander succeeded his father, <!--del_lnk--> Philip II of Macedon, to the throne in 336&nbsp;BC after Philip was assassinated. Upon Philip's death, Alexander inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. He was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father's military expansion plans. In 334&nbsp;BC, he invaded <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Persia">Persian</a>-ruled <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor and began a <!--del_lnk--> series of campaigns that lasted ten years. Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of <!--del_lnk--> Issus and <!--del_lnk--> Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew the Persian King <!--del_lnk--> Darius III and conquered the entirety of the <!--del_lnk--> Persian Empire. At that point, his empire stretched from the <!--del_lnk--> Adriatic Sea to the <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus River">Indus River</a>.</p>
       <p>Seeking to reach the "ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea", he <!--del_lnk--> invaded India in 326&nbsp;BC, but was eventually forced to turn back at the demand of his troops. Alexander died in <!--del_lnk--> Babylon in 323&nbsp;BC, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of <!--del_lnk--> Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in several states ruled by the <!--del_lnk--> Diadochi, Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.</p>
       <p>Alexander's legacy includes the <!--del_lnk--> cultural diffusion his conquests engendered. He founded some <!--del_lnk--> twenty cities that bore his name, most notably <a href="../../wp/a/Alexandria.htm" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> in the mid-15th century. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles.htm" title="Achilles">Achilles</a>, and he features prominently in the history and myth of Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and <!--del_lnk--> military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Alexander was born on the 6th day of the ancient Greek month of <!--del_lnk--> Hekatombaion, which probably corresponds to 20 July 356&nbsp;BC, although the exact date is not known, in <!--del_lnk--> Pella, the capital of the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Macedonia_%2528ancient_kingdom%2529.htm" title="Macedonia (ancient kingdom)">Kingdom of Macedon</a>. He was the son of the king of Macedon, <!--del_lnk--> Philip II, and his fourth wife, <!--del_lnk--> Olympias, the daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Neoptolemus I, king of <!--del_lnk--> Epirus. Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely a result of giving birth to Alexander.</p>
       <p>Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood. According to the ancient Greek biographer <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch, Olympias, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunder bolt, causing a flame that spread "far and wide" before dying away. Some time after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a <!--del_lnk--> seal engraved with a lion's image. Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.</p>
       <p>On the day that Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a <a href="../../wp/s/Siege.htm" title="Siege">siege</a> on the city of <!--del_lnk--> Potidea on the peninsula of <!--del_lnk--> Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general <!--del_lnk--> Parmenion had defeated the combined <!--del_lnk--> Illyrian and <!--del_lnk--> Paeonian armies, and that his horses had won at the <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day, the <a href="../../wp/t/Temple_of_Artemis.htm" title="Temple of Artemis">Temple of Artemis</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Ephesus, one of the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led <!--del_lnk--> Hegesias of Magnesia to say that it had burnt down because <!--del_lnk--> Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander. Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his own instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.</p>

       <p>In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, <!--del_lnk--> Lanike, sister of Alexander's future general <!--del_lnk--> Cleitus the Black. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict <!--del_lnk--> Leonidas, a relative of his mother, and by Philip's general <!--del_lnk--> Lysimachus. Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the <!--del_lnk--> lyre, ride, fight, and hunt.</p>
       <p>When Alexander was ten years old, a trader from <!--del_lnk--> Thessaly brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen <!--del_lnk--> talents. The horse refused to be mounted and Philip ordered it away. Alexander however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed. Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: "My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you", and bought the horse for him. Alexander named it <!--del_lnk--> Bucephalas, meaning "ox-head". Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. When the animal died (due to old age, according to Plutarch, at age thirty), Alexander named a city after him, <!--del_lnk--> Bucephala. The primary (actually secondary) accounts are two: <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch's <i>Life of Alexander</i>, 6, and <!--del_lnk--> Arrian's <i><!--del_lnk--> Anabasis Alexandri</i> V.19., state that Bucephalus died after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC, in what is now modern <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and is buried in <!--del_lnk--> Jalalpur Sharif outside of <!--del_lnk--> Jhelum, <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. Another account states that Bucephalus is buried in <!--del_lnk--> Phalia, a town in Pakistan's <!--del_lnk--> Mandi Bahauddin District, which is named after him.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adolescence_and_education">Adolescence and education</span></h3>
       <p>When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a <!--del_lnk--> tutor, and considered such academics as <!--del_lnk--> Isocrates and <!--del_lnk--> Speusippus, the latter offering to resign to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at <!--del_lnk--> Mieza as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of <!--del_lnk--> Stageira, which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile.</p>
       <p>Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy, <!--del_lnk--> Hephaistion, and <!--del_lnk--> Cassander. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>, and in particular the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i>; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.</p>

       </div>
       <p>At age 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip waged war against <!--del_lnk--> Byzantion, leaving Alexander in charge as <!--del_lnk--> regent and <!--del_lnk--> heir apparent. During Philip's absence, the <!--del_lnk--> Thracian <!--del_lnk--> Maedi revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly, driving them from their territory. He colonized it with Greeks, and founded a city named <!--del_lnk--> Alexandropolis.</p>
       <p>Upon Philip's return, he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue revolts in southern <!--del_lnk--> Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of <!--del_lnk--> Perinthus, Alexander is reported to have saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of <!--del_lnk--> Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> near <!--del_lnk--> Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.</p>
       <p>Philip and his army joined his son in 338&nbsp;BC, and they marched south through <!--del_lnk--> Thermopylae, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of <!--del_lnk--> Elatea, only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians, led by <a href="../../wp/d/Demosthenes.htm" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes' favour, but Athens won the contest. Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of the <!--del_lnk--> Amphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by <a href="../../wp/d/Demosthenes.htm" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.</p>

       <p>As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near <!--del_lnk--> Chaeronea, <!--del_lnk--> Boeotia. During the ensuing <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian <!--del_lnk--> hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.</p>
       <p>After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached <a href="../../wp/s/Sparta.htm" title="Sparta">Sparta</a>, they were refused, but did not resort to war. At <!--del_lnk--> Corinth, Philip established a "Hellenic Alliance" (modeled on the old <!--del_lnk--> anti-Persian alliance of the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Persian Wars), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named <i><!--del_lnk--> Hegemon</i> (often translated as "Supreme Commander") of this league (known by modern scholars as the <!--del_lnk--> League of Corinth), and announced his plans to attack the <!--del_lnk--> Persian Empire.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Exile_and_return">Exile and return</span></h3>
       <p>When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married <!--del_lnk--> Cleopatra Eurydice, the niece of his general <!--del_lnk--> Attalus. The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian. During the wedding banquet, a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">

This so irritated Alexander, that throwing one of the cups at his head, "You villain," said he, "what, am I then a bastard?" Then Philip, taking Attalus's part, rose up and would have run his son through; but by good fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage, or the wine he had drunk, made his foot slip, so that he fell down on the floor. At which Alexander reproachfully insulted over him: "See there," said he, "the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned in passing from one seat to another."</div>

       <p>Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother, King <!--del_lnk--> Alexander I of Epirus in <!--del_lnk--> Dodona, capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian King and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, <!--del_lnk--> Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.</p>
       <p>In the following year, the Persian <!--del_lnk--> satrap (governor) of <!--del_lnk--> Caria, <!--del_lnk--> Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, <!--del_lnk--> Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, <!--del_lnk--> Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, <!--del_lnk--> Harpalus, <!--del_lnk--> Nearchus, Ptolemy and <!--del_lnk--> Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.</p>

       </div>
       <p>In 336&nbsp;BC, while at <!--del_lnk--> Aegae attending the wedding of his daughter <!--del_lnk--> Cleopatra to Olympias's brother, <!--del_lnk--> Alexander I of Epirus, Philip was assassinated by the captain of his <!--del_lnk--> bodyguards, <!--del_lnk--> Pausanias. As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of Alexander's companions, <!--del_lnk--> Perdiccas and <!--del_lnk--> Leonnatus. Alexander was proclaimed king by the nobles and <!--del_lnk--> army at the age of 20.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Consolidation_of_power">Consolidation of power</span></h3>
       <p>Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former <!--del_lnk--> Amyntas IV, executed. He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of <!--del_lnk--> Lyncestis killed, but spared a third, <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Lyncestes. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle.</p>
       <p>Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive. Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.</p>
       <p>News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered the Macedonian cavalry of 3,000 and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between <!--del_lnk--> Mount Olympus and <!--del_lnk--> Mount Ossa, and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued south towards the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnese.</p>
       <p>Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to <!--del_lnk--> Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous <!--del_lnk--> encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight. This reply apparently delighted Alexander, who is reported to have said "But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes." At Corinth Alexander took the title of <i>Hegemon</i> ("leader"), and like Philip, was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Balkan_campaign">Balkan campaign</span></h3>
       <p>Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335&nbsp;BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from <!--del_lnk--> Amphipolis, he traveled east into the country of the "Independent Thracians"; and at <!--del_lnk--> Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. The Macedonians marched into the country of the <!--del_lnk--> Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a <!--del_lnk--> tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the <a href="../../wp/d/Danube.htm" title="Danube">Danube</a>, encountering the <!--del_lnk--> Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry <!--del_lnk--> skirmish.</p>
       <p>News then reached Alexander that <!--del_lnk--> Cleitus, King of Illyria, and <!--del_lnk--> King Glaukias of the <!--del_lnk--> Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.</p>
       <p>While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace. Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving <!--del_lnk--> Antipater as regent.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Alexander's army crossed the <!--del_lnk--> Hellespont in 334&nbsp;BC with approximately 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000, drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from <!--del_lnk--> Thrace, <!--del_lnk--> Paionia, and <!--del_lnk--> Illyria. He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.</p>
       <p>The Battle of Granicus was one of the first battles he fought on his conquest to rule Asia. His naivety could be seen through his actions as he was &lsquo;closest to failure and death&rsquo; in this battle. It was here that he was learning how to implement the strategies Aristotle had taught him during childhood. Alexander was a wise leader who could see the flaws in military strategy better than even his own military generals, &lsquo;Alexander&hellip;rejected Parmenion&rsquo;s advice&hellip; to capitalize on the Persians&rsquo; error in tactical deployment&rsquo;. Alexander the Great demonstrated extreme hubris in this battle, though he was not experienced, which causes speculation that he, due to his royal nature, believed he was superior to others.</p>
       <p>After an initial victory against Persian forces at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Granicus, Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of <!--del_lnk--> Sardis and proceeded along the <!--del_lnk--> Ionian coast. Though Alexander believed in his divine power to fight with the lives of men he did experience sorry as those who died were rewarded generously. &lsquo;To the relatives of his fallen, Alexander granted immunity from taxation and public service&rsquo;. Whether it was his own warriors of the Persian forces opposing him, Alexander chose to respect those who died. He even went so far to set up statues to honour and respect these people. Though this did not directly influence the culture of the Persians they did not feel the need to begin a rebellion as their men and rulers were treated with proper respect. At <!--del_lnk--> Halicarnassus, in <!--del_lnk--> Caria, Alexander successfully waged the first of many <a href="../../wp/s/Siege.htm" title="Siege">sieges</a>, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain <!--del_lnk--> Memnon of Rhodes and the Persian <!--del_lnk--> satrap of Caria, <!--del_lnk--> Orontobates, to withdraw by sea. Alexander left the government of Caria to <!--del_lnk--> Ada, who adopted Alexander.</p>
       <p>From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous <!--del_lnk--> Lycia and the <!--del_lnk--> Pamphylian plain, asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases. From Pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland. At <!--del_lnk--> Termessos, Alexander humbled but did not storm the <!--del_lnk--> Pisidian city. At the ancient Phrygian capital of <!--del_lnk--> Gordium, Alexander "undid" the hitherto unsolvable <!--del_lnk--> Gordian Knot, a feat said to await the future "king of <!--del_lnk--> Asia". According to the story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword.</p>

       <p>Alexander journeyed south but was met by Darius&rsquo; significantly larger army which he easily defeated, causing Darius to panic. Although he was chased by some troops &lsquo;Alexander treated them (his family) with the respect out of consideration&rsquo; which demonstrated his continued generosity and kindness towards those he conquered. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother <!--del_lnk--> Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. He offered a <!--del_lnk--> peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 <!--del_lnk--> talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.</p>
       <p>Alexander the Great, although a generous man in victory, eventually recognized the power that he was capable of when he would defeat an enemy in war. Following the siege of Tyre in 332, the enemy he defeated, Darius, attempted to present terms of unconditional surrender but Alexander became ruthless. He realized that he had control and could receive much more. Darius was thus forced to come back, &lsquo;This time the offer was impressive. Darius offered all territory as a far the Euphrates&hellip; a colossal ransom of 30,000 talents for his family&hellip;invited to marry his eldest daughter&rsquo;. This new change in diplomatic relations induced panic among the leaders of the surrounding nations, as they feared a similar defeat. This led to some barbarian cultures choosing to merely abdicate power to Alexander, to avoid certain death.&rdquo;</p>
       <p>Alexander proceeded to take possession of <!--del_lnk--> Syria, and most of the coast of the <!--del_lnk--> Levant. In the following year, 332&nbsp;BC, he was forced to attack <!--del_lnk--> Tyre, which he captured after a long and difficult <!--del_lnk--> siege. Alexander massacred the men of military age and sold the women and children into <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a>.</p>

       <p>When Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated, with the exception of <!--del_lnk--> Gaza. The stronghold at Gaza was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. Alexander came upon the city only to be met with a surprising resistance and fortification. When &lsquo;his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible&hellip; this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt&rsquo; . The divine right that Alexander believed he had gave him confidence of a miracle occurring. After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children sold into slavery.</p>
       <p>Jerusalem instead opened its gates in surrender, and according to <a href="../../wp/j/Josephus.htm" title="Josephus">Josephus</a>, Alexander was shown the <!--del_lnk--> Book of Daniel's prophecy, presumably chapter 8, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. He spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt.</p>
       <p>Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332&nbsp;BC, where he was regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced the new "master of the Universe" and son of the deity of <!--del_lnk--> Amun at the <!--del_lnk--> Oracle of <!--del_lnk--> Siwa Oasis in the <!--del_lnk--> Libyan desert. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus-Ammon">Zeus-Ammon</a> as his true father, and subsequent currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity.

       <p>From Babylon, Alexander went to <!--del_lnk--> Susa, one of the <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenid capitals, and captured its legendary treasury. He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of <!--del_lnk--> Persepolis via the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He had to storm the pass of the <!--del_lnk--> Persian Gates (in the modern <!--del_lnk--> Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under <!--del_lnk--> Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.</p>
       <p>On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days. Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months.

       <p>Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia. The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by <!--del_lnk--> Bessus, his <!--del_lnk--> Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a <!--del_lnk--> guerrilla campaign against Alexander. Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne. The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.</p>
       <p>Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him. This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern <!--del_lnk--> Kandahar in Afghanistan, and <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria Eschate ("The Furthest") in modern <a href="../../wp/t/Tajikistan.htm" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>. The campaign took Alexander through <!--del_lnk--> Media, <!--del_lnk--> Parthia, <!--del_lnk--> Aria (West Afghanistan), <!--del_lnk--> Drangiana, <!--del_lnk--> Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), <!--del_lnk--> Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan), and <!--del_lnk--> Scythia.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Spitamenes, who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, in 329&nbsp;BC betrayed Bessus to <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy, one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed. However, when, at some point later, Alexander was on the <!--del_lnk--> Jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes, defeating him in the Battle of Gabai. After the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace. The empire began falling as military leaders and eventually Alexander died.</p>
       <p>The cultural effects of Alexander&rsquo;s conquests of the Persian Empire was great. Once the Greek ruler was able to control this area, the Greek culture was installed there by keeping some troops and military leaders there. He was so successful at hybridizing the Greek culture with their prior one, they simply could not live without the constant present of the new Greek culture and traditions. &lsquo;Plutarch simply lists Alexander&rsquo;s principal foundations, and states that they mitigated the primitive savagery of the natives. This does scant justice to the culture of the Achaemenids, and overstates the sophistication of Alexander&rsquo;s cities&hellip;a mass movement by the new colonists back to Greece &lsquo;out of longing for Greek upbringing and culture&rsquo;. Following the death of Alexander, many people who were conquered felt that the Greek society that they had grown accustomed to was not as strong. Thus many of the people who were in the vast empire Alexander the Great has created throughout his conquests chose to migrate back to the Greek homeland and strengthen their new culture. Although the immediate effects of the campaign were not well documented it can be seen that the impact was substantial and long-lasting.</p>

       <p>During this time, Alexander took the Persian title "King of Kings" (<i>Shahanshah</i>) and adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of <i><!--del_lnk--> proskynesis</i>, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Deity.htm" title="Deities">deities</a> and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.</p>
       <p>A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, <!--del_lnk--> Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus <!--del_lnk--> Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at <!--del_lnk--> Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, <!--del_lnk--> Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at <!--del_lnk--> Maracanda (modern day <!--del_lnk--> Samarkand in <a href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan.htm" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgot the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.</p>
       <p>Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal <!--del_lnk--> pages. His official historian, <!--del_lnk--> Callisthenes of <!--del_lnk--> Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach consensus regarding this involvement. Callisthenes had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Macedon_in_Alexander.27s_absence">Macedon in Alexander's absence</span></h3>
       <p>When Alexander set out for Asia, he left his general <!--del_lnk--> Antipater, an experienced military and political leader and part of Philip II's "Old Guard", in charge of Macedon. Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence. The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king <!--del_lnk--> Agis III in 331 BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in battle at <!--del_lnk--> Megalopolis the following year. Antipater referred the Spartans' punishment to the League of Corinth, which then deferred to Alexander, who chose to pardon them. There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias, and each complained to Alexander about the other.</p>
       <p>In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire. However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's manpower, greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome.</p>

       </div>
       <p>After the death of <!--del_lnk--> Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in <!--del_lnk--> Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent. He invited the <!--del_lnk--> chieftains of the former satrapy of <!--del_lnk--> Gandhara, in the north of what is now <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, to come to him and submit to his authority. <!--del_lnk--> Omphis, ruler of <!--del_lnk--> Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus">Indus</a> to the <!--del_lnk--> Hydaspes, complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the <!--del_lnk--> Aspasioi and <!--del_lnk--> Assakenoi sections of the <!--del_lnk--> Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit.</p>
       <p>In the winter of 327/326&nbsp;BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of <!--del_lnk--> Kunar <!--del_lnk--> valleys, the Guraeans of the <!--del_lnk--> Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the <!--del_lnk--> Swat and <!--del_lnk--> Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and <!--del_lnk--> Aornos.</p>
       <p>The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to <!--del_lnk--> Curtius, "Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of <!--del_lnk--> Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.</p>
       <p>After Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus and fought and won an epic battle against <!--del_lnk--> King Porus, who ruled a region in the <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Hydaspes in 326&nbsp;BC. Alexander was impressed by Porus's bravery, and made him an ally. He appointed Porus as satrap, and added to Porus' territory land that he did not previously own. Choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from Greece. Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the <!--del_lnk--> Hydaspes river, naming one <!--del_lnk--> Bucephala, in honour of his horse, who died around this time. The other was <!--del_lnk--> Nicaea (Victory) located at the site of modern day <!--del_lnk--> Mong, Punjab.</p>

       <p>Discovering that many of his <!--del_lnk--> satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to <!--del_lnk--> Susa. As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of <!--del_lnk--> Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.</p>
       <p>After three days, unable to persuade his men to back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together. In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. Meanwhile, upon his return, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of <a href="../../wp/c/Cyrus_the_Great.htm" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a> had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them.</p>
       <p>After Alexander traveled to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure, his closest friend and possible lover, <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning.

Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but he would not have a chance to realize them, as he died shortly thereafter.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>On either 10 or 11 June 323&nbsp;BC, Alexander died in the palace of <!--del_lnk--> Nebuchadnezzar II, in <!--del_lnk--> Babylon, at age 32. Details of the death differ slightly &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral <!--del_lnk--> Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with <!--del_lnk--> Medius of Larissa.</p>
       <p>He developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of <!--del_lnk--> Hercules, and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch specifically denied this claim.</p>
       <p>Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness.</p>
       <p>The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.</p>
       <p>The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available. In 2010, however, a new theory proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (<!--del_lnk--> Mavroneri) that contained <!--del_lnk--> calicheamicin, a dangerous compound produced by <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>.</p>
       <p>Several <!--del_lnk--> natural causes (diseases) have been suggested, including <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Typhoid_fever.htm" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a>. A 1998 article in the <i><!--del_lnk--> New England Journal of Medicine</i> attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by <!--del_lnk--> bowel perforation and ascending <!--del_lnk--> paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested <!--del_lnk--> pyrogenic spondylitis or <a href="../../wp/m/Meningitis.htm" title="Meningitis">meningitis</a>. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including <!--del_lnk--> acute pancreatitis and <!--del_lnk--> West Nile virus.</p>
       <p>Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasise that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health. The most likely possible cause is an overdose of medication containing <!--del_lnk--> hellebore, which is deadly in large doses.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid <!--del_lnk--> sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket. According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest "would be happy and unvanquishable forever". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a <!--del_lnk--> royal prerogative.</p>
       <p>While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy stole it and took it to Memphis. His successor, <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least <!--del_lnk--> late Antiquity. <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Pompey, <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Augustus</a> all visited the tomb in Alexandria. The latter allegedly accidentally knocked the nose off the body. <!--del_lnk--> Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. In c. AD 200, Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, <!--del_lnk--> Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy.</p>
       <p>The so-called "<!--del_lnk--> Alexander Sarcophagus", discovered near <!--del_lnk--> Sidon and now in the <!--del_lnk--> Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of <!--del_lnk--> Abdalonymus (died 311&nbsp;BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Issus in 331. However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Alexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed. Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was "t&ocirc;i kratist&ocirc;i"&mdash;"to the strongest".</p>
       <p>Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his <!--del_lnk--> signet ring to <!--del_lnk--> Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.</p>
       <p>Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, <!--del_lnk--> Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only.</p>
       <p>Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the <!--del_lnk--> Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321&nbsp;BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between "The Successors" (<i>Diadochi</i>) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: the <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, the <!--del_lnk--> Seleucid Empire in the east, the Kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Pergamon in Asia Minor, and Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Testament">Testament</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Diodorus stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death. Craterus started to carry out Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant. Nevertheless, Perdiccas read Alexander's will to his troops.</p>
       <p>The testament called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean, monumental constructions, and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations. It included:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Construction of a monumental tomb for his father Philip, "to match the greatest of the <a href="../../wp/e/Egyptian_pyramids.htm" title="Egyptian pyramids">pyramids of Egypt</a>"</li>

        <li>Conquest of Arabia and the entire Mediterranean Basin</li>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Alexander earned the epithet "the Great" due to his unparalleled success as a military commander. He never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. This was due to use of terrain, <!--del_lnk--> phalanx and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops. The <!--del_lnk--> Macedonian phalanx, armed with the <!--del_lnk--> sarissa, a spear 6 metres (20&nbsp;ft) long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces. Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army, which employed various languages and weapons. He overcame this by being personally involved in battle, in the manner of a Macedonian king.</p>
       <p>In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. Alexander placed the phalanx at the centre and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about 3&nbsp;km (1.86&nbsp;mi). By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persian's <!--del_lnk--> scimitars and <!--del_lnk--> javelins. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.</p>
       <p>At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' centre, causing the latter to flee once again.</p>
       <p>When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in <!--del_lnk--> Bactria and <!--del_lnk--> Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the centre. In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.</p>

       <p>The semi-legendary <i><!--del_lnk--> Alexander Romance</i> also suggests that Alexander suffered from <!--del_lnk--> heterochromia iridum: that one eye was dark and the other light.</p>

       <p>Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by <!--del_lnk--> Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image. <!--del_lnk--> Lysippos had often used the <!--del_lnk--> Contrapposto sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as <!--del_lnk--> Apoxyomenos, <!--del_lnk--> Hermes and <!--del_lnk--> Eros. Lysippos' sculpture, famous for its naturalism, as opposed to a stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction.</p>

       <p>Some of Alexander's strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents. His mother had huge ambitions, and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire. Olympias' influence instilled a sense of destiny in him, and Plutarch tells us that his ambition "kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years". However, his father Philip was Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds. Alexander's relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to out-do his father, illustrated by his reckless behaviour in battle. While Alexander worried that his father would leave him "no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world", he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions.</p>
       <p>According to Plutarch, among Alexander's traits were a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature, which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions. Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate. He had a calmer side&mdash;perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader. This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn. His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general. He had great self-restraint in "pleasures of the body", in contrast with his lack of <!--del_lnk--> self control with alcohol.</p>
       <p>Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences. However, he had little interest in sports or the <!--del_lnk--> Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homeric">Homeric</a> ideals of honour (<i>tim&ecirc;</i>) and glory (<i>kudos</i>). He had great <!--del_lnk--> charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death&nbsp;&ndash; only Alexander had the ability to do so.</p>
       <p>During his final years, and especially after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of <!--del_lnk--> megalomania and <!--del_lnk--> paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His <!--del_lnk--> delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his <a href="#Testament">testament</a> and in his desire to conquer the world.</p>
       <p>He appears to have believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at <!--del_lnk--> Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably <i><!--del_lnk--> proskynesis</i>, a practice that Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behavior cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The central personal relationship of Alexander's life was with his friend, general, and bodyguard <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached <!--del_lnk--> mental state during his final months.</p>
       <p>Alexander married twice: <!--del_lnk--> Roxana, daughter of the <!--del_lnk--> Bactrian nobleman <!--del_lnk--> Oxyartes, out of love; and <!--del_lnk--> Stateira II, a Persian princess and daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Darius III of Persia, for political reasons. He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, <!--del_lnk--> Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.</p>
       <p>Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy. No ancient sources stated that Alexander had <!--del_lnk--> homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to <!--del_lnk--> Troy where "Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of <!--del_lnk--> Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles". Noting that the word <i><!--del_lnk--> eromenos</i> (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial.</p>
       <p>Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age. Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in "pleasures of the body". Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her. Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including <!--del_lnk--> Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's mother <!--del_lnk--> Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.</p>

       <p>Alexander's legacy extended beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hellenistic_kingdoms">Hellenistic kingdoms</span></h3>
       <p>Alexander's most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. At the time of his death, Alexander's empire covered some 5,200,000 km<sup>2</sup> (2,000,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), and was the largest state of its time. Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200&ndash;300 years. The <!--del_lnk--> successor states that emerged were, at least initially, dominant forces, and these 300 years are often referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic period.</p>

       <p>The eastern borders of Alexander's empire began to collapse even during his lifetime. However, the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history. Taking advantage of this, <!--del_lnk--> Chandragupta Maurya (referred to in Greek sources as "Sandrokottos"), of relatively humble origin, took control of the <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, and with that power base proceeded to conquer the <!--del_lnk--> Nanda Empire.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Founding_of_cities">Founding of cities</span></h3>
       <p>Over the course of his conquests, Alexander founded some <!--del_lnk--> twenty cities that bore his name, most of them east of the <a href="../../wp/t/Tigris.htm" title="Tigris">Tigris</a>. The first, and greatest, was <a href="../../wp/a/Alexandria.htm" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in Egypt, which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities. The cities locations' reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first the cities must have been inhospitable, little more than defensive garrisons. Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece. However, a century or so after Alexander's death, many of the Alexandrias were thriving, with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p><i>Hellenization</i> was coined by the German historian <!--del_lnk--> Johann Gustav Droysen to denote the spread of Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. That this export took place is undoubted, and can be seen in the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, <a href="../../wp/a/Alexandria.htm" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Antioch and <!--del_lnk--> Seleucia (south of modern <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>). Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into <!--del_lnk--> Persian culture and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the Successor states.</p>
       <p>The core of Hellenistic culture was essentially <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athenian">Athenian</a>. The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander's army directly led to the emergence of the largely <!--del_lnk--> Attic-based "<!--del_lnk--> koine", or "common" Greek dialect. Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world, becoming the <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca of Hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of <!--del_lnk--> modern Greek. Furthermore, <!--del_lnk--> town planning, education, local government, and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals, evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic. Aspects of Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in India, in the region of the relatively late-arising <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Greek kingdoms. There, isolated from Europe, Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a>, influences. The first realistic portrayals of the <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Buddha</a> appeared at this time; they were modeled on Greek statues of <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a>. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Greek religion: the concept of <!--del_lnk--> Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana <!--del_lnk--> ceremonial practices (burning <!--del_lnk--> incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks. <!--del_lnk--> Zen Buddhism draws in part on the ideas of Greek <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Stoicism.htm" title="Stoics">stoics</a>, such as <!--del_lnk--> Zeno. One Greek king, <!--del_lnk--> Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization extended to the sciences, where ideas from <!--del_lnk--> Greek astronomy filtered eastward and had profoundly influenced <!--del_lnk--> Indian astronomy by the early centuries AD. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrian city of <!--del_lnk--> Ai Khanoum in modern-day <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> while the Greek concept of a <!--del_lnk--> spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets was adopted in India and eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a flat and circular earth. The <!--del_lnk--> Yavanajataka and <!--del_lnk--> Paulisa Siddhanta texts in particular show Greek influence.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Influence_on_Rome">Influence on Rome</span></h3>
       <p>Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans, especially generals, who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements. <!--del_lnk--> Polybius began his <i><!--del_lnk--> Histories</i> by reminding Romans of Alexander's achievements, and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model. <!--del_lnk--> Pompey the Great adopted the epithet "Magnus" and even Alexander's anatole-type haircut, and searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which he then wore as a sign of greatness. <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> dedicated a <!--del_lnk--> Lysippean <!--del_lnk--> equestrian <!--del_lnk--> bronze statue but replaced Alexander's head with his own, while <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Octavian">Octavian</a> visited Alexander's tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a <!--del_lnk--> sphinx to Alexander's profile. The emperor <!--del_lnk--> Trajan also admired Alexander, as did <!--del_lnk--> Nero and <!--del_lnk--> Caracalla. The Macriani, a Roman family that in the person of <!--del_lnk--> Macrinus briefly ascended to the imperial throne, kept images of Alexander on their persons, either on jewelry, or embroidered into their clothes.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>On the other hand, some Roman writers, particularly Republican figures, used Alexander as a cautionary tale of how <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Autocracy.htm" title="Autocratic">autocratic</a> tendencies can be kept in check by <!--del_lnk--> republican values. Alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as <i>amicita</i> (friendship) and <i>clementia</i> (clemency), but also <i>iracundia</i> (anger) and <i>cupiditas gloriae</i> (over-desire for glory).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Legend">Legend</span></h3>
       <p>Legendary accounts surround the life of Alexander the Great, many deriving from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself. His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in <!--del_lnk--> Cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing shortly after Alexander's death, another participant, <!--del_lnk--> Onesicritus, invented a <!--del_lnk--> tryst between Alexander and <!--del_lnk--> Thalestris, queen of the mythical <!--del_lnk--> Amazons. When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron, Alexander's general and later King <!--del_lnk--> Lysimachus reportedly quipped, "I wonder where I was at the time."</p>
       <p>In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Alexander Romance</i>, later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known as <i>Pseudo-Callisthenes</i>. This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, containing many dubious stories, and was translated into numerous languages.</p>

The <i>Alexander Romance</i>, in particular, has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures, from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek.</p>
       <p>Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore, more so than any other ancient figure. The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek ("O Megalexandros") is a household name, and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the <!--del_lnk--> Karagiozis shadow play. One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary <!--del_lnk--> mermaid who would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain "Is King Alexander alive?". The correct answer is "He is alive and well and rules the world!", causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm. Any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging <!--del_lnk--> Gorgon who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea, all hands aboard.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Syriac version of the <i>Alexander Romance</i> portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to "the one true God".

       <p>The figure of <!--del_lnk--> Dhul-Qarnayn (literally "the Two-Horned One") mentioned in the <a href="../../wp/q/Quran.htm" title="Quran">Quran</a> is believed by some scholars to represent Alexander, due to parallels with the <i>Alexander Romance</i>.

Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and <!--del_lnk--> Nearchus; <!--del_lnk--> Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these <!--del_lnk--> original sources have survived. The earliest of these is <!--del_lnk--> Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally <!--del_lnk--> Justin, whose work dated as late as the 4th century. Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.</p>
