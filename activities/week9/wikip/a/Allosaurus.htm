The name <i>Allosaurus</i> means "different lizard". It is derived from the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greek.htm" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F04;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>/<i>allos</i> ("different, other") and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&sigma;&alpha;&#x1FE6;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>/<i>sauros</i> ("lizard"). The first remains that can definitely be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist <!--del_lnk--> Othniel Charles Marsh. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">paleontological</a> circles. Indeed, it has been a top feature in several <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">films</a> and <!--del_lnk--> documentaries about prehistoric life.</p>
       <p><i>Allosaurus</i> was a large <!--del_lnk--> bipedal <!--del_lnk--> predator. Its <!--del_lnk--> skull was large and equipped with dozens of large, sharp <!--del_lnk--> teeth. It averaged 8.5&nbsp;m (28&nbsp;ft) in length, though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over 12&nbsp;m (39&nbsp;ft). Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long, heavy tail. It is classified as an <!--del_lnk--> allosaurid, a type of <!--del_lnk--> carnosaurian theropod dinosaur. The genus has a complicated <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy, and includes an uncertain number of valid <a href="../../wp/s/Species.htm" title="Species">species</a>, the best known of which is <i>A. fragilis</i>. The bulk of <i>Allosaurus</i> remains have come from <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> Morrison Formation, with material also known from <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> and possibly <a href="../../wp/t/Tanzania.htm" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. It was known for over half of the 20th century as <i><!--del_lnk--> Antrodemus</i>, but study of the copious remains from the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry brought the name <i>Allosaurus</i> back to prominence, and established it as one of the best-known dinosaurs.</p>
       <p>As the most abundant large predator in the Morrison Formation, <i>Allosaurus</i> was at the top of the <!--del_lnk--> food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs and perhaps even other predators (e.g. <i><!--del_lnk--> Ceratosaurus</i>). Potential prey included <!--del_lnk--> ornithopods, <!--del_lnk--> stegosaurids, and <!--del_lnk--> sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret <i>Allosaurus</i> as having had cooperative <!--del_lnk--> social behaviour, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a <!--del_lnk--> hatchet.</p>

       <p><i>Allosaurus</i> was a typical large <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropod">theropod</a>, having a massive <!--del_lnk--> skull on a short <!--del_lnk--> neck, a long <!--del_lnk--> tail and reduced forelimbs. <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i>, the best-known species, had an average length of 8.5&nbsp;m (28&nbsp;ft), with the largest definitive <i>Allosaurus</i> specimen (<!--del_lnk--> AMNH 680) estimated at 9.7&nbsp;meters long (32&nbsp;ft), and an estimated weight of 2.3&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metric tons (2.5&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> short tons). In his 1976 <!--del_lnk--> monograph on <i>Allosaurus</i>, James Madsen mentioned a range of bone sizes which he interpreted to show a maximum length of 12 to 13&nbsp;m (40 to 43&nbsp;ft). As with dinosaurs in general, weight estimates are debatable, and since 1980 have ranged between 1500&nbsp;kilograms (3300&nbsp;lb), 1000 to 4000&nbsp;kilograms (2200 to 8800&nbsp;lb), and 1010&nbsp;kilograms (2230&nbsp;lb) for <a href="../../wp/m/Mode_%2528statistics%2529.htm" title="Mode (statistics)">modal</a> adult weight (not maximum). John Foster, a specialist on the Morrison Formation, suggests that 1000&nbsp;kg (2200&nbsp;lb) is reasonable for large adults of <i>A. fragilis</i>, but that 700&nbsp;kg (1500&nbsp;lb) is a closer estimate for individuals represented by the average-sized <!--del_lnk--> thigh bones he has measured. Using the subadult specimen nicknamed "Big Al", researchers using computer modelling arrived at a best estimate of 1,500 kilograms (3,300&nbsp;lb) for the individual, but by varying parameters they found a range from approximately 1,400 kilograms (3,100&nbsp;lb) to approximately 2,000 kilograms (4,400&nbsp;lb).</p>
       <p>Several <!--del_lnk--> gigantic specimens have been attributed to <i>Allosaurus</i>, but may in fact belong to other genera. The closely related genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Saurophaganax</i> (<!--del_lnk--> OMNH 1708) reached perhaps 10.9&nbsp;m (36&nbsp;ft) in length, and its single species has sometimes been included in the genus <i>Allosaurus</i> as <i>Allosaurus maximus</i>, though recent studies support it as a separate genus. Another potential <!--del_lnk--> specimen of <i>Allosaurus</i>, once assigned to the genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Epanterias</i> (AMNH 5767), may have measured 12.1&nbsp;meters in length (40&nbsp;ft). A more recent discovery is a partial skeleton from the Peterson Quarry in Morrison rocks of <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico; this large allosaurid may be another individual of <i>Saurophaganax</i>.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The skull and teeth of <i>Allosaurus</i> were modestly proportioned for a theropod of its size. Paleontologist <!--del_lnk--> Gregory S. Paul gives a length of 845&nbsp;mm (33.3&nbsp;in) for a skull belonging to an individual he estimates at 7.9&nbsp;m long (26&nbsp;ft). Each <!--del_lnk--> premaxilla (the bones that formed the tip of the snout), held five teeth with D-shaped cross-sections, and each <!--del_lnk--> maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth; the number of teeth does not exactly correspond to the size of the bone. Each <!--del_lnk--> dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth, with an average count of 16. The teeth became shorter, more narrow, and more curved toward the back of the skull. All of the teeth had saw-like edges. They were shed easily, and were replaced continually, making them common fossils.</p>
       <p>The skull had a pair of <!--del_lnk--> horns above and in front of the eyes. These horns were composed of extensions of the <!--del_lnk--> lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the <!--del_lnk--> nasal bones that led into the horns. The horns were probably covered in a <!--del_lnk--> keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in <!--del_lnk--> tyrannosaurids.</p>
       <p>Inside the lacrimal bones were depressions that may have held <!--del_lnk--> glands, such as <!--del_lnk--> salt glands. Within the maxillae were <!--del_lnk--> sinuses that were better developed than those of more <!--del_lnk--> basal theropods such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Ceratosaurus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Marshosaurus</i>; they may have been related to the <!--del_lnk--> sense of smell, perhaps holding something like <!--del_lnk--> Jacobson's organ. The roof of the braincase was thin, perhaps to improve <!--del_lnk--> thermoregulation for the <a href="../../wp/b/Brain.htm" title="Brain">brain</a>. The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal's gape. The <!--del_lnk--> braincase and <!--del_lnk--> frontals may also have had a joint.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Postcranial_skeleton">Postcranial skeleton</span></h3>
       <p><i>Allosaurus</i> had nine <!--del_lnk--> vertebrae in the neck, 14 in the back, and five in the <!--del_lnk--> sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and <!--del_lnk--> anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held <!--del_lnk--> air sacs used in <!--del_lnk--> respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less <!--del_lnk--> derived theropods like <i>Ceratosaurus</i>. <i>Allosaurus</i> had <!--del_lnk--> gastralia (belly ribs), but these are not common findings, and they may have <!--del_lnk--> ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A <!--del_lnk--> furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The <!--del_lnk--> ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the <!--del_lnk--> pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a <!--del_lnk--> sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.</p>

       <p>The forelimbs of <i>Allosaurus</i> were short in comparison to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed <!--del_lnk--> claws. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> humerus/<!--del_lnk--> ulna ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate <!--del_lnk--> carpal also found in more derived theropods like <!--del_lnk--> maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or <!--del_lnk--> thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of <!--del_lnk--> tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more <!--del_lnk--> hoof-like than those of earlier theropods. Each foot had three weight-bearing toes and an inner <!--del_lnk--> dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) <!--del_lnk--> metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles_tendon.htm" title="Achilles tendon">Achilles tendon</a> and foot.</p>

       <p><i>Allosaurus</i> was an allosaurid, a member of a <!--del_lnk--> family of large theropods within the larger group <!--del_lnk--> Carnosauria. The family name <!--del_lnk--> Allosauridae was created for this genus in 1878 by <!--del_lnk--> Othniel Charles Marsh, but the term was largely unused until the 1970s in favour of <!--del_lnk--> Megalosauridae, another family of large theropods that eventually became a <!--del_lnk--> wastebasket taxon. This, along with the use of <i>Antrodemus</i> for <i>Allosaurus</i> during the same period, is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on <i>Allosaurus</i> in publications that predate James Madsen's 1976 monograph. Major publications using the name Megalosauridae instead of Allosauridae include <!--del_lnk--> Gilmore, 1920, <!--del_lnk--> von Huene, 1926, <!--del_lnk--> Romer, 1956 and 1966, Steel, 1970, and <!--del_lnk--> Walker, 1964.</p>
       <p>Following the publication of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae for a variety of large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that were thought to be related to <i>Allosaurus</i> included <i><!--del_lnk--> Indosaurus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Piatnitzkysaurus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Piveteausaurus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Yangchuanosaurus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Acrocanthosaurus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Chilantaisaurus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Compsosuchus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Stokesosaurus</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Szechuanosaurus</i>. Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> and <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>, are members of closely related families.</p>
       <p>Allosauridae is one of four families in Carnosauria; the other three are <!--del_lnk--> Neovenatoridae, <!--del_lnk--> Carcharodontosauridae and <!--del_lnk--> Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the <!--del_lnk--> Tyrannosauridae (which would make it <!--del_lnk--> paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's <i>Predatory Dinosaurs of the World</i>, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the <!--del_lnk--> Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only <i>Saurophaganax</i> and a currently unnamed <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> <!--del_lnk--> allosauroid accepted as possible valid <a href="../../wp/g/Genus.htm" title="Genus">genera</a> besides <i>Allosaurus</i> in the most recent review. Another genus, <i>Epanterias</i>, is a potential valid member, but it and <i>Saurophaganax</i> may turn out to be large examples of <i>Allosaurus</i>. Recent reviews have kept the genus <i>Saurophaganax</i> and included <i>Epanterias</i> with <i>Allosaurus</i>.</p>

       <p>The discovery and early study of <i>Allosaurus</i> is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the <!--del_lnk--> Bone Wars of the late 19th century. The first described <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossil</a> in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden in 1869. It came from <!--del_lnk--> Middle Park, near <!--del_lnk--> Granby, Colorado, probably from <!--del_lnk--> Morrison Formation rocks. The locals had identified such bones as "petrified <a href="../../wp/h/Horse.htm" title="Horse">horse</a> hoofs". Hayden sent his specimen to <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Leidy, who identified it as half of a tail vertebra, and tentatively assigned it to the European dinosaur genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Poekilopleuron</i> as <i>Poicilopleuron</i> [<i><!--del_lnk--> sic</i>] <i>valens</i>. He later decided it deserved its own genus, <i>Antrodemus</i>.</p>

       <p><i>Allosaurus</i> itself is <!--del_lnk--> based on <!--del_lnk--> YPM 1930, a small collection of fragmentary bones including parts of three vertebrae, a rib fragment, a tooth, a toe bone, and, most useful for later discussions, the shaft of the right humerus (upper arm). Othniel Charles Marsh gave these remains the formal name <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i> in 1877. <i>Allosaurus</i> comes from the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greek.htm" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a> <i>allos/&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i>, meaning "strange" or "different" and <i>sauros/&sigma;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i>, meaning "lizard" or "reptile". It was named 'different lizard' because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery. The species epithet <i>fragilis</i> is <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> for "fragile", referring to lightening features in the vertebrae. The bones were collected from the Morrison Formation of <!--del_lnk--> Garden Park, north of <!--del_lnk--> Ca&ntilde;on City. Marsh and <!--del_lnk--> Edward Drinker Cope, who were in scientific competition, went on to coin several other genera based on similarly sparse material that would later figure in the taxonomy of <i>Allosaurus</i>. These include Marsh's <i>Creosaurus</i> and <i>Labrosaurus</i>, and Cope's <i>Epanterias</i>.</p>
       <p>In their haste, Cope and Marsh did not always follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the discovery by <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Mudge of the type specimen of <i>Allosaurus</i> in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in <!--del_lnk--> Wyoming; when work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete <i>Allosaurus</i> and several partial skeletons. In addition, one of Cope's collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the <!--del_lnk--> Como Bluff area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness, and Cope never unpacked it. Upon unpacking in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it was found to be one of the most complete theropod specimens then known, and in 1908 the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view. This is the well-known mount poised over a partial <i><a href="../../wp/a/Apatosaurus.htm" title="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a></i> skeleton as if <!--del_lnk--> scavenging it, illustrated as such by Charles R. Knight. Although notable as the first free-standing mount of a theropod dinosaur, and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described.</p>
       <p>The multiplicity of early names complicated later research, with the situation compounded by the terse descriptions provided by Marsh and Cope. Even at the time, authors such as <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Wendell Williston suggested that too many names had been coined. For example, Williston pointed out in 1901 that Marsh had never been able to adequately distinguish <i>Allosaurus</i> from <i>Creosaurus</i>. The most influential early attempt to sort out the convoluted situation was produced by <!--del_lnk--> Charles W. Gilmore in 1920. He came to the conclusion that the tail vertebra dubbed <i>Antrodemus</i> by Leidy was indistinguishable from those of <i>Allosaurus</i>, and <i>Antrodemus</i> thus should be the preferred name because as the older name it had priority. <i>Antrodemus</i> became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over fifty years, until James Madsen published on the Cleveland-Lloyd specimens and concluded that <i>Allosaurus</i> should be used because <i>Antrodemus</i> was based on material with poor, if any, diagnostic features and locality information (for example, the <!--del_lnk--> geological formation that the single bone of <i>Antrodemus</i> came from is unknown). "<i>Antrodemus</i>" has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull Gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by Madsen.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cleveland-Lloyd_discoveries">Cleveland-Lloyd discoveries</span></h3>
       <p>Although sporadic work at what became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in <!--del_lnk--> Emery County, <!--del_lnk--> Utah had taken place as early as 1927, and the fossil site itself described by William J. Stokes in 1945, major operations did not begin there until 1960. Under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40&nbsp;institutions, thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965. The quarry is notable for the predominance of <i>Allosaurus</i> remains, the condition of the specimens, and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be. The majority of bones belong to the large theropod <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i> (it is estimated that the remains of at least 46&nbsp;<i>A. fragilis</i> have been found there, out of at minimum 73&nbsp;dinosaurs), and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well-mixed. Nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the <!--del_lnk--> taphonomy of the site, suggesting numerous mutually-exclusive explanations for how it may have formed. Suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog, to becoming trapped in deep mud, to falling victim to <a href="../../wp/d/Drought.htm" title="Drought">drought</a>-induced mortality around a waterhole, to getting trapped in a spring-fed pond or seep. Regardless of the actual cause, the great quantity of well-preserved <i>Allosaurus</i> remains has allowed this genus to be known in detail, making it among the best-known theropods. Skeletal remains from the quarry pertain to individuals of almost all ages and sizes, from less than 1&nbsp;meter (3.3&nbsp;ft) to 12&nbsp;meters (39&nbsp;ft) long, and the disarticulation is an advantage for describing bones usually found fused.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_work:_1980s.E2.80.93present">Recent work: 1980s&ndash;present</span></h3>
       <p>The period since Madsen's monograph has been marked by a great expansion in studies dealing with topics concerning <i>Allosaurus</i> in life (<!--del_lnk--> paleobiological and <!--del_lnk--> paleoecological topics). Such studies have covered topics including skeletal variation, growth, skull construction, hunting methods, the <a href="../../wp/b/Brain.htm" title="Brain">brain</a>, and the possibility of gregarious living and parental care. Reanalysis of old material (particularly of large 'allosaur' specimens), new discoveries in Portugal, and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>One of the more significant <i>Allosaurus</i> finds was the 1991 discovery of "Big Al" (<!--del_lnk--> MOR 693), a 95%&nbsp;complete, partially articulated specimen that measured about 8&nbsp;meters (about 26&nbsp;ft) in length. MOR 693 was excavated near <!--del_lnk--> Shell, Wyoming, by a joint Museum of the Rockies and <!--del_lnk--> University of Wyoming Geological Museum team. This skeleton was discovered by a Swiss team, led by Kirby Siber. In 1996 the same team discovered a second <i>Allosaurus</i>, "Big Al Two", which is the best preserved skeleton of its kind to date.</p>
       <p>The completeness, preservation, and scientific importance of this skeleton gave "Big Al" its name; the individual itself was below the average size for <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i>, and was a subadult estimated at only 87%&nbsp;grown. The specimen was described by Breithaupt in 1996. 19 of its bones were broken or showed signs of <a href="../../wp/i/Infection.htm" title="Infection">infection</a>, which may have contributed to "Big Al's" death. <a href="../../wp/p/Pathology.htm" title="Pathology">Pathologic</a> bones included five ribs, five vertebrae, and four bones of the feet; several damaged bones showed <!--del_lnk--> osteomyelitis, a bone infection. A particular problem for the living animal was infection and trauma to the right foot that probably affected movement and may have also predisposed the other foot to injury because of a change in gait.</p>

       </div>
       <p>It is unclear how many species of <i>Allosaurus</i> there were. Seven species have been considered potentially valid since 1988 (<i>A. amplexus</i>, <i>A. atrox</i>, <i>A. europaeus</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> type species <i>A. fragilis</i>, the as-yet not formally described "A. jimmadseni", <i>A. maximus</i>, and <i>A. tendagurensis</i>), although only a fraction are usually considered valid at any given time. Additionally, there are at least ten dubious or undescribed species that have been assigned to <i>Allosaurus</i> over the years, along with the species belonging to genera now sunk into <i>Allosaurus</i>. In a recent review of basal <!--del_lnk--> tetanuran theropods, only <i>A. fragilis</i> (including <i>A. amplexus</i> and <i>A. atrox</i> as synonyms), "A. jimmadseni" (as an unnamed species), and <i>A. tendagurensis</i> were accepted as potentially valid species, with <i>A. europaeus</i> not yet proposed and <i>A. maximus</i> assigned to <i>Saurophaganax</i>.</p>
       <p><i>A. amplexus</i>, <i>A. atrox</i>, <i>A. fragilis</i>, "A. jimmadseni", and <i>A. maximus</i> are all known from remains discovered in the <!--del_lnk--> Kimmeridgian&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> Tithonian <!--del_lnk--> Upper Jurassic-age Morrison Formation of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, spread across the states of <!--del_lnk--> Colorado, <!--del_lnk--> Montana, <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico, <!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma, <!--del_lnk--> South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. <i>A. fragilis</i> is regarded as the most common, known from the remains of at least sixty individuals. Debate has gone on since the 1980s regarding the possibility that there are two common Morrison Formation species of <i>Allosaurus</i>, with the second known as <i>A. atrox</i>; recent work has followed a "one species" interpretation, with the differences seen in the Morrison Formation material attributed to individual variation. A study of skull elements from the Cleveland-Lloyd site found wide variation between individuals, calling into question previous species-level distinctions based such features as the shape of the lacrimal horns, and the proposed differentiation of "A. jimmadseni" based on the shape of the <!--del_lnk--> jugal. <i>A. europaeus</i> was found in the Kimmeridgian-age Porto Novo Member of the <!--del_lnk--> Lourinh&atilde; Formation, but may be the same as <i>A. fragilis</i>. <i>A. tendagurensis</i> was found in Kimmeridgian-age rocks of <!--del_lnk--> Tendaguru, in <!--del_lnk--> Mtwara, Tanzania. It may be a more basal tetanuran, a carcharodontosaurid, or simply a <!--del_lnk--> dubious theropod. Although obscure, it was a large theropod, possibly around 10&nbsp;meters long (33&nbsp;ft) and 2.5&nbsp;metric tons (2.8&nbsp;short tons) in weight.</p>

       <p><i>Allosaurus</i> is regarded as a probable synonym of the genera <i>Antrodemus</i>, <i>Creosaurus</i>, <i>Epanterias</i>, and <i>Labrosaurus</i>. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of <i>A. fragilis</i>, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is <i>Labrosaurus ferox</i>, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was <a href="../../wp/p/Pathology.htm" title="Pathology">pathologic</a>, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of <i>A. fragilis.</i> Other remains thought to pertain to <i>Allosaurus</i> have come from across the world, including <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Siberia, and <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, but these fossils have been reassessed as belonging to other dinosaurs.</p>
       <p>The issue of synonyms is complicated by the <!--del_lnk--> type specimen of <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i> (catalog number <!--del_lnk--> YPM&nbsp;1930) being extremely fragmentary, consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae, limb bone fragments, rib fragments, and a tooth. Because of this, several scientists have interpreted the type specimen as potentially dubious, and thus the genus <i>Allosaurus</i> itself or at least the species <i>A. fragilis</i> would be a <i>nomen dubium</i> ("dubious name", based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify). To address this situation, <!--del_lnk--> Gregory S. Paul and <!--del_lnk--> Kenneth Carpenter (2010) submitted a petition to the <!--del_lnk--> ICZN to have the name <i>A. fragilis</i> officially transferred to the more complete specimen USNM4734 (as a <!--del_lnk--> neotype). This request is currently pending review.</p>

       <p><i>Allosaurus</i> was the most common large theropod in the vast tract of <!--del_lnk--> Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the <!--del_lnk--> Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top <!--del_lnk--> trophic level of the Morrison <!--del_lnk--> food web. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a <!--del_lnk--> semiarid environment with distinct <!--del_lnk--> wet and <!--del_lnk--> dry seasons, and flat <!--del_lnk--> floodplains. Vegetation varied from <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">river</a>-lining forests of <!--del_lnk--> conifers, <!--del_lnk--> tree ferns, and <a href="../../wp/f/Fern.htm" title="Fern">ferns</a> (<!--del_lnk--> gallery forests), to fern <!--del_lnk--> savannas with occasional trees such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Araucaria</i>-like conifer <i><!--del_lnk--> Brachyphyllum</i>.</p>
       <p>The Morrison Formation has been a rich fossil hunting ground. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of <!--del_lnk--> green algae, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Moss.htm" title="Moss">mosses</a>, <!--del_lnk--> horsetails, ferns, <!--del_lnk--> cycads, <!--del_lnk--> ginkgoes, and several families of <!--del_lnk--> conifers. Animal fossils discovered include <!--del_lnk--> bivalves, <!--del_lnk--> snails, <!--del_lnk--> ray-finned fishes, <a href="../../wp/f/Frog.htm" title="Frog">frogs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> salamanders, <a href="../../wp/t/Turtle.htm" title="Turtle">turtles</a>, <!--del_lnk--> sphenodonts, <a href="../../wp/l/Lizard.htm" title="Lizard">lizards</a>, terrestrial and aquatic <!--del_lnk--> crocodylomorphans, several species of <a href="../../wp/p/Pterosaur.htm" title="Pterosaur">pterosaur</a>, numerous dinosaur species, and early <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a> such as <!--del_lnk--> docodonts, <!--del_lnk--> multituberculates, <!--del_lnk--> symmetrodonts, and <!--del_lnk--> triconodonts.

It is commonly found at the same sites as <i>Apatosaurus</i>, <i>Camarasaurus</i>, <i>Diplodocus</i>, and <i>Stegosaurus</i>. The Late Jurassic formations of Portugal where <i>Allosaurus</i> is present are interpreted as having been similar to the Morrison but with a stronger <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">marine</a> influence. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks (mainly <i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, <i>Torvosaurus</i>, and <i>Apatosaurus</i>), or have a close counterpart (<i>Brachiosaurus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Lusotitan</i>, <i>Camptosaurus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Draconyx</i>).</p>

       </div>
       <p><i>Allosaurus</i> coexisted with fellow large theropods <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and <i>Torvosaurus</i> in both the United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had different <!--del_lnk--> ecological niches, based on anatomy and the location of fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, better known than <i>Torvosaurus</i>, differed noticeably from <i>Allosaurus</i> in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. <i>Allosaurus</i> was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an <i>Allosaurus</i> <!--del_lnk--> pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably <i>Ceratosaurus</i> or <i>Torvosaurus</i>. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the <i>Allosaurus</i> was being scavenged.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Life_history">Life history</span></h3>
       <p>The wealth of <i>Allosaurus</i> fossils, from nearly all ages of individuals, allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been. Remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as <!--del_lnk--> eggs&mdash;crushed eggs from Colorado have been suggested as those of <i>Allosaurus</i>. Based on <!--del_lnk--> histological analysis of limb bones, the upper age limit for <i>Allosaurus</i> is estimated at 22 to 28&nbsp;years, which is comparable to that of other large theropods like <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tyrannosaurus.htm" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a></i>. From the same analysis, its maximum growth appears to have been at age&nbsp;15, with an estimated growth rate of about 150&nbsp;kilograms (330&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> lb) per year.</p>
       <p>Medullary bone tissue, also found in dinosaurs as diverse as <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tyrannosaurus.htm" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a></i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Tenontosaurus</i>, has been found in at least one <i>Allosaurus</i> specimen, a <!--del_lnk--> shin bone from the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a> to shells. Its presence in the <i>Allosaurus</i> individual establishes sex and shows she had reached reproductive age. By counting growth lines, it was shown that she was 10&nbsp;years old at death, so sexual maturity in <i>Allosaurus</i> was attained well before maximum growth and size.</p>
       <p>The discovery of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger <i>Allosaurus</i> were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, and the growth of the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown <!--del_lnk--> isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Paleontologists accept <i>Allosaurus</i> as an active predator of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on <i>Stegosaurus</i>, including an <i>Allosaurus</i> tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a <i>Stegosaurus</i> <!--del_lnk--> tail spike, and a <i>Stegosaurus</i> neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an <i>Allosaurus</i> snout. <!--del_lnk--> Sauropods seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of <!--del_lnk--> scavenging, based on the presence of scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones. However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988, <i>Allosaurus</i> was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods. Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults. Research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question. <!--del_lnk--> Robert T. Bakker, comparing <i>Allosaurus</i> to <!--del_lnk--> Cenozoic sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although <i>Allosaurus</i> did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a <!--del_lnk--> saw-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Similar conclusions were drawn by another study using <!--del_lnk--> finite element analysis on an <i>Allosaurus</i> skull. According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 2,148&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> N, less than the values for <a href="../../wp/a/Alligator.htm" title="Alligator">alligators</a> (13,000&nbsp;N), <a href="../../wp/l/Lion.htm" title="Lion">lions</a> (4,167&nbsp;N), and <!--del_lnk--> leopards (2,268&nbsp;N), but the skull could withstand nearly 55,500&nbsp;N of vertical force against the tooth row. The authors suggested that <i>Allosaurus</i> used its skull like a hatchet against prey, attacking open-mouthed, slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without splintering bones, unlike <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones. They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods. Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey. The original authors noted that <i>Allosaurus</i> itself has no modern equivalent, that the tooth row is well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the <!--del_lnk--> palate and lessen stress. Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like <i>Allosaurus</i> were "flesh grazers" which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright. This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later. An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea. This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey.</p>

       <p>Other aspects of feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The shape of the skull of <i>Allosaurus</i> limited potential <!--del_lnk--> binocular vision to 20&deg; of width, slightly less than that of modern <!--del_lnk--> crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of <i>Allosaurus</i> has been estimated at 30 to 55&nbsp;kilometers per hour (19 to 34&nbsp;miles per hour).</p>

       </div>
       <p>It has been speculated since the 1970s that <i>Allosaurus</i> preyed on sauropods and other large dinosaurs by hunting in groups. Such a depiction is common in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behaviour in theropods, and social interactions with members of the same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named <i>Labrosaurus ferox</i> is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a <!--del_lnk--> pack or to settle <!--del_lnk--> territorial disputes.</p>
       <p>Although <i>Allosaurus</i> may have hunted in packs, it has been argued that <i>Allosaurus</i> and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among <a href="../../wp/v/Vertebrate.htm" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a> in general, and modern <!--del_lnk--> diapsid carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) very rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and <!--del_lnk--> cannibalize intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple <i>Allosaurus</i> individuals at the same site, e.g. in the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland&ndash;Lloyd Quarry, are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that <i>Allosaurus</i> individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like <a href="../../wp/c/Crocodile.htm" title="Crocodile">crocodiles</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Komodo dragons. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites. There is some evidence for cannibalism in <i>Allosaurus</i>, including <i>Allosaurus</i> shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a <!--del_lnk--> shoulder blade, and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Brain_and_senses">Brain and senses</span></h3>
       <p>The brain of <i>Allosaurus</i>, as interpreted from spiral <!--del_lnk--> CT scanning of an <!--del_lnk--> endocast, was more consistent with <!--del_lnk--> crocodilian brains than those of the other living <!--del_lnk--> archosaurs, birds. The structure of the <!--del_lnk--> vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the <!--del_lnk--> inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so <i>Allosaurus</i> probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The <!--del_lnk--> olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odours, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.</p>

       <p>In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for <!--del_lnk--> stress fractures and <!--del_lnk--> tendon avulsions in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropod">theropod</a> dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioural significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or <!--del_lnk--> migration, resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. <i>Allosaurus</i> was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that <i>Allosaurus</i> had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than <i><a href="../../wp/a/Albertosaurus.htm" title="Albertosaurus">Albertosaurus</a></i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Ornithomimus</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> Archaeornithomimus</i>. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones "were distributed to the <!--del_lnk--> proximal <!--del_lnk--> phalanges" and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in "statistically indistinguishable" numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined <i>Allosaurus</i> fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in <i>Allosaurus</i> provide evidence for "very active" predation-based rather than scavenging diets.</p>
       <p>The left <!--del_lnk--> scapula and <!--del_lnk--> fibula of an <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Allosaurus.htm" title="Allosaurus fragilis">Allosaurus fragilis</a></i> specimen catalogued as USNM 4734 are both pathological, both probably due to healed fractures. The specimen USNM 8367 preserved several pathological gastralia which preserve evidence of healed fractures near their middle. Some of the fractures were poorly healed and "formed pseudoarthroses." A specimen with a fractured rib was recovered from the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Another specimen had fractured ribs and fused vertebrae near the end of the tail. An apparent subadult male <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Allosaurus.htm" title="Allosaurus fragilis">Allosaurus fragilis</a></i> was reported to have extensive pathologies, with a total of fourteen separate injuries.

       <p>Along with <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tyrannosaurus.htm" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a></i>, <i>Allosaurus</i> has come to represent the quintessential large, carnivorous dinosaur in popular culture. It is a common dinosaur in museums, due in particular to the excavations at the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry; by 1976, as a result of cooperative operations, 38&nbsp;museums in eight countries on three continents had Cleveland-Lloyd allosaur material or casts. <i>Allosaurus</i> is the official <!--del_lnk--> state fossil of <!--del_lnk--> Utah.</p>
       <p><i>Allosaurus</i> has been depicted in popular culture since the early years of the 20th century. It is top predator in both <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Lost World</i>, and its <!--del_lnk--> 1925 film adaptation, the first full-length motion picture to feature dinosaurs. <i>Allosaurus</i> was used as the starring dinosaur of the 1956 film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Beast of Hollow Mountain</i>, and the 1969 film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Valley of Gwangi</i>, two <!--del_lnk--> genre combinations of living dinosaurs with <!--del_lnk--> Westerns. In <i>The Valley of Gwangi</i>, Gwangi is billed as an <i>Allosaurus</i>, although <!--del_lnk--> Ray Harryhausen based his model for the creature on Charles R. Knight's depiction of a <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. Harryhausen sometimes confuses the two, stating in a DVD interview "They're both meat eaters, they're both tyrants... one was just a bit larger than the other." <i>Allosaurus</i> appeared in the second episode of the 1999 <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Walking with Dinosaurs</i> and the follow-up special <i><!--del_lnk--> The Ballad of Big Al</i>, which speculated on the life of the "Big Al" specimen, based on scientific evidence from the numerous injuries and pathologies in its skeleton. <i>Allosaurus</i> also made an appearance in the Discovery Channel series <i><!--del_lnk--> Dinosaur Revolution</i>. Its depiction in this series was based upon a specimen with a smashed lower jaw that was uncovered by paleontologist <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Holtz.</p>
