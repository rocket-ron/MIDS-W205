       <p><b>Sir Alexander Chapman "Alex" Ferguson</b>, <small><!--del_lnk--> CBE</small> (born 31 December 1941) is a <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> <!--del_lnk--> football manager and former <!--del_lnk--> player who has managed <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester_United_F.C..htm" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> since 1986. His time at the club has led to Ferguson being one of the most admired and respected managers in the history of the game.</p>
       <p>Ferguson managed <!--del_lnk--> East Stirlingshire and <!--del_lnk--> St. Mirren before a highly successful period as manager of <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen. After briefly managing <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland_national_football_team.htm" title="Scotland national football team">Scotland</a> following the death of <!--del_lnk--> Jock Stein, he was appointed manager of <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester_United_F.C..htm" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> in November 1986.</p>
       <p>Ferguson is the longest serving manager of <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester_United_F.C..htm" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a>, overtaking <!--del_lnk--> Sir Matt Busby's record on 19 December 2010, and the longest serving of all <!--del_lnk--> current League managers. He has won many awards and holds many records including winning <!--del_lnk--> Manager of the Year most times in British football history. In 2008, he became the third British manager to win the <!--del_lnk--> European Cup on more than one occasion. He was knighted in 1999 for his services to the game and also holds the <!--del_lnk--> Freedom of the City of Aberdeen.</p>
       <p>On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced his retirement as manager of Manchester United. During his 26 years at the club, he won 38 trophies, including 13 <a href="../../wp/p/Premier_League.htm" title="Premier League">Premier League</a> titles, and the <a href="../../wp/u/UEFA_Champions_League.htm" title="UEFA Champions League">UEFA Champions League</a> twice.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
       <p>Born to Alexander Beaton Ferguson, a plater's helper in the shipbuilding industry, and his wife, the former Elizabeth Hardie, Alex Ferguson was born at his grandmother's home on Shieldhall Road, <!--del_lnk--> Govan, on 31 December 1941, but grew up in a tenement at 667 Govan Road which has since been demolished where he lived with his parents as well as his younger brother <!--del_lnk--> Martin.</p>
       <p>He attended <!--del_lnk--> Broomloan Road Primary School and later <!--del_lnk--> Govan High School, and supported <a href="../../wp/r/Rangers_F.C..htm" title="Rangers F.C.">Rangers</a>.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Playing_career">Playing career</span></h2>
       <p>Ferguson's playing career began as an amateur with <!--del_lnk--> Queen's Park, where he made his debut as a <!--del_lnk--> striker aged 16. He described his first match as a "nightmare", but scored Queen's Park's goal in a 2&ndash;1 defeat against <!--del_lnk--> Stranraer. Perhaps his most notable game for Queen's Park was the 7&ndash;1 defeat away to <!--del_lnk--> Queen of the South on <!--del_lnk--> Boxing Day 1959 when ex-England international <!--del_lnk--> Ivor Broadis scored four of the Queen of the South goals. Ferguson was the solitary Queen's Park goalscorer.</p>
       <p>Despite scoring 20 <!--del_lnk--> goals in his 31 games for Queen's Park, he could not command a regular place in the side and moved to <!--del_lnk--> St. Johnstone in 1960. Although he continued to score regularly at St. Johnstone, he was still unable to command a regular place and regularly requested transfers. Ferguson was out of favour at the club and he even considered emigrating to Canada, however St. Johnstone's failure to sign a forward led the manager to select Ferguson for a match against Rangers, in which he scored a <!--del_lnk--> hat trick in a surprise victory. <!--del_lnk--> Dunfermline signed him the following summer (1964), and Ferguson became a full-time professional footballer.</p>
       <p>The following season (1964&ndash;65), Dunfermline were strong challengers for the Scottish League and reached the Scottish Cup Final, but Ferguson was dropped for the final after a poor performance in a league game against St. Johnstone. Dunfermline lost the final 3&ndash;2 to Celtic, then failed to win the League by one point. The 1965&ndash;66 season saw Ferguson notch up 45 goals in 51 games for Dunfermline. Along with <!--del_lnk--> Joe McBride of Celtic, he was the top goalscorer in the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish League with 31 goals.</p>
       <p>He then joined Rangers for &pound;65,000, then a record fee for a transfer between two Scottish clubs. He was blamed for a goal that they conceded in the <!--del_lnk--> 1969 Scottish Cup Final, in a match in which he was designated to mark <a href="../../wp/c/Celtic_F.C..htm" title="Celtic F.C.">Celtic</a> <!--del_lnk--> captain, <!--del_lnk--> Billy McNeill, and was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side instead of for the first team. According to his brother, Ferguson was so upset by the experience that he threw his losers' medal away. There have been claims that he suffered discrimination at Rangers after his marriage to a Catholic, Cathy Holding, but Ferguson himself makes it clear in his autobiography that Rangers knew of his wife's religion when he joined the club and that he left the club very reluctantly, due to the fall-out from his alleged cup final mistake.</p>
       <p>The following October, <!--del_lnk--> Nottingham Forest wanted to sign Ferguson, but his wife was not keen on moving to England at that time so he went to <!--del_lnk--> Falkirk instead. He was promoted to player-coach there, but when <!--del_lnk--> John Prentice became manager he removed Ferguson's coaching responsibilities. Ferguson responded by requesting a transfer and moved to <!--del_lnk--> Ayr United, where he finished his playing career in 1974.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_managerial_career">Early managerial career</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="East_Stirlingshire">East Stirlingshire</span></h3>
       <p>In June 1974, Ferguson was appointed manager of <!--del_lnk--> East Stirlingshire, at the comparatively young age of 32. It was a part-time job that paid &pound;40 per week, and the club did not have a single <!--del_lnk--> goalkeeper at the time. He gained a reputation as a disciplinarian
       <p>The following October, Ferguson was invited to manage <!--del_lnk--> St. Mirren. While they were below <!--del_lnk--> East Stirlingshire in the league, they were a bigger club and although Ferguson felt a degree of loyalty towards East Stirlingshire, he decided to join <!--del_lnk--> St. Mirren after taking advice from <!--del_lnk--> Jock Stein.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="St._Mirren">St. Mirren</span></h3>
       <p>Ferguson was manager of St. Mirren from 1974 until 1978, producing a remarkable transformation of a team in the lower half of the old <!--del_lnk--> Second Division watched by crowds of just over 1,000, to <!--del_lnk--> First Division champions in <!--del_lnk--> 1977, discovering talent like <!--del_lnk--> Billy Stark, <!--del_lnk--> Tony Fitzpatrick, <!--del_lnk--> Lex Richardson, <!--del_lnk--> Frank McGarvey, Bobby Reid and <!--del_lnk--> Peter Weir while playing superb attacking football. The average age of the league winning team was 19 and the captain, Fitzpatrick, was 20.</p>
       <p>St. Mirren have the distinction of being the only club ever to sack Ferguson. He claimed wrongful dismissal against the club at an industrial tribunal but lost and was given no leave to appeal. According to a Billy Adams <i><!--del_lnk--> Sunday Herald</i> article on 30 May 1999, the official version is that Ferguson was sacked for various breaches of contract including unauthorised payments to players. He was counter-accused of intimidating behaviour towards his office secretary because he wanted players to get some expenses tax free. He didn't speak to her for six weeks, confiscated her keys and communicated only through a 17-year-old assistant. The tribunal concluded that Ferguson was "particularly petty" and "immature". It was claimed during the tribunal by St. Mirren chairman, <!--del_lnk--> Willie Todd, that Ferguson had "no managerial ability".</p>
       <p>On 31 May 2008, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Guardian</i> published an interview with Todd (then aged 87), who had sacked Ferguson all those years earlier. He explained that the fundamental reason for the dismissal was a breach of contract relating to Ferguson having agreed to join Aberdeen. Ferguson told journalist Jim Rodger of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daily Mirror</i> that he had asked at least one member of the squad to go to Aberdeen with him. He also told the St. Mirren staff he was leaving. Todd expressed regret over what happened but blamed Aberdeen for not approaching his club to discuss compensation.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Late_1970s">Late 1970s</span></h3>
       <p>Ferguson joined Aberdeen as manager in June 1978, replacing <!--del_lnk--> Billy McNeill who had only managed the club for one season before he was offered the chance to manage <a href="../../wp/c/Celtic_F.C..htm" title="Celtic F.C.">Celtic</a>. Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in <!--del_lnk--> 1955 under <!--del_lnk--> Dave Halliday. The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season. Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as <!--del_lnk--> Joe Harper. The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Cup and the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league.</p>
       <p>Aberdeen also lost the <!--del_lnk--> 1979&ndash;80 Scottish League Cup Final, this time to <a href="../../wp/d/Dundee_United_F.C..htm" title="Dundee United F.C.">Dundee United</a> after a replay. Ferguson took the blame for the defeat, saying he should have made changes to the team for the replay.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1980s_and_silverware">1980s and silverware</span></h3>
       <p>Aberdeen had started the season poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5&ndash;0 win on the final day. It was the first time in fifteen years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or <a href="../../wp/c/Celtic_F.C..htm" title="Celtic F.C.">Celtic</a>. Ferguson now felt that he had the respect of his players, later saying "That was the achievement which united us. I finally had the players believing in me".</p>
       <p>He was still a strict disciplinarian, though, and his players nicknamed him <i>Furious Fergie</i>. He fined one of his players, <!--del_lnk--> John Hewitt, for overtaking him on a public road, and kicked a tea urn at the players at half time after a poor first half. He was dissatisfied with the atmosphere at Aberdeen matches, and deliberately created a '<!--del_lnk--> siege mentality' by accusing the Scottish media of being biased towards the Glasgow clubs, in order to motivate the team. The team continued their success with a Scottish Cup win in 1982. Ferguson was offered the managers' job at <!--del_lnk--> Wolves but turned it down as he felt that Wolves were in trouble and "[his] ambitions at Aberdeen were not even half fulfilled".</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="European_success">European success</span></h3>
       <p>Ferguson led Aberdeen to even greater success the following season (1982&ndash;83). They had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup as a result of winning the Scottish Cup the previous season, and impressively knocked out <!--del_lnk--> Bayern Munich, who had beaten <a href="../../wp/t/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C..htm" title="Tottenham Hotspur F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> 4&ndash;1 in the previous round. According to <!--del_lnk--> Willie Miller, this gave them the confidence to believe that they could go on to win the competition, which they did, with a 2&ndash;1 victory over <!--del_lnk--> Real Madrid in the final on 11 May 1983. Aberdeen became only the third Scottish team to win a European trophy and Ferguson now felt that "he'd done something worthwhile with his life". Aberdeen had also performed well in the league that season, and retained the Scottish Cup with a 1&ndash;0 victory over Rangers, but Ferguson was not happy with his team's play in that match and upset the players by describing theirs as a "disgraceful performance" in a televised interview after the match, a statement he later retracted.</p>
       <p>After a sub-standard start to the <!--del_lnk--> 1983&ndash;84 season, Aberdeen's form improved and the team won the Scottish league and retained the Scottish Cup. Ferguson was appointed an Officer of the <!--del_lnk--> Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1984 honours list, and was offered the managers' jobs at Rangers, <a href="../../wp/a/Arsenal_F.C..htm" title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C..htm" title="Tottenham Hotspur F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> during the season. Aberdeen retained their league title in the 1984&ndash;85 season, but had a disappointing season in 1985&ndash;86, finishing fourth in the league, although they did win both domestic cups. Ferguson had been appointed to the club's board of directors early in 1986, but that April he told Dick Donald, their chairman, that he intended to leave that summer.</p>
       <p>Ferguson had been part of coaching staff for the <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland_national_football_team.htm" title="Scotland national football team">Scottish national side</a> during qualifying for the <!--del_lnk--> 1986 World Cup, but manager <!--del_lnk--> Jock Stein had <!--del_lnk--> collapsed and died on 10 September 1985 &ndash; at the end of the game in which Scotland qualified from their group for a play-off against <!--del_lnk--> Australia. Ferguson promptly agreed to take charge of the Scottish national side against the Australians and subsequently at the World Cup. To allow him to fulfil his international duties he appointed <!--del_lnk--> Archie Knox as his co-manager at Aberdeen. However, after Scotland failed to progress past the group stages of the World Cup, Ferguson stepped down as national team manager on 15 June 1986.</p>
       <p>Around this time, <a href="../../wp/t/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C..htm" title="Tottenham Hotspur F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> offered Ferguson the chance to take over from <!--del_lnk--> Peter Shreeves as manager, but he rejected this offer and the job went to <!--del_lnk--> Luton Town's <!--del_lnk--> David Pleat instead. There was also an offer for Ferguson to replace <!--del_lnk--> Don Howe as Arsenal manager, but he rejected this offer as well, and fellow Scot <!--del_lnk--> George Graham took the post instead. That summer, there had been speculation that he would take over from <!--del_lnk--> Ron Atkinson at <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester_United_F.C..htm" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a>, who had slumped to fourth in the English top flight after a ten-match winning start had made title glory seem inevitable.</p>
       <p>It was not the first time that Ferguson had been linked with a move to England. In February 1982, <!--del_lnk--> Wolverhampton Wanderers had approached him about succeeding <!--del_lnk--> John Barnwell as manager as they were heading for relegation from the First Division. He rejected this offer, perhaps concerned about the club's financial stability, as they were more than &pound;2million in debt at the time and narrowly avoided going out of business. At the end of the <!--del_lnk--> 1984&ndash;85 season, it was reported that Ferguson was being considered for the <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool_F.C..htm" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool</a> manager's job after the retirement of <!--del_lnk--> Joe Fagan was announced, but the job was quickly accepted by Liverpool striker <!--del_lnk--> Kenny Dalglish.</p>
       <p>At the end of the <!--del_lnk--> 1985&ndash;86 season, both Arsenal and <a href="../../wp/t/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C..htm" title="Tottenham Hotspur F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> had approached him about becoming their new manager, but he rejected the offers from both <!--del_lnk--> North London clubs.</p>
       <p>Ferguson had also been approached for the <a href="../../wp/r/Rangers_F.C..htm" title="Rangers F.C.">Rangers</a> job in October 1983, but also rejected this offer.</p>
       <p>Although Ferguson remained at Aberdeen over the summer, he did eventually join Manchester United when Atkinson was sacked in November 1986.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Managing_Manchester_United">Managing Manchester United</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Appointment_and_first_years">Appointment and first years</span></h3>
       <p>Ferguson was appointed manager at <!--del_lnk--> Old Trafford on 6 November 1986. He was initially worried that many of the players, such as <!--del_lnk--> Norman Whiteside, <!--del_lnk--> Paul McGrath and <!--del_lnk--> Bryan Robson were drinking too much and was "depressed" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over.</p>
       <p>His first game in charge was a 2&ndash;0 defeat at underdogs <!--del_lnk--> Oxford United on 8 November, followed seven days later by a goalless draw at newly promoted <!--del_lnk--> Norwich City, and then his first win (1&ndash;0 at home to <!--del_lnk--> QPR) on 22 November. Results steadily improved as the season went on, and by the time they recorded what would be their only away win of the league campaign at title challengers and deadly rivals Liverpool on <!--del_lnk--> Boxing Day, it was clear that United were on the road to recovery. 1987 began on a high note with a 4&ndash;1 victory over <a href="../../wp/n/Newcastle_United_F.C..htm" title="Newcastle United F.C.">Newcastle United</a> and United gradually pulled together in the second half of the season, with relatively occasional defeats on the way, and finished 11th in the final table. Ferguson's mother, Elizabeth died of lung cancer, aged 64, three weeks after his appointment. Ferguson appointed <!--del_lnk--> Archie Knox, his assistant at Aberdeen, as his assistant at Manchester United in 1986.</p>
       <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1987&ndash;88 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including <!--del_lnk--> Steve Bruce, <!--del_lnk--> Viv Anderson, <!--del_lnk--> Brian McClair and <!--del_lnk--> Jim Leighton. The new players made a great contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. However, Liverpool's points lead had been in double digits for most of the season and while United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games and there was clearly still some way to go before United could be a match for their north western rivals.</p>
       <p>United were expected to do well when <!--del_lnk--> Mark Hughes returned to the club two years after leaving for <!--del_lnk--> Barcelona, but the <!--del_lnk--> 1988&ndash;89 season was a disappointment for them, finishing eleventh in the league and losing 1&ndash;0 at home to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup Sixth Round. They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match winless run throughout October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results took them to third place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of disappointing results in the final quarter of the season saw them fall down to mid table.</p>
       <p>During the season, United played in friendly matches against the <!--del_lnk--> Bermudan national team and <!--del_lnk--> Somerset County Cricket Club as part of the Bermudan team's tour of England. In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant, Archie Knox, took to the field, with Knox even getting on the scoresheet. The match remains Ferguson's only appearance for the Manchester United first team.</p>
       <p>For the <!--del_lnk--> 1989&ndash;90 season, Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders <!--del_lnk--> Neil Webb, <!--del_lnk--> Mike Phelan and <!--del_lnk--> Paul Ince, as well as defender <!--del_lnk--> Gary Pallister and winger <!--del_lnk--> Danny Wallace. The season began well with a 4&ndash;1 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United's league form quickly turned sour. In September, United suffered a humiliating 5&ndash;1 away defeat against <!--del_lnk--> fierce rivals <!--del_lnk--> Manchester City.  Ferguson later described December 1989 as "the darkest period [he had] ever suffered in the game", as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone.</p>
       <p>However, Ferguson later revealed that the board of directors had assured him that they were not considering dismissing him. Although naturally disappointed with the lack of success in the league, they understood the reasons for the sub-standard results (namely the absence of several key players due to injury) and were pleased with the way that Ferguson had reorganised the club's coaching and scouting system.</p>
       <p>Following a run of seven games without a win, Manchester United were drawn away to <!--del_lnk--> Nottingham Forest in the third round of the <a href="../../wp/f/FA_Cup.htm" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a>. Forest were performing well that season and were in the process of winning the League Cup for the second season running, and it was expected that United would lose the match and Ferguson would consequently be sacked, but United won the game 1&ndash;0 thanks to a <!--del_lnk--> Mark Robins goal and eventually reached the final. This cup win is often cited as the match that saved Ferguson's Old Trafford career, even though it has since been stated that his job was never at risk. United went on to win the FA Cup, beating <!--del_lnk--> Crystal Palace 1&ndash;0 in the final replay after a 3&ndash;3 draw in the first match, giving Ferguson his first major trophy as Manchester United manager. United's defensive frailties in the first match were unilaterally blamed on goalkeeper <!--del_lnk--> Jim Leighton, forcing Ferguson to drop his former Aberdeen player and bring in <!--del_lnk--> Les Sealey.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Although United's league form improved greatly in <!--del_lnk--> 1990&ndash;91, they were still inconsistent and finished sixth. There were some excellent performances that season, including a 6&ndash;2 demolition of Arsenal at <!--del_lnk--> Highbury, but results like an early 2&ndash;1 loss at newly promoted <!--del_lnk--> Sunderland, a 4&ndash;0 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2&ndash;0 home defeat by <!--del_lnk--> Everton in early March (the game where 17-year-old hot prospect <a href="../../wp/r/Ryan_Giggs.htm" title="Ryan Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> made his senior debut) showed that United still had some way to go.</p>
       <p>Even after the FA Cup Final victory in the previous season, some still had doubts about Ferguson's ability to succeed where all the other managers since <!--del_lnk--> Busby had failed&nbsp;&mdash; to win the league title. They were runners-up in the <!--del_lnk--> League Cup, losing 1&ndash;0 to <!--del_lnk--> Sheffield Wednesday. They also reached the final of the <!--del_lnk--> European Cup Winners' Cup, beating that season's Spanish champions <!--del_lnk--> Barcelona 2&ndash;1. After the match, Ferguson vowed that United would win the league the following season, and at long last he seemed to have won over the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job.</p>
       <p>During the 1991 close season, Ferguson's assistant Archie Knox departed to <a href="../../wp/r/Rangers_F.C..htm" title="Rangers F.C.">Glasgow Rangers</a> to become assistant to <!--del_lnk--> Walter Smith, and Ferguson promoted youth team coach <!--del_lnk--> Brian Kidd to the role of assistant manager in Knox's place. He also made two major signings &ndash; goalkeeper <!--del_lnk--> Peter Schmeichel and defender <!--del_lnk--> Paul Parker &ndash; to bolster his side. There was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990&ndash;91 campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of <!--del_lnk--> Lee Sharpe, who despite their youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a new player to take over from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added the <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> <!--del_lnk--> Andrei Kanchelskis to the right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older right footed midfielders <!--del_lnk--> Mike Phelan and Bryan Robson.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 1991&ndash;92 season did not live up to Ferguson's expectations and, in Ferguson's words, "many in the media felt that [his] mistakes had contributed to the misery". United won the <!--del_lnk--> League Cup and <!--del_lnk--> Super Cup for the first time, but lost out on the <!--del_lnk--> league title to rivals <!--del_lnk--> Leeds United after leading the table for much of the season. A shortage of goals and being held to draws by teams they had been expected to beat in the second half of the campaign had proved to be the undoing of a United side who had performed so well in the first half of the season. Ferguson felt that his failure to secure the signing of <!--del_lnk--> Mick Harford from <!--del_lnk--> Luton Town had cost United the league, and that he needed "an extra dimension" to the team if they were to win the league the following season.</p>
       <p>During the 1992 close season, Ferguson went on the hunt for a new striker. He first attempted to sign <!--del_lnk--> Alan Shearer from <!--del_lnk--> Southampton, but lost out to <!--del_lnk--> Blackburn Rovers. He also made at least one approach for the <!--del_lnk--> Sheffield Wednesday striker <!--del_lnk--> David Hirst, but manager <!--del_lnk--> Trevor Francis rejected all offers and the player stayed put. In the end, he paid &pound;1&nbsp;million for 23-year-old <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge United striker <!--del_lnk--> Dion Dublin &ndash; his only major signing of the summer.</p>
       <p>After a slow start to the <!--del_lnk--> 1992&ndash;93 season (they were 10th of 22 at the beginning of November) it looked as though United would miss out on the league title (now the <a href="../../wp/p/Premier_League.htm" title="Premier League">Premier League</a>) yet again. However, after the purchase of French striker <!--del_lnk--> Eric Cantona from <!--del_lnk--> Leeds United for &pound;1.2&nbsp;million, the future of Manchester United, and Ferguson's position as manager, began to look bright. Cantona formed a strong partnership with Mark Hughes and fired the club to the top of the table, ending United's 26-year wait for a League Championship, and also making them the first ever <!--del_lnk--> Premier League Champions. United had finished champions with a 10-point margin over runners-up <!--del_lnk--> Aston Villa, whose 1&ndash;0 defeat at <!--del_lnk--> Oldham on 2 May 1993 had given United the title. Ferguson was voted Manager of the Year by the League Managers' Association.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Two_doubles">Two doubles</span></h3>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 1993&ndash;94 season brought more success. Ferguson added Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder <!--del_lnk--> Roy Keane to the ranks for a British record fee of &pound;3.75million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end of his career.</p>
       <p>United led the 1993&ndash;94 Premier League table virtually from start to finish.</p>
       <p>Ferguson was the very first winner of the <!--del_lnk--> Premier League Manager of the Month award, introduced for the start of the 1993&ndash;94 season, when he collected the accolade for August 1993.</p>
       <p>Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being <!--del_lnk--> sent off twice in the space of five days in March 1994. United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3&ndash;1 to Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, <!--del_lnk--> Ron Atkinson. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4&ndash;0 scoreline against <a href="../../wp/c/Chelsea_F.C..htm" title="Chelsea F.C.">Chelsea</a>, winning Ferguson his second <!--del_lnk--> League and Cup Double, following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984&ndash;85, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983.</p>
       <p>Ferguson made only one close-season signing, paying <!--del_lnk--> Blackburn Rovers &pound;1.2million for <!--del_lnk--> David May. There were newspaper reports that Ferguson was also going to sign highly rated 21-year-old striker <!--del_lnk--> Chris Sutton from Norwich City, but the player headed for Blackburn Rovers instead.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> 1994&ndash;95 was a harder season for Ferguson. Cantona assaulted a <!--del_lnk--> Crystal Palace supporter in a game at <!--del_lnk--> Selhurst Park, and it seemed likely he would leave English football. An eight-month ban saw Cantona miss the final four months of the season. He also received a 14-day prison sentence for the offence but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a 120-hour community service order. On the brighter side, United paid a British record fee of &pound;7million for <a href="../../wp/n/Newcastle_United_F.C..htm" title="Newcastle United F.C.">Newcastle's</a> prolific striker <!--del_lnk--> Andy Cole, with young winger <!--del_lnk--> Keith Gillespie heading to the north-east in exchange. The season also saw the breakthrough of young players Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who provided excellent cover for the long periods that United were left without some of their more experienced stars.</p>
       <p>However, the championship slipped out of Manchester United's grasp as they drew 1&ndash;1 with <!--del_lnk--> West Ham United on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them the a third successive league title. United also lost the FA Cup final in a 1&ndash;0 defeat to <!--del_lnk--> Everton.</p>
       <p>Ferguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought. First <!--del_lnk--> Paul Ince moved to <!--del_lnk--> Internazionale of Italy for &pound;7.5&nbsp;million, long serving striker Mark Hughes was suddenly sold to Chelsea in a &pound;1.5&nbsp;million deal, and <!--del_lnk--> Andrei Kanchelskis was sold to Everton.</p>
       <p>Ferguson made an approach for <a href="../../wp/t/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C..htm" title="Tottenham Hotspur F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> winger <!--del_lnk--> Darren Anderton, but the player signed a new contract with the <!--del_lnk--> North London club. He then made a bid to sign <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutchman</a> <!--del_lnk--> Marc Overmars from <!--del_lnk--> Ajax (the <a href="../../wp/u/UEFA_Champions_League.htm" title="UEFA Champions League">European Cup</a> winners), but the player suffered a serious knee injury and was ruled out for months. Media reports suggested that United were going to make an approach for <!--del_lnk--> Juventus and <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> forward <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Baggio, who was generally regarded as the best player in the world at this time, but the player remained in his homeland and signed for <!--del_lnk--> Milan instead.</p>
       <p>It was widely known that Ferguson felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team. The youngsters, who would be known as "Fergie's Fledglings", included <!--del_lnk--> Gary Neville, <!--del_lnk--> Phil Neville, <a href="../../wp/d/David_Beckham.htm" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Scholes and <!--del_lnk--> Nicky Butt, who would all go on to be important members of the team. And so the 1995&ndash;96 season began without a major signing, at a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and <a href="../../wp/n/Newcastle_United_F.C..htm" title="Newcastle United F.C.">Newcastle United</a> were making the headlines with big money signings.</p>
       <p>When United lost the first league match of the <!--del_lnk--> 1995&ndash;96 season 3&ndash;1 to Aston Villa, the media swooped upon Ferguson with undisguised glee. They wrote United off because Ferguson's squad contained so many young and inexperienced players. <a href="../../wp/m/Match_of_the_Day.htm" title="Match of the Day">Match of the Day</a> pundit, <!--del_lnk--> Alan Hansen proclaimed that "you can't win anything with kids".</p>
       <p>However, the young players performed well and United won their next five matches, exacting their revenge over Everton for the FA Cup defeat with a 3&ndash;2 win at <!--del_lnk--> Goodison Park and achieving a 2&ndash;1 away win over defending champions Blackburn Rovers who were now looking rather like relegation battlers than title contenders.</p>
       <p>Cantona's return from suspension was a boost, but they found themselves 10 points behind <a href="../../wp/n/Newcastle_United_F.C..htm" title="Newcastle United F.C.">Newcastle United</a> by Christmas 1995. A 2&ndash;0 home win over the <!--del_lnk--> Tynesiders on 27 December narrowed the gap to seven points and a subsequent win over struggling QPR narrowed it to four points, but a 4&ndash;1 defeat for United at Tottenham on New Year's Day 1996 and a 0&ndash;0 home draw with Aston Villa saw the Magpies re-establish their wide lead and it looked certain that the league title was Newcastle's.</p>
       <p>However a series of good results starting in mid January 1996 saw the gap close, and when United travelled to Newcastle and won 1&ndash;0 on 4 March, the gap was down to a single point.</p>
       <p>United went top of the league soon after the win at Newcastle, who continued to drop points in crucial games.</p>
       <p>Early April saw Newcastle manager <a href="../../wp/k/Kevin_Keegan.htm" title="Kevin Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a>'s famous outburst on live television ("I'd love it if we beat them! Love it!"), and is generally regarded as the moment that Ferguson gained the upper hand against his opponent, but their title hopes were hindered on 13 April when the Red Devils went to struggling <!--del_lnk--> Southampton for what should have been an easy win but instead they were 3&ndash;0 down at half-time, the players said the grey kit made it impossible to pick out players so they surprisingly changed to their blue and white third kit and pulled a goal back to lose 3&ndash;1. United's Premier League title success was confirmed on the final day of the season, when they defeated a <!--del_lnk--> Middlesbrough side managed by former United captain Bryan Robson in a game which ended in a 3&ndash;0 win despite strong displays by Boro confounding pre-match reports that Robson would give his old team an easy ride.</p>
       <p>They played Liverpool in that year's <!--del_lnk--> FA Cup final, winning 1&ndash;0 with a late goal by Cantona. This made them the first team in English football to repeat the double of the league title and FA Cup, and more impressive was the fact that it had been achieved with a similar set of players to the ones who achieved the first double.</p>
       <p>
        <br /><!--del_lnk--> 1996&ndash;97 saw Ferguson guide Manchester United to their fourth Premier League title in five seasons. In late autumn, they suffered three league defeats in a row and conceded 13 goals in the process. They also lost their 40 year unbeaten home record in Europe to unfancied Turkish side <!--del_lnk--> Fenerbah&ccedil;e. But they still reached the <a href="../../wp/u/UEFA_Champions_League.htm" title="UEFA Champions League">Champions League</a> semi final, where they lost to <!--del_lnk--> Borussia Dortmund of Germany. At the end of the season, Cantona surprisingly retired from football.</p>
       <p>Other success stories of the 1996&ndash;97 season were two <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> signings, striker <!--del_lnk--> Ole Gunnar Solskj&aelig;r (the club's top scorer that season) and defender <!--del_lnk--> Ronny Johnsen, who were bargain buys as they were little known outside the Premier League on their arrival the previous summer but went on to be key factors in United's fourth Premier League title.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1997.E2.80.9398">1997&ndash;98</span></h3>
       <p>In the close season, Manchester United appointed Keane as captain. Ferguson described him as "the best all-round player in the game" after the team's <!--del_lnk--> 1997 FA Charity Shield win and believed Keane had "all the right ingredients" to succeed from Cantona. United bolstered their squad in the summer; striker <!--del_lnk--> Teddy Sheringham and defender <!--del_lnk--> Henning Berg were the significant purchases, from Tottenham Hotspur and Blackburn Rovers respectively. Defeat to Leeds United in September 1997 was the team's first loss in seven months; Keane during the match injured himself and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season with ligament damage. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence. By November, United opened up a four-point lead in the league, which prompted a discussion of whether any team could catch them. After Arsenal's defeat of United in the same month, Ferguson acknowledged a one-horse race was "not good for the game" and admitted his opponents "...deserved to win on their second-half performance". The fallibilities of Liverpool, Chelsea and Blackburn Rovers as league challengers allowed United during the winter to extend their lead by 11 points, albeit with Arsenal having games-in-hand. This was enough for Manchester bookmaker <!--del_lnk--> Fred Done to pay out on punters who backed the champions retaining their title. United in other competitions faired poorly; they went out of the FA Cup in a replay to <!--del_lnk--> Barnsley and were eliminated in the quarter-final stage of the Champions League against <!--del_lnk--> AS Monaco on away goals. Arsenal closed the gap on United in March and a winning goal from their winger <!--del_lnk--> Marc Overmars when the two teams met at Old Trafford handed them the initiative. Ferguson was bullish of his team's chances despite the setback and insisted that Arsenal "...will find that they start dropping points towards the end of the season &ndash; there's no question about that". Arsenal however collected maximum points, sealing the title with a win against Everton on 3 May 1998. Ferguson congratulated his opponent <!--del_lnk--> Ars&egrave;ne Wenger, who in his first full season at the club, later completed the double: "I think it's good for my young players to lose on this occasion. I wholeheartedly acknowledge what Arsenal achieved between Christmas and the end of the season." United straight after paid &pound;10.75 million for PSV defender <!--del_lnk--> Jaap Stam, a new club record fee. Ferguson wanted to strengthen the squad's attacking options and identified Aston Villa's <!--del_lnk--> Dwight Yorke as his main target. Attempts to sign the player were rebuffed at first, before Ferguson persuaded Edwards to increase United's initial offer of &pound;10 million. A &pound;12.6 million deal was reached a week into the league campaign; Yorke signed minutes before the deadline to submit United's squad for the Champions League.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1998.E2.80.9399:_Treble_success">1998&ndash;99: Treble success</span></h3>
       <p>The 1998&ndash;99 season saw United complete an unprecedented <!--del_lnk--> treble of trophies: the league, FA Cup and Champions League. The success coincided with the club becoming the world's richest and most valuable sporting brand worldwide. United were at the centre of a takeover bid from <!--del_lnk--> BSkyB in September 1998, which prompted an angry reaction from supporters. Ferguson refused to be drawn over the controversy of the deal; he nevertheless praised the company for their work in football. The government later referred the deal to the Mergers Commission, which was blocked in April 1999. On the pitch, United made a steady start in all competitions and lost for the final time in the season against Middlesbrough in December 1998, where Ferguson was absent on bereavement leave. Their route to the <!--del_lnk--> 1999 FA Cup Final, which they won 2&ndash;0 against Newcastle United, mostly involved ties against fellow league clubs. In the semi-final replay against cup holders Arsenal, Keane was sent off and United conceded a penalty late into the match; it was <!--del_lnk--> Dennis Bergkamp's effort was saved by Schmeichel. Giggs in extra time ran the length of the pitch and scored what <i>The Times</i> reporter Oliver Holt described as "a goal of breathtaking skill". In the league, United regained the title after a closely fought challenge from Arsenal.</p>
       <p>After finishing second in their Champions League group &ndash; behind Bayern Munich and ahead of Barcelona &ndash; and knocking-out <!--del_lnk--> Inter Milan in the quarter-final stage, United faced Juventus in the last four. An injury time goal scored by Giggs in the first leg earned the team a 1&ndash;1 draw, but in spite of conceding an away goal, Ferguson was adamant of United's chances of reaching the final: "...something tells me we are going to win. The nature of our club is that we torture ourselves so much that the only way to get relief is by winning over there. It will be a great game and hopefully I am right." At the <!--del_lnk--> Stadio delle Alpi, striker <!--del_lnk--> Filippo Inzaghi scored twice to put Juventus 3&ndash;1 up on aggregate. Keane headed in a Beckham cross to halve the deficit, but was later shown a yellow card for a foul on <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Davids, which prevented him from playing in the final. Yorke equalised, before Cole added a third to win the match outright. Ferguson described his captain's performance as "the most emphatic display of selflessness ... he inspired all around him. I felt it was an honour to be associated with such a player". In Barcelona, where the <!--del_lnk--> 1999 UEFA Champions League Final was staged against Bayern Munich, United conceded inside six minutes, through <!--del_lnk--> Mario Basler's free kick. Sheringham equalised from a corner late into the match and Solskj&aelig;r in added time scored the winner, from another set piece. When interviewed moments after the match, Ferguson said:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Football, bloody hell.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Ferguson and Schmeichel, the stand-in captain, jointly lifted the cup during the trophy presentation. A crowd of over 500,000 people turned out on the streets of Manchester to greet the players, who paraded through the city in an open-top bus. As European champions, United were invited to play in the <!--del_lnk--> Intercontinental Cup. The club also entered the inaugural <!--del_lnk--> Club World Championship, which was held in Brazil. Given the possibility of a hectic fixture schedule, United withdrew from the FA Cup, becoming the first holders to do so. In later years, Ferguson cited the decision was done to server England's failed <!--del_lnk--> 2006 FIFA World Cup bid, to which he moreover expressed regrets in how the club dealt with the situation.</p>
       <p>On 12 June 1999, Ferguson received a knighthood in recognition of his services to the game. On 11 October 1999, a special testimonial match was played in honour of Ferguson's contribution to the team. <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester_United_F.C..htm" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> played against a team dubbed "Rest of the World XI", managed by <!--del_lnk--> Ottmar Hitzfeld, with his team consisting of names such as <!--del_lnk--> Henrik Larsson, <!--del_lnk--> Gianluca Vialli, <!--del_lnk--> Cafu, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Gascoigne, <!--del_lnk--> George Weah, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Schmeichel and <!--del_lnk--> Eric Cantona, but with 20 minutes to go there was a mass substitution of their players, who were replaced by a former Manchester United XI; Peter Schmeichel, Paul Parker, <!--del_lnk--> Clayton Blackmore, <!--del_lnk--> Steve Bruce, <!--del_lnk--> Gary Pallister, <!--del_lnk--> Darren Ferguson, Mark Hughes, <!--del_lnk--> Lee Sharpe, and three number sevens: Bryan Robson, <a href="../../wp/d/David_Beckham.htm" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Eric Cantona. The World XI won the game 4&ndash;2.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Title_hat-trick">Title hat-trick</span></h3>
       <p>Manchester United ended the 1999&ndash;2000 season as champions with just three Premier League defeats, and a cushion of 18 points. The massive gap between United and the rest of the Premier League, although they had faced stiff competition from the likes of Arsenal and Leeds United until the final weeks of the season, caused some to wonder if the club's financial dominance was developing into a problem for the English game.</p>
       <p>In April 2000, it was announced that Manchester United had agreed to sign Dutch striker <!--del_lnk--> Ruud van Nistelrooy from <!--del_lnk--> PSV Eindhoven for a British record fee of &pound;18million. But the move was put on hold when van Nistelrooy failed a medical, and he then returned to his homeland in a bid to regain fitness, only to suffer a serious knee injury which ruled him out for almost a year.</p>
       <p>28-year-old French goalkeeper <!--del_lnk--> Fabien Barthez was signed from <!--del_lnk--> Monaco for &pound;7.8million&mdash;making him the most expensive goalkeeper to be signed by a British club , and United won the title again, becoming only the fourth side in history to win the English league title three seasons in succession. They also matched Liverpool's record (set in 1991) of 10 successive top two finishes.</p>
       <p>However, the press largely saw the 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01 campaigns as failures as United had failed to win the European Cup, falling at the quarter final stages to <!--del_lnk--> Real Madrid in 2000 and Bayern Munich in 2001.</p>
       <p>During the 2001 close season <!--del_lnk--> Ruud van Nistelrooy joined, and soon after Manchester United again broke the British transfer record&mdash;this time paying <!--del_lnk--> Lazio &pound;28.1million for Argentine attacking midfielder <!--del_lnk--> Juan Sebasti&aacute;n Ver&oacute;n, although he failed to live up to the high expectations his transfer fee suggested and he was sold to Chelsea for &pound;15million only two years later.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rebuilding_and_transition">Rebuilding and transition</span></h3>
       <p>Two games into the 2001&ndash;02 season, Dutch central defender <!--del_lnk--> Jaap Stam was sold to <!--del_lnk--> Lazio in a &pound;16million deal. The reason for Stam's departure was believed to have been claims in his autobiography <i>Head to Head</i> that he had been illegally spoken to about a move to Manchester United by Ferguson, before his previous club <!--del_lnk--> PSV Eindhoven had been informed. Ferguson replaced Stam with <!--del_lnk--> Internazionale's 36-year-old central defender <!--del_lnk--> Laurent Blanc.</p>
       <p>Before the season began, Ferguson also lost his assistant Steve McClaren, who took over as manager of <!--del_lnk--> Middlesbrough, and gave the role to long-serving coach <!--del_lnk--> Jimmy Ryan until a more permanent successor could be found.</p>
       <p>By 8 December 2001, after a terrible run of form which saw one win and five defeats on a period of seven league games, Manchester United were ninth in the Premier League&nbsp;&mdash; 11 points behind leaders Liverpool who had a game in hand. Then came a dramatic turn around in form: between mid-December and late January, as eight successive wins saw Manchester United climb to the top of the Premier League and put their title challenge back on track. Despite this, United finished third in the League as rival Ars&egrave;ne Wenger clinched the title for Arsenal at Old Trafford with a 1&ndash;0 win in the penultimate game of the season after United dropped points in a couple of other crucial games during the run-in.</p>
       <p>United were also unsuccessful in Europe, losing the Champions League semi-final on away goals to <!--del_lnk--> Bayer Leverkusen. Early exits from the League Cup and FA Cup meant that the season ended trophyless. As they were third in the league and had not reached a cup final, it was the first time since 1989 that they had finished a season without being winners or runners-up of a major competition.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 2001&ndash;02 season was to have been Ferguson's last as Manchester United manager, and the looming date of his retirement was cited in the press as a reason for the team's loss of form. Ferguson himself admitted that the decision to pre-announce his retirement had resulted in a negative effect on the players and on his ability to impose discipline. But in February 2002 he agreed to stay in charge for at least another three years.</p>
       <p>The close season saw Manchester United break the British transfer record yet again when they paid <!--del_lnk--> Leeds United &pound;30million for 24-year-old central defender <!--del_lnk--> Rio Ferdinand.</p>
       <p>That summer, Ferguson brought in <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> coach <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Queiroz as his assistant.</p>
       <p>Manchester United won their eighth Premier League title yet just over two months before the end of the season they were eight points behind leaders Arsenal. But an improvement in form for United, and a decline for Arsenal, saw the Premier League trophy gradually slip out of the Londoners' grasp and push it back in the direction of Old Trafford. Ferguson described the 2002&ndash;03 title triumph as his most satisfying ever, due to the nature of a remarkable comeback. The excellent run-in had produced 10 wins and a draw (including 4&ndash;0 home win over Liverpool and a 6&ndash;2 away demolition of Newcastle United) from the final 11 games, and no defeats since Boxing Day. Much was made in the press of Ferguson's successful 'mind games' with Wenger in winning the title.</p>
       <p>Ferguson guided Manchester United to their eleventh FA Cup at the end of the 2003&ndash;04 season, but it was a disappointing season which had seen them finish third in the Premier League (which was won by an undefeated Arsenal side) and suffer Champions League elimination at the hands of eventual winners <!--del_lnk--> FC Porto. Rio Ferdinand missed the final four months of the season, as he served the beginning of an eight-month ban for missing a drugs test. New signings like <!--del_lnk--> Eric Djemba-Djemba and <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Kl&eacute;berson were disappointing, United tried to sign Ronaldinho and Fergie believed the deal was as good as done before Peter Kenyon caused it to fall apart, but there was at least one productive signing in teenage Portuguese winger <a href="../../wp/c/Cristiano_Ronaldo.htm" title="Cristiano Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. Striker <!--del_lnk--> Louis Saha, added in January, also proved to be reasonably successful covering for the injured Ole Gunnar Solskj&aelig;r in attack.</p>
       <p>At the beginning of the 2004&ndash;05 season, teenage striker <a href="../../wp/w/Wayne_Rooney.htm" title="Wayne Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> (the world's most expensive teenager at more than &pound;20million) and Argentine defender <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Heinze joined United while Cristiano Ronaldo continued where he had left off the previous season by putting in more match-winning performances. But the lack of a striker after van Nistelrooy spent most of the season injured saw the club finish third for the third time in four seasons. In the <a href="../../wp/f/FA_Cup.htm" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> they lost on <!--del_lnk--> penalties to Arsenal. A second round exit from the European Cup at the hands of <!--del_lnk--> AC Milan and a semi-final exit from the League Cup at the hands of eventual winners Chelsea (who also clinched the Premier League title) meant that 2004&ndash;05 was a rare instance of a trophyless season for United.</p>
       <p>Ferguson's preparations for the season were disrupted by a high-profile dispute with major shareholder <!--del_lnk--> John Magnier, over the ownership of the racehorse <!--del_lnk--> Rock of Gibraltar. When Magnier and business partner <!--del_lnk--> J. P. McManus agreed to sell their shares to American business tycoon <!--del_lnk--> Malcolm Glazer, it cleared the way for Glazer to acquire full control of the club. This sparked violent protests from United fans , and disrupted Ferguson's plans to strengthen the team in the transfer market. In spite of this, United looked to solve their goalkeeping and midfield problems. For this, they signed the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch keeper <!--del_lnk--> Edwin van der Sar from <!--del_lnk--> Fulham and <!--del_lnk--> Korean star <!--del_lnk--> Park Ji-Sung from <!--del_lnk--> PSV.</p>
       <p>The season was one of transition. On 18 November, <!--del_lnk--> Roy Keane officially left the club, his contract ended by mutual consent. United failed to qualify for the knock-out phase of the UEFA Champions' League. In the January transfer window <a href="../../wp/s/Serbia.htm" title="Serbia">Serbian</a> defender <!--del_lnk--> Nemanja Vidi&#x107; and French full-back <!--del_lnk--> Patrice Evra were signed, and the side finished in second place in the league, behind runaway leaders Chelsea. Winning the League Cup was a consolation prize for lack of success elsewhere. <!--del_lnk--> Ruud van Nistelrooy's future at Old Trafford seemed to be in doubt after not starting in the League Cup final, and he departed at the end of the season.</p>

       <p>In 2006, <!--del_lnk--> Michael Carrick was signed as a replacement for Roy Keane for &pound;14&nbsp;million, although the figure may eventually rise in the future to &pound;18.6&nbsp;million depending on appearances and results. United started the season well, and for the first time ever won their first four <a href="../../wp/p/Premier_League.htm" title="Premier League">Premier League</a> games. They set the early pace in the Premier League and never relinquished top spot from the tenth match of the 38&ndash;game season. The January 2006 signings had a huge impact on United's performances; <!--del_lnk--> Patrice Evra and <!--del_lnk--> Nemanja Vidi&#x107; came in to form a solid back line along with already existing players <!--del_lnk--> Rio Ferdinand and skipper <!--del_lnk--> Gary Neville. The signing of <!--del_lnk--> Michael Carrick, which was questioned and criticised by a large portion of the media, brought stability and further creativity in the United midfield, forming an effective partnership with Paul Scholes. <!--del_lnk--> Park Ji-Sung and <a href="../../wp/r/Ryan_Giggs.htm" title="Ryan Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> both underlined their value to the first team squad by adding significant pace and incisiveness in attack with <a href="../../wp/w/Wayne_Rooney.htm" title="Wayne Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
       <p>Ferguson celebrated the 20th anniversary of his appointment as manager of Manchester United on 6 November 2006. Tributes also came from Ferguson's players, both past and present, as well as his old foe, <!--del_lnk--> Ars&egrave;ne Wenger, his old captain, <!--del_lnk--> Roy Keane, and current players. The party was spoiled the following day when United endured a single-goal defeat at the hands of <!--del_lnk--> Southend in the fourth round of the <!--del_lnk--> League Cup. However, on 1 December it was announced that Manchester United had signed 35 year old <!--del_lnk--> Henrik Larsson on loan, a player that Ferguson had admired for many years, and attempted to capture previously. On 23 December 2006, Cristiano Ronaldo scored the club's 2000th goal under the helm of Ferguson in a match against Aston Villa.</p>
       <p>Manchester United subsequently won their ninth Premier League title but were denied a unique fourth double by Chelsea's Didier Drogba scoring a late goal in the FA Cup Final at <a href="../../wp/w/Wembley_Stadium.htm" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley</a>.</p>
       <p>In the Champions League, the club reached the semi-finals, recording a 7&ndash;1 home win over <!--del_lnk--> Roma in the quarter-final second leg, but lost at the <!--del_lnk--> San Siro to Milan 3&ndash;0 in the second leg of the semi-final after being 3&ndash;2 up from the first leg. Still, it was a strong sign that United were on their way back to dominance after a couple of years of being overshadowed by Arsenal and more particularly Chelsea.</p>
       <p>For the 2007&ndash;08 season, Ferguson made notable signings to reinforce United's first team. Long-term target <!--del_lnk--> Owen Hargreaves joined from <!--del_lnk--> Bayern Munich, bringing an end to a year of negotiations. Ferguson further bolstered the midfield with the additions of young Portuguese winger <!--del_lnk--> Nani and Brazilian playmaker <!--del_lnk--> Anderson. The last summer signing was of <!--del_lnk--> West Ham United and <!--del_lnk--> Argentina striker <!--del_lnk--> Carlos T&eacute;vez after a complex and protracted transfer saga.</p>
       <p>United had their worst start to a season under Ferguson, drawing their first two league games before suffering a 1&ndash;0 defeat to local rivals Manchester City. However, United recovered and began a tight race with Arsenal for the title. After a good run of form, Ferguson claimed that throughout his time at Manchester United, this was the best squad he had managed to assemble thus far.</p>
       <p>On 16 February 2008, United beat Arsenal 4&ndash;0 in an <a href="../../wp/f/FA_Cup.htm" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> Fifth Round match at <!--del_lnk--> Old Trafford, but were knocked out by eventual winners <!--del_lnk--> Portsmouth (a mid table side in the league) in the quarter final on 8 March, losing 1&ndash;0 at home. United having had a penalty claim turned down, Ferguson alleged after the game that <!--del_lnk--> Keith Hackett, general manager of the <!--del_lnk--> Professional Game Match Officials Board, was "not doing his job properly". Ferguson was subsequently charged by the FA with improper conduct, which he decided to contest. This was the second charge Ferguson faced in the season, following his complaints against the referee after United lost 1&ndash;0 at <!--del_lnk--> Bolton Wanderers&nbsp;&ndash; a charge he decided not to contest.</p>
       <p>On 11 May 2008, Ferguson led Manchester United to a tenth Premier League title, exactly 25 years to the day after he led Aberdeen to European glory against Real Madrid in the European Cup Winners' Cup. Nearest rivals Chelsea&nbsp;&ndash; level on points going into the final round of matches, but with an inferior goal difference&nbsp;&ndash; could only draw 1&ndash;1 at home to Bolton, finishing two points adrift of the champions. United's title win was sealed with a 2&ndash;0 win over Wigan Athletic, managed by former United captain <!--del_lnk--> Steve Bruce, who before the game blew the whistle on suggestions that he would give his old club an easy ride &ndash; just as Bryan Robson had done 12 years earlier.</p>

       <p>On 21 May 2008, Ferguson won his second European Cup with Manchester United as they beat Chelsea 6&ndash;5 on penalties in the <!--del_lnk--> Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, following a 1&ndash;1 draw after extra time in the first ever all-English UEFA Champions League Final. A penalty miss from Cristiano Ronaldo meant that <!--del_lnk--> John Terry's spot-kick would have given the trophy to Chelsea if successfully converted, but Terry blew his chance of glory and in the end it was <!--del_lnk--> Edwin van der Sar's blocking of a <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas Anelka penalty which gave the trophy to Manchester United for the second time under Ferguson and for the third time overall.</p>
       <p>After winning the <!--del_lnk--> 2007&ndash;08 UEFA Champions League Ferguson had stated that his intention to leave Manchester United within the next three years, meaning that he would be gone by the summer of 2011. Manchester United Chief Executive <!--del_lnk--> David Gill moved quickly to calm the speculation about Ferguson's pending retirement.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Another_two_league_titles_and_League_Cups">Another two league titles and League Cups</span></h3>
       <p>Although the team had a slow start to the 2008&ndash;09 season, United won the Premier League with a game to spare, making Ferguson the first manager in the history of English football to win the Premier League three times consecutively, on two separate occasions. Ferguson had now won 11 league titles at Manchester United, and the 2008&ndash;09 season title success put them level with Liverpool as league champions on a record 18 occasions in total. They also won the <!--del_lnk--> Football League Cup on penalties after a goalless Wembley draw with Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
       <p>They contested the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 Champions League final against <!--del_lnk--> FC Barcelona on 27 May 2009 but lost 2&ndash;0.</p>
       <p>After the presentation ceremony, Ferguson conceded that he would stay on at United for as long as his health permitted him and that he would be glad to win the league title once more. This would make United's total league wins one more than rivals Liverpool, becoming the outright leader in total wins.</p>
       <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2009&ndash;10, Ferguson added another <!--del_lnk--> Football League Cup to his honours list as United defeated Aston Villa 2&ndash;1 in the Wembley final on 28 February 2010. However, his dreams of a third European Cup were ended a few weeks later when United were edged out of the competition in the quarter-finals by Bayern Munich on away goals. And their hopes of a record 19th league title were ended on the last day of the season when Chelsea beat them to the Premier League title, crushing Wigan Athletic 8&ndash;0 and rendering United's 4&ndash;0 win over <!--del_lnk--> Stoke City meaningless. Around this time, several newspapers carried reports that Ferguson was due to retire at the end of the <!--del_lnk--> 2010&ndash;11 season, but he denied these rumours and insisted that he wants to go out on a high and will not retire during a time of struggle.</p>
       <p>On 8 August 2010, Ferguson added another <!--del_lnk--> FA Community Shield to his honours list as United defeated Chelsea 3&ndash;1 in the final in Wembley. On 19 December 2010, Ferguson became Manchester United's longest serving manager in history, overtaking <!--del_lnk--> Matt Busby's record of 24 years, 1 month and 13 days in charge of the club. He ended the season by winning his 12th and Manchester United's 19th league title and thus overtaking Liverpool's record of 18. Manchester United faced Barcelona again on 28 May 2011 in the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 UEFA Champions League Final, their third in four years, but United lost 3&ndash;1. Analyst <!--del_lnk--> Alan Hansen stated that he believed Ferguson was "the key component" in United's success that season, so key in fact that "[he] would have claimed the crown with any of the other top sides had he been in charge of them". With <!--del_lnk--> Edwin van der Sar, <!--del_lnk--> Gary Neville and Paul Scholes all retiring in 2011, Ferguson spent big by signing defender <!--del_lnk--> Phil Jones from <!--del_lnk--> Blackburn Rovers and winger <!--del_lnk--> Ashley Young from Aston Villa for around &pound;17&nbsp;million each, and goalkeeper <!--del_lnk--> David de Gea from <!--del_lnk--> Atl&eacute;tico Madrid for around &pound;19&nbsp;million.</p>
       <p>On 2 September 2012, Ferguson managed his 1000th league game with United against <!--del_lnk--> Southampton. Two weeks later, he won his 100th game in the Champions League with a 1&ndash;0 win over <!--del_lnk--> Galatasaray at Old Trafford.</p>
       <p>On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. <i>The Guardian</i> announced it was the "end of an era", while UEFA president <!--del_lnk--> Michel Platini said that Ferguson was "a true visionary". British Prime Minister <a href="../../wp/d/David_Cameron.htm" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a> described Ferguson as a "remarkable man in British football". Former Manchester United players <!--del_lnk--> Paul Ince and <!--del_lnk--> Bryan Robson agreed that Ferguson would be "a hard act to follow". Manchester United co-chairman <!--del_lnk--> Joel Glazer said "His determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable."</p>

On 5 April 2003, Ferguson claimed that the <a href="../../wp/u/UEFA_Champions_League.htm" title="UEFA Champions League">Champions League</a> draw was fixed in favour of Spanish and Italian teams, resulting in a fine on 1 May of 10,000 Swiss francs (&pound;4,600).</p>

Magnier counter-sued Ferguson by filing a "Motion to Comply" requiring Ferguson to substantiate his claim for half of Rock of Gibraltar's stud fees. The legal issues were further compounded by the request for "99 Questions" to be answered over Ferguson's transfer dealings, including those of Jaap Stam, Juan Ver&oacute;n, Tim Howard, David Bellion, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kl&eacute;berson. The case was eventually settled out of Court.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_BBC">The BBC</span></h3>
       <p>Ferguson refused to give interviews to the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> after a documentary called <i>Father and Son</i> was shown on UK television in 2004. According to an article in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Independent</i> newspaper, the documentary had "portrayed his agent son, Jason, as somebody who exploited his father's influence and position to his own ends in the transfer market." The same newspaper article made it clear that "Ferguson Jnr" was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Ferguson Senior as follows: "They [the BBC] did a story about my son that was whole lot of nonsense. It all [<i><!--del_lnk--> sic</i>] made-up stuff and 'brown paper bags' and all that kind of carry-on. It was a horrible attack on my son's honour and he should never have been accused of that." Subsequent interviews on BBC programmes such as <i><a href="../../wp/m/Match_of_the_Day.htm" title="Match of the Day">Match of the Day</a></i> were done by his assistant <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Queiroz, and later <!--del_lnk--> Mike Phelan.</p>
       <p>Under new Premiership rules intended for the 2010&ndash;11 season, Ferguson was required to end his BBC boycott. However he refused to end his boycott and Manchester United confirmed the club would pay the resulting fines.

        <li>20 October 2003 &ndash; Two match touchline ban and fined &pound;10,000 after using abusive and/or insulting words towards fourth official <!--del_lnk--> Jeff Winter.</li>
        <li>14 December 2007 &ndash; Two match touchline ban and fined &pound;5,000 after using abusive and/or insulting words towards <!--del_lnk--> Mark Clattenburg.</li>
        <li>18 November 2008 &ndash; Two match touchline ban and fined &pound;10,000 after confronting <!--del_lnk--> Mike Dean after a game.</li>
        <li>12 November 2009 &ndash; Four match touchline ban (two suspended) and fined &pound;20,000 for comments made about the fitness of <!--del_lnk--> Alan Wiley.</li>
        <li>16 March 2011 &ndash; Five match touchline ban (three plus the two suspended for the above offence) and fined &pound;30,000 for comments made questioning the performance and fairness of <!--del_lnk--> Martin Atkinson.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>It has also been suggested that Ferguson's intimidation of referees results in "Fergie Time": that is, unusually generous <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Association_football.htm" title="Injury time">injury time</a> being added in matches where Manchester United are behind. The phrase is at least as old as 2004, and a statistical analysis by <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times</i> suggests that this comment might be valid, though the article points out that other footballing criteria may explain the correlation between extra added time and United being behind. Analysis by <!--del_lnk--> Opta Sports of Premier League matches played between 2010 and 2012 found on average that 79 seconds more time was played in matches where Manchester United were losing. This was a greater figure than for other top clubs, although most of these clubs seem to benefit from a "Fergie Time" effect, particularly in their home matches.</p>

       <p>One recurring theme of Ferguson's management of Manchester United has been his view that no player is bigger than the club. He has consistently taken a "my way or the highway" approach in his dealings with players and the pressure of this management tactic has often been the cause of many notable players' departures. Over the years players such as <!--del_lnk--> Gordon Strachan, <!--del_lnk--> Paul McGrath, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Ince, <!--del_lnk--> Jaap Stam, <!--del_lnk--> Dwight Yorke, <a href="../../wp/d/David_Beckham.htm" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ruud van Nistelrooy and <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Heinze have left the club after varying degrees of conflict with Ferguson. It is also suggested that one of the most inspirational players in the club's history, <!--del_lnk--> Roy Keane, was a victim of Ferguson's wrath following damning criticism of his teammates on the club's in-house television channel, <!--del_lnk--> MUTV. This disciplinary line that he takes with such highly paid, high-profile players has been cited as a reason for the ongoing success of Manchester United.</p>
       <p>Many of Ferguson's former players have gone on to become football managers themselves, including <!--del_lnk--> Bryan Robson, <!--del_lnk--> Steve Bruce, <!--del_lnk--> Mark Hughes, <!--del_lnk--> Roy Keane, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Ince, <!--del_lnk--> Chris Casper, <!--del_lnk--> Darren Ferguson, <!--del_lnk--> Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and <!--del_lnk--> Henning Berg.</p>
       <p>The phrase "squeaky-bum time" coined by Ferguson in reference to the tense final stages of a league competition has been included in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Collins English Dictionary</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Oxford English Dictionary</i>.</p>
       <p>A bronze statue designed by Scottish sculptor <!--del_lnk--> Philip Jackson, and named after Ferguson was unveiled outside <!--del_lnk--> Old Trafford on 23 November 2012.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
       <p>Ferguson lives in <!--del_lnk--> Wilmslow, Cheshire, with his wife, Cathy Ferguson, Lady Ferguson (n&eacute;e Holding). They married in 1966 and have three sons: Mark (born 1968), and twins <!--del_lnk--> Darren (born 1972), current manager of <!--del_lnk--> Peterborough United and former manager of <!--del_lnk--> Preston North End, and Jason, who runs an events management company.</p>
       <p>In 1998, Ferguson was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the <a href="../../wp/l/Labour_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>. He is also a lifelong Labour voter and in January 2011 <!--del_lnk--> Graham Stringer, a Labour MP in <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> and Manchester United supporter, called for Ferguson to be made a <!--del_lnk--> life peer. If this happened, it would make Ferguson the first current or former footballer or football manager to sit in the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>.</p>
       <p>In 2009 Ferguson received a Honorary Doctorate in Business Administration from the <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Metropolitan University.  It was a second degree received from the university, after receiving a honorary masters in 1998.</p>

       <p>Ferguson was made an Inaugural Inductee of the <!--del_lnk--> English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a manager. In 2003, Ferguson became an inaugural recipient of the FA Coaching Diploma, awarded to all coaches who had at least ten years' experience of being a manager or head coach.</p>
       <p>He is the Vice-President of the <!--del_lnk--> National Football Museum, based in <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, and a member of the Executive Committee of the <!--del_lnk--> League Managers Association.</p>
       <p>In addition to being the only manager to win the top league honours, and the 'Double', north and south of the England&ndash;Scotland border (winning the Premier League with Manchester United, and the Scottish Premier Division with Aberdeen), he is also the last manager to win the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish championship with a non <!--del_lnk--> Old Firm team, achieving this in the <!--del_lnk--> 1984&ndash;85 season with <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen. He is also the only manager in <!--del_lnk--> English football to have managed to finish in the top three league places in 20 consecutive seasons, since the <!--del_lnk--> 1991&ndash;92 season.</p>
       <p>On 5 November 2011, the <!--del_lnk--> Old Trafford North Stand was officially renamed the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand in honour of his 25 years as manager of <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester_United_F.C..htm" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a>.</p>
       <p>He has won 49 trophies as a manager, making him the most successful British football manager in history.</p>
