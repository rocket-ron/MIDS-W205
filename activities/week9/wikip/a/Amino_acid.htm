       <p><b>Amino acids</b> are <a href="../../wp/m/Molecule.htm" title="Molecule">molecules</a> containing an <a href="../../wp/a/Amine.htm" title="Amine">amine</a> group, a <a href="../../wp/c/Carboxylic_acid.htm" title="Carboxylic acid">carboxylic acid</a> group and a side chain that varies between different amino acids. The key elements of an amino acid are <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, and <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. They are particularly important in biochemistry, where the term usually refers to <i>alpha-amino acids</i>.</p>
       <p>An alpha-amino acid has the generic <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_formula.htm" title="Chemical formula">formula</a> H<sub>2</sub>NCHRCOOH, where R is an organic <!--del_lnk--> substituent; the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (the <!--del_lnk--> &alpha;&ndash;carbon). Other types of amino acid exist when the amino group is attached to a different carbon atom; for example, in gamma-amino acids (such as <!--del_lnk--> gamma-amino-butyric acid) the carbon atom to which the amino group attaches is separated from the carboxylate group by two other carbon atoms. The various alpha-amino acids differ in which <!--del_lnk--> side chain (R-group) is attached to their alpha carbon, and can vary in size from just one <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> atom in <!--del_lnk--> glycine to a large <!--del_lnk--> heterocyclic group in <!--del_lnk--> tryptophan.</p>
       <p>Amino acids are critical to life, and have many functions in <!--del_lnk--> metabolism. One particularly important function is to serve as the building blocks of <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">proteins</a>, which are simply linear chains of amino acids. Just as the letters of the alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked together in varying sequences to form a vast variety of proteins.</p>
       <p>Due to their central role in biochemistry, amino acids are important in <a href="../../wp/n/Nutrition.htm" title="Nutrition">nutrition</a> and are commonly used in <!--del_lnk--> food technology and <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industry</a>. For example, <!--del_lnk--> monosodium glutamate is a common <!--del_lnk--> flavor enhancer that gives food the taste <i><!--del_lnk--> umami</i>. In industry, applications include the production of <!--del_lnk--> biodegradable plastics, <!--del_lnk--> drugs, and <!--del_lnk--> chiral catalysts.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>The first few amino acids were discovered in the early 19th century. In 1806, the French chemists <!--del_lnk--> Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Jean Robiquet isolated a compound in <a href="../../wp/a/Asparagus.htm" title="Asparagus">asparagus</a> that proved to be <!--del_lnk--> asparagine, the first amino acid to be discovered. Another amino acid that was discovered in the early 19th century was <!--del_lnk--> cystine, in 1810, although its monomer, <!--del_lnk--> cysteine, was discovered much later, in 1884. <!--del_lnk--> Glycine and <!--del_lnk--> leucine were also discovered around this time, in 1820. Usage of the term <i>amino acid</i> in the English language is from <a href="../../wp/1/1898.htm" title="1898">1898</a>.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>In the structure shown at the top of the page, <b>R</b> represents a <!--del_lnk--> side chain specific to each amino acid. The <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> atom next to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Carboxylic_acid.htm" title="Carboxyl group">carboxyl group</a> is called the <!--del_lnk--> &alpha;&ndash;carbon and amino acids with a side chain bonded to this carbon are referred to as <i>alpha amino acids</i>. These are the most common form found in nature. In the alpha amino acids, the &alpha;&ndash;carbon is a <!--del_lnk--> chiral carbon atom, with the exception of <!--del_lnk--> glycine. In amino acids that have a carbon chain attached to the &alpha;&ndash;carbon (such as <!--del_lnk--> lysine, shown to the right) the carbons are labeled in order as &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, &delta;, and so on. In some amino acids, the amine group is attached to the &beta; or &gamma;-carbon, and these are therefore referred to as <i>beta</i> or <i>gamma amino acids</i>.</p>
       <p>Amino acids are usually classified by the <!--del_lnk--> properties of their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a <!--del_lnk--> weak acid or a <!--del_lnk--> weak <!--del_lnk--> base, and a <!--del_lnk--> hydrophile if the side chain is <!--del_lnk--> polar or a <!--del_lnk--> hydrophobe if it is <!--del_lnk--> nonpolar. The <!--del_lnk--> chemical structures of the twenty-two standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these <!--del_lnk--> proteinogenic amino acids.</p>
       <p>The phrase "<!--del_lnk--> branched-chain amino acids" or BCAA refers to the amino acids having <!--del_lnk--> aliphatic side chains that are non-linear; these are <!--del_lnk--> leucine, <!--del_lnk--> isoleucine, and <!--del_lnk--> valine. <!--del_lnk--> Proline is the only <!--del_lnk--> proteinogenic amino acid whose side group links to the &alpha;-amino group and, thus, is also the only proteinogenic amino acid containing a secondary amine at this position. Chemically, proline is therefore an <!--del_lnk--> imino acid since it lacks a <a href="../../wp/a/Amine.htm" title="Amine">primary amino group</a>, although it is still classed as an amino acid in the current biochemical nomenclature, and may also be called an "N-alkylated alpha-amino acid".</p>

       <p>Of the standard &alpha;-amino acids, all but <!--del_lnk--> glycine can exist in either of two <!--del_lnk--> optical isomers, called <small>L</small> or <small>D</small> amino acids, which are mirror images of each other (<i>see also <!--del_lnk--> Chirality</i>). While <small>L</small>-amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">proteins</a> during translation in the ribosome, <small>D</small>-amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme <!--del_lnk--> posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as <!--del_lnk--> cone snails. They are also abundant components of the <!--del_lnk--> peptidoglycan <!--del_lnk--> cell walls of <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>, and <small>D</small>-serine may act as a <!--del_lnk--> neurotransmitter in the <a href="../../wp/b/Brain.htm" title="Brain">brain</a>. The <small>L</small> and <small>D</small> convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself, but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of <!--del_lnk--> glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can theoretically be synthesized (<small>D</small>-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotary; <small>L</small>-glyceraldehyde is levorotary). Alternatively, the <!--del_lnk--> <i>(S)</i> and <i>(R)</i> designators are used to indicate the absolute <!--del_lnk--> stereochemistry. Almost all of the <!--del_lnk--> amino acids in proteins are <i>(S)</i> at the &alpha; carbon, with cysteine being <i>(R)</i> and glycine non-chiral. Cysteine is unusual since it has a <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> atom at the second position in its side-chain, which has a larger <!--del_lnk--> atomic mass than the groups attached to the first carbon which is attached to the &alpha;-carbon in the other standard amino acids, thus the <i>(R)</i> instead of <i>(S)</i>.</p>

       <p>The amine and carboxylic acid functional groups found in amino acids allow it to have <!--del_lnk--> amphiprotic properties.

The amino acids all have different isoelectric points. The ions produced at the isoelectric point have both positive and negative charges and are known as a <i><!--del_lnk--> zwitterion,</i> which comes from the German word <i>Zwitter</i> meaning "hermaphrodite" or "hybrid". Amino acids can exist as zwitterions in solids and in polar solutions such as water, but not in the gas phase. Zwitterions have minimal <a href="../../wp/s/Solubility.htm" title="Solubility">solubility</a> at their isolectric point and an amino acid can be isolated by <!--del_lnk--> precipitating it from water by adjusting the pH to its particular isoelectric point.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Standard_amino_acids">Standard amino acids</span></h3>
       <p>Amino acids are the structural units that make up proteins. They join together to form short <!--del_lnk--> polymer chains called <!--del_lnk--> peptides or longer chains called either <!--del_lnk--> polypeptides or <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">proteins</a>. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins is called <i><!--del_lnk--> translation</i> and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a <!--del_lnk--> ribozyme that is called a <!--del_lnk--> ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the <a href="../../wp/g/Genetic_code.htm" title="Genetic code">genetic code</a> from an <!--del_lnk--> mRNA template, which is a <!--del_lnk--> RNA copy of one of the organism's <!--del_lnk--> genes.</p>
       <p>Twenty-two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called <!--del_lnk--> proteinogenic or standard amino acids. Of these twenty-two, twenty are encoded by the universal genetic code. The remaining two, <!--del_lnk--> selenocysteine and <!--del_lnk--> pyrrolysine, are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. <!--del_lnk--> Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a <!--del_lnk--> SECIS element, which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a <!--del_lnk--> stop codon. <!--del_lnk--> Pyrrolysine is used by some <!--del_lnk--> methanogenic <!--del_lnk--> archaea in enzymes that they use to produce <a href="../../wp/m/Methane.htm" title="Methane">methane</a>. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a stop codon in other organisms.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Non-standard_amino_acids">Non-standard amino acids</span></h3>
       <p>Aside from the twenty-two standard amino acids, there are a vast number of "non-standard" amino acids. These non-standard amino acids found in proteins are formed by <!--del_lnk--> post-translational modification, which is modification after translation in protein synthesis. These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein; for example, the <!--del_lnk--> carboxylation of <!--del_lnk--> glutamate allows for better binding of <!--del_lnk--> calcium cations, and the <!--del_lnk--> hydroxylation of <!--del_lnk--> proline is critical for maintaining <!--del_lnk--> connective tissues. Another example is the formation of <!--del_lnk--> hypusine in the <!--del_lnk--> translation initiation factor <!--del_lnk--> EIF5A, through modification of a lysine residue. Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a <!--del_lnk--> phospholipid membrane.</p>

       <p>Examples of nonstandard amino acids that are not found in proteins include <!--del_lnk--> lanthionine, <!--del_lnk--> 2-aminoisobutyric acid, <!--del_lnk--> dehydroalanine and the neurotransmitter <!--del_lnk--> gamma-aminobutyric acid. Nonstandard amino acids often occur as intermediates in the <!--del_lnk--> metabolic pathways for standard amino acids &mdash; for example <!--del_lnk--> ornithine and <!--del_lnk--> citrulline occur in the <!--del_lnk--> urea cycle, part of amino acid <!--del_lnk--> catabolism (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of &alpha;-amino acids in biology is the &beta;-amino acid <!--del_lnk--> beta alanine (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of <!--del_lnk--> pantothenic acid (vitamin B<sub>5</sub>), a component of <!--del_lnk--> coenzyme A.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_human_nutrition">In human nutrition</span></h3>
       <p>When taken up into the human body from the diet, the twenty-two standard amino acids are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or oxidized to <a href="../../wp/u/Urea.htm" title="Urea">urea</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> as a source of energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a <!--del_lnk--> transaminase, the amino group is then fed into the <!--del_lnk--> urea cycle. The other product of transamidation is a <!--del_lnk--> keto acid that enters the <!--del_lnk--> citric acid cycle. <!--del_lnk--> Glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through <!--del_lnk--> gluconeogenesis.</p>
       <p>Pyrrolysine trait is restricted to several microbes, and only one organism has both Pyl and Sec. Of the twenty-two standard amino acids, eight are called <!--del_lnk--> essential amino acids because the <!--del_lnk--> human body cannot <!--del_lnk--> synthesize them from other <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_compound.htm" title="Chemical compound">compounds</a> at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food. However, the situation is quite complicated since <!--del_lnk--> cysteine, <!--del_lnk--> taurine, <!--del_lnk--> tyrosine, <!--del_lnk--> histidine and <!--del_lnk--> arginine are semiessential amino acids in children, because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids.</p>

       <p>In humans, non-protein amino acids also have important roles as <!--del_lnk--> metabolic intermediates, such as in the biosynthesis of the <!--del_lnk--> neurotransmitter <!--del_lnk--> gamma-aminobutyric acid. Many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules, for example:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Tryptophan is a precursor of the neurotransmitter <!--del_lnk--> serotonin.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Tyrosine is a precursor of the <!--del_lnk--> neurotransmitter <!--del_lnk--> dopamine.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Glycine is a precursor of <!--del_lnk--> porphyrins such as <!--del_lnk--> heme.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Arginine is a precursor of <!--del_lnk--> nitric oxide.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Ornithine and <!--del_lnk--> S-adenosylmethionine are precursors of <!--del_lnk--> polyamines.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Aspartate, <!--del_lnk--> glycine and <!--del_lnk--> glutamine are precursors of <!--del_lnk--> nucleotides.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Phenylalanine is a precursor of various <!--del_lnk--> phenylpropanoids which are important in plant metabolism.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>However, not all of the functions of other abundant non-standard amino acids are known, for example <!--del_lnk--> taurine is a major amino acid in muscle and brain tissues, but although many functions have been proposed, its precise role in the body has not been determined.</p>
       <p>Some non-standard amino acids are used as <!--del_lnk--> defenses against herbivores in plants. For example <!--del_lnk--> canavanine is an analogue of <!--del_lnk--> arginine that is found in many <!--del_lnk--> legumes, and in particularly large amounts in <i><!--del_lnk--> Canavalia gladiata</i> (sword bean). This amino acid protects the plants from predators such as <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a> and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing. The non-protein amino acid <!--del_lnk--> mimosine is found in other species of legume, particularly <i><!--del_lnk--> Leucaena leucocephala</i>. This compound is an analogue of <!--del_lnk--> tyrosine and can poison animals that graze on these plants.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses_in_technology">Uses in technology</span></h2>
       <p>Amino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry but their main use is as additives to <!--del_lnk--> animal feed. This is necessary since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as <a href="../../wp/s/Soybean.htm" title="Soybean">soybeans</a>, either have low levels or lack some of the <!--del_lnk--> essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. The <!--del_lnk--> food industry is also a major consumer of amino acids, particularly <!--del_lnk--> glutamic acid, which is used as a <!--del_lnk--> flavor enhancer, and <!--del_lnk--> Aspartame (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) as a low-calorie <!--del_lnk--> artificial sweetener. The remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of <!--del_lnk--> drugs and <!--del_lnk--> cosmetics.</p>

       <p>Since 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into protein by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl &ndash; tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring <!--del_lnk--> protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.</p>

       <p>Amino acids are important as low-cost <!--del_lnk--> feedstocks. These compounds are used in <!--del_lnk--> chiral pool synthesis as <!--del_lnk--> enantiomerically-pure building blocks.</p>
       <p>Amino acids have been investigated as precursors <!--del_lnk--> chiral catalysts, e.g. for asymmetric <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogenation.htm" title="Hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a> reactions, although no commercial applications exist.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biodegradable_plastics">Biodegradable plastics</span></h3>
       <p>Amino acids are under development as components of a range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally-friendly packaging and in medicine in <!--del_lnk--> drug delivery and the construction of <!--del_lnk--> prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is <!--del_lnk--> polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable <!--del_lnk--> diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to <!--del_lnk--> chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-<!--del_lnk--> scaling agent and a <!--del_lnk--> corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid <!--del_lnk--> tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic <a href="../../wp/p/Phenol.htm" title="Phenol">phenols</a> such as <!--del_lnk--> bisphenol A in the manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> polycarbonates.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reactions">Reactions</span></h2>
       <p>As amino acids have both a primary <a href="../../wp/a/Amine.htm" title="Amine">amine</a> group and a primary <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Carboxylic_acid.htm" title="Carboxyl">carboxyl</a> group, these chemicals can undergo most of the reactions associated with these functional groups. These include <!--del_lnk--> nucleophilic addition, <!--del_lnk--> amide bond formation and <!--del_lnk--> imine formation for the amine group and <!--del_lnk--> esterification, <!--del_lnk--> amide bond formation and <!--del_lnk--> decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The multiple side chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions. The types of these reactions are determined by the groups on these side chains and are therefore different between the various types of amino acid.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_synthesis">Chemical synthesis</span></h3>
       <p>Several methods exist to synthesize amino acids. One of the oldest methods, begins with the <!--del_lnk--> bromination at the &alpha;-carbon of a carboxyic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. Alternatively, the <!--del_lnk--> Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with <!--del_lnk--> potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an &alpha;-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a &alpha;-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, while substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using <a href="../../wp/k/Ketone.htm" title="Ketone">ketones</a>, instead of aldehydes, gives &alpha;,&alpha;-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives <!--del_lnk--> racemic mixtures of &alpha;-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries  or asymmetric catalysts  have been developed.</p>
       <p>Currently the most adopted method is an <!--del_lnk--> automated synthesis on a solid support (e.g. <a href="../../wp/p/Polystyrene.htm" title="Polystyrene">polystyrene</a> beads), using <!--del_lnk--> protecting groups (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Fmoc and <!--del_lnk--> t-Boc) and activating groups (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> DCC and <!--del_lnk--> DIC).</p>

          <div class="magnify"><a class="internal" href="../../images/999/99936.png.htm" title="Enlarge"><img alt="" height="11" src="../../images/1x1white.gif" title="This image is not present because of licensing restrictions" width="15" /></a></div> The condensation of two amino acids to form a <!--del_lnk--> peptide bond</div>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>As both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This <!--del_lnk--> polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This <!--del_lnk--> condensation reaction yields the newly formed <!--del_lnk--> peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a <!--del_lnk--> transfer RNA molecule through an <!--del_lnk--> ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an <a href="../../wp/a/Adenosine_triphosphate.htm" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a>-dependent reaction carried out by an <!--del_lnk--> aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the <!--del_lnk--> ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As a result of this mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving towards their C-terminus.</p>
       <p>However, not all peptide bonds are formed in this way. In a few cases, peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide <!--del_lnk--> glutathione is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step <!--del_lnk--> gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses <!--del_lnk--> cysteine and <!--del_lnk--> glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side-chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with <!--del_lnk--> glycine by <!--del_lnk--> glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.</p>
       <p>In chemistry, peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions. One of the most used in <!--del_lnk--> solid-phase peptide synthesis, which uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support. The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using <!--del_lnk--> combinatorial chemistry) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through <!--del_lnk--> high-throughput screening.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biosynthesis_and_catabolism">Biosynthesis and catabolism</span></h3>
       <p>In plants, nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses <!--del_lnk--> transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis too. Transaminases are also involved in breaking down amino acids. Degrading an amino acid often involves moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the <!--del_lnk--> urea cycle and is excreted in the form of <a href="../../wp/u/Urea.htm" title="Urea">urea</a>. However, amino acid degradation can produce <!--del_lnk--> uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, <!--del_lnk--> serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia.</p>
       <p>Nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids. For example, <!--del_lnk--> homocysteine is formed through the <!--del_lnk--> transsulfuration pathway or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite <!--del_lnk--> S-adenosyl methionine, while <!--del_lnk--> hydroxyproline is made by a <!--del_lnk--> posttranslational modification of <!--del_lnk--> proline.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Microorganisms and plants can synthesize many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make <!--del_lnk--> 2-aminoisobutyric acid and <!--del_lnk--> lanthionine, which is a sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine. Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic <!--del_lnk--> lantibiotics such as <!--del_lnk--> alamethicin. While in plants, <!--del_lnk--> 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in the production of the plant hormone <a href="../../wp/e/Ethylene.htm#Ethylene_as_a_plant_hormone" title="Ethylene">ethylene</a>.</p>

       <p>The 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, <!--del_lnk--> hydrophilicity or <!--del_lnk--> hydrophobicity, size and functional groups. These properties are important for <!--del_lnk--> protein structure and <!--del_lnk--> protein&ndash;protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe and Trp) buried in the middle of the protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. The <!--del_lnk--> integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed <!--del_lnk--> hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the <!--del_lnk--> lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some <!--del_lnk--> peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. Similarly, proteins that have to bind to positively-charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like <!--del_lnk--> glutamate and <!--del_lnk--> aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively-charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like <!--del_lnk--> lysine and <!--del_lnk--> arginine. There are different <!--del_lnk--> hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.</p>
       <p>Some amino acids have special properties such as <!--del_lnk--> cysteine, that can form covalent <!--del_lnk--> disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues, <!--del_lnk--> proline that forms <!--del_lnk--> a cycle to the polypeptide backbone, and <!--del_lnk--> glycine that is more flexible than other amino acids.</p>
       <p>Many proteins undergo a range of <!--del_lnk--> posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic <!--del_lnk--> lipoproteins, or hydrophilic <!--del_lnk--> glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid <!--del_lnk--> palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.</p>

       <p><b>Unk</b> is sometimes used instead of <b>Xaa</b>, but is less standard.</p>
       <p>Additionally, many non-standard amino acids have a specific code. For example, several peptide drugs, such as <!--del_lnk--> Bortezomib or <!--del_lnk--> MG132 are <!--del_lnk--> artificially synthesized and retain their <!--del_lnk--> protecting groups, which have specific codes. Bortezomib is <!--del_lnk--> Pyz-Phe-boroLeu and MG132 is <!--del_lnk--> Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. Additionally, To aid in the analysis of protein structure, <!--del_lnk--> photocrosslinking amino acid analogues are available. These include photoleucine (<b>pLeu</b>) and photomethionine (<b>pMet</b>).</p>
