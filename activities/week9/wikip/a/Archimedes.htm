       <p><b>Archimedes of Syracuse</b> (<a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="grc"><!--del_lnk--> &#x1F08;&rho;&chi;&iota;&mu;&#x3AE;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>; <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span style="white-space:nowrap;">&thinsp;287</span>&nbsp;BC&nbsp;&ndash; <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span style="white-space:nowrap;">&thinsp;212</span>&nbsp;BC) was a <!--del_lnk--> Greek mathematician, <!--del_lnk--> physicist, <!--del_lnk--> engineer, <!--del_lnk--> inventor, and <!--del_lnk--> astronomer. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading <!--del_lnk--> scientists in <!--del_lnk--> classical antiquity. Among his advances in <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> are the foundations of <!--del_lnk--> hydrostatics, <!--del_lnk--> statics and an explanation of the principle of the <!--del_lnk--> lever. He is credited with designing innovative <!--del_lnk--> machines, including <!--del_lnk--> siege engines and the <!--del_lnk--> screw pump that bears his name. Modern experiments have tested claims that Archimedes designed machines capable of lifting attacking ships out of the water and setting ships on fire using an array of mirrors.</p>
       <p>Archimedes is generally considered to be the greatest <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematician.htm" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time. He used the <!--del_lnk--> method of exhaustion to calculate the <a href="../../wp/a/Area.htm" title="Area">area</a> under the arc of a <!--del_lnk--> parabola with the <!--del_lnk--> summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of <a href="../../wp/p/Pi.htm" title="Pi">pi</a>. He also defined the <!--del_lnk--> spiral bearing his name, formulae for the <a href="../../wp/v/Volume.htm" title="Volume">volumes</a> of <!--del_lnk--> surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers.</p>
       <p>Archimedes died during the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Syracuse when he was killed by a <!--del_lnk--> Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. <!--del_lnk--> Cicero describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a <a href="../../wp/s/Sphere.htm" title="Sphere">sphere</a> <!--del_lnk--> inscribed within a <!--del_lnk--> cylinder. Archimedes had proven that the sphere has two thirds of the volume and surface area of the cylinder (including the bases of the latter), and regarded this as the greatest of his mathematical achievements.</p>
       <p>Unlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from <a href="../../wp/a/Alexandria.htm" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until <i>c.</i> 530&nbsp;AD by <!--del_lnk--> Isidore of Miletus, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by <!--del_lnk--> Eutocius in the sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the <!--del_lnk--> Archimedes Palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Archimedes was born <i>c</i>. 287&nbsp;BC in the seaport city of <!--del_lnk--> Syracuse, Sicily, at that time a self-governing <!--del_lnk--> colony in <!--del_lnk--> Magna Graecia. The date of birth is based on a statement by the <!--del_lnk--> Byzantine Greek historian <!--del_lnk--> John Tzetzes that Archimedes lived for 75 years. In <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sand Reckoner</i>, Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an <!--del_lnk--> astronomer about whom nothing is known. <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch wrote in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Parallel Lives</i> that Archimedes was related to King <!--del_lnk--> Hiero II, the ruler of Syracuse. A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children. During his youth, Archimedes may have studied in <a href="../../wp/a/Alexandria.htm" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egypt</a>, where <!--del_lnk--> Conon of Samos and <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes of Cyrene were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his friend, while two of his works (<i><!--del_lnk--> The Method of Mechanical Theorems</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Cattle Problem</i>) have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.</p>
       <p>Archimedes died <i>c</i>. 212&nbsp;BC during the <!--del_lnk--> Second Punic War, when Roman forces under General <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Claudius Marcellus captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year-long <a href="../../wp/s/Siege.htm" title="Siege">siege</a>. According to the popular account given by <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch, Archimedes was contemplating a <!--del_lnk--> mathematical diagram when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a <span class="nowrap">lesser-known</span> account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he not be harmed.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The last words attributed to Archimedes are "Do not disturb my circles" (<a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el">&mu;&#x3AE; &mu;&omicron;&upsilon; &tau;&omicron;&#x1F7A;&sigmaf; &kappa;&#x3CD;&kappa;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &tau;&#x3AC;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&tau;&epsilon;</span>), a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier. This quote is often given in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> as "<!--del_lnk--> Noli turbare circulos meos," but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by Plutarch.</p>
       <p>The tomb of Archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, consisting of a <a href="../../wp/s/Sphere.htm" title="Sphere">sphere</a> and a <!--del_lnk--> cylinder of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75&nbsp;BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman <!--del_lnk--> orator <!--del_lnk--> Cicero was serving as <!--del_lnk--> quaestor in <!--del_lnk--> Sicily. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, but none of the locals was able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. A tomb discovered in a hotel courtyard in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but its location today is unknown.</p>
       <p>The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome. The account of the siege of Syracuse given by <!--del_lnk--> Polybius in his <i>Universal History</i> was written around seventy years after Archimedes' death, and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and <!--del_lnk--> Livy. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The most widely known <!--del_lnk--> anecdote about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to <!--del_lnk--> Vitruvius, a <!--del_lnk--> votive crown for a temple had been made for King Hiero II, who had supplied the pure <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith. Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its <a href="../../wp/d/Density.htm" title="Density">density</a>. While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the <a href="../../wp/v/Volume.htm" title="Volume">volume</a> of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible, so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying "<!--del_lnk--> Eureka!" (<a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el">"&epsilon;&#x1F55;&rho;&eta;&kappa;&alpha;</span>!," meaning "I have found it!"). The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.</p>
       <p>The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes. Moreover, the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question, due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement. Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in <!--del_lnk--> hydrostatics as <!--del_lnk--> Archimedes' principle, which he describes in his treatise <i>On Floating Bodies</i>. This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a <!--del_lnk--> buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold reference sample, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly. <a href="../../wp/g/Galileo_Galilei.htm" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</a> considered it "probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself." In a 12th century text titled <i>Mappae clavicula</i> there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used, and thus solve the problem. The Latin poem <i>Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris</i> of the 4th or 5th century describes the use of a hydrostatic balance to solve the problem of the crown, and attributes the method to Archimedes.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer <!--del_lnk--> Athenaeus of Naucratis described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Syracusia</i>, which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The <i>Syracusia</i> is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity. According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a <!--del_lnk--> gymnasium and a temple dedicated to the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Aphrodite among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the <!--del_lnk--> Archimedes screw was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a <span class="nowrap">low-lying</span> body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes screw described in Roman times by <!--del_lnk--> Vitruvius may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the <!--del_lnk--> Hanging Gardens of Babylon. The world's first seagoing <!--del_lnk--> steamship with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Propeller_%2528marine%2529.htm" title="Propeller">screw propeller</a> was the <i><!--del_lnk--> SS Archimedes</i>, which was launched in 1839 and named in honour of Archimedes and his work on the screw.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Claw_of_Archimedes">Claw of Archimedes</span></h3>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Claw of Archimedes is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as "the ship shaker," the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled <i>Superweapons of the Ancient World</i> built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Heat_ray">Heat ray</span></h3>
       <div class="thumb tright">

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The 2nd century AD author <!--del_lnk--> Lucian wrote that during the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Syracuse (<i>c.</i> 214&ndash;212&nbsp;BC), Archimedes destroyed enemy ships with fire. Centuries later, <!--del_lnk--> Anthemius of Tralles mentions <!--del_lnk--> burning-glasses as Archimedes' weapon. The device, sometimes called the "Archimedes heat ray", was used to focus sunlight onto approaching ships, causing them to catch fire.</p>
       <p>This purported weapon has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance. <!--del_lnk--> Ren&eacute; Descartes rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes. It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished <!--del_lnk--> bronze or <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship. This would have used the principle of the <!--del_lnk--> parabolic reflector in a manner similar to a <!--del_lnk--> solar furnace.</p>
       <p>A test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the <!--del_lnk--> Skaramagas naval base outside <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1&nbsp;m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood <span class="nowrap">mock-up</span> of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160&nbsp;feet (50&nbsp;m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of <!--del_lnk--> tar paint, which may have aided combustion. A coating of tar would have been commonplace on ships in the classical era.</p>
       <p>In October 2005 a group of students from the <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Institute of Technology carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30&nbsp;cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a <span class="nowrap">mock-up</span> wooden ship at a range of around 100&nbsp;feet (30&nbsp;m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show <i><!--del_lnk--> MythBusters</i>, using a wooden fishing boat in <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco.htm" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its <!--del_lnk--> autoignition temperature, which is around 300 &deg;C (570&nbsp;&deg;F).</p>
       <p>When <i>MythBusters</i> broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of "busted" (or failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors. <i>MythBusters</i> also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.</p>
       <p>In December 2010, <i>MythBusters</i> again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition featuring <a href="../../wp/b/Barack_Obama.htm" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>, entitled <i>President's Challenge</i>. Several experiments were carried out, including a large scale test with 500 schoolchildren aiming mirrors at a <span class="nowrap">mock-up</span> of a Roman sailing ship 400&nbsp;feet (120&nbsp;m) away. In all of the experiments, the sail failed to reach the 210 &deg;C (410&nbsp;&deg;F) required to catch fire, and the verdict was again "busted". The show concluded that a more likely effect of the mirrors would have been blinding, dazzling, or distracting the crew of the ship.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_discoveries_and_inventions">Other discoveries and inventions</span></h3>
       <p>While Archimedes did not invent the <!--del_lnk--> lever, he gave an explanation of the principle involved in his work <i>On the Equilibrium of Planes</i>. Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the <!--del_lnk--> Peripatetic school of the followers of <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and are sometimes attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Archytas. According to <!--del_lnk--> Pappus of Alexandria, Archimedes' work on levers caused him to remark: "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth." (<a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el">&delta;&#x1FF6;&sigmaf; &mu;&omicron;&iota; &pi;&#x1FB6; &sigma;&tau;&#x1FF6; &kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76; &tau;&#x1F70;&nu; &gamma;&#x1FB6;&nu; &kappa;&iota;&nu;&#x3AC;&sigma;&omega;</span>) Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed <!--del_lnk--> block-and-tackle <!--del_lnk--> pulley systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of <!--del_lnk--> leverage to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move. Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the <!--del_lnk--> catapult, and with inventing the <!--del_lnk--> odometer during the <!--del_lnk--> First Punic War. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Cicero (106&ndash;43&nbsp;BC) mentions Archimedes briefly in his <!--del_lnk--> dialogue <i><!--del_lnk--> De re publica</i>, which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129&nbsp;BC. After the capture of Syracuse <i>c.</i> 212&nbsp;BC, General <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Claudius Marcellus is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by <a href="../../wp/t/Thales.htm" title="Thales">Thales of Miletus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Eudoxus of Cnidus. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by <!--del_lnk--> Gaius Sulpicius Gallus to <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Furius Philus, who described it thus:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">Hanc sphaeram Gallus cum moveret, fiebat ut soli luna totidem conversionibus in aere illo quot diebus in ipso caelo succederet, ex quo et in caelo sphaera solis fieret eadem illa defectio, et incideret luna tum in eam metam quae esset umbra terrae, cum sol e regione.&nbsp;&mdash; When Gallus moved the globe, it happened that the Moon followed the Sun by as many turns on that bronze contrivance as in the sky itself, from which also in the sky the Sun's globe became to have that same eclipse, and the Moon came then to that position which was its shadow on the Earth, when the Sun was in line.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>This is a description of a <!--del_lnk--> planetarium or <!--del_lnk--> orrery. <!--del_lnk--> Pappus of Alexandria stated that Archimedes had written a manuscript (now lost) on the construction of these mechanisms entitled <span class="nowrap"><i><!--del_lnk--> On Sphere-Making</i></span>. Modern research in this area has been focused on the <!--del_lnk--> Antikythera mechanism, another device from classical antiquity that was probably designed for the same purpose. Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of <!--del_lnk--> differential gearing. This was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient Greeks.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Archimedes was able to use <!--del_lnk--> infinitesimals in a way that is similar to modern <a href="../../wp/i/Integral.htm" title="Integral">integral calculus</a>. Through proof by contradiction (<!--del_lnk--> reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the <!--del_lnk--> method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of &pi;. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Measurement of a Circle</i> he did this by drawing a larger <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Hexagon.htm" title="Regular hexagon">regular hexagon</a> outside a <a href="../../wp/c/Circle.htm" title="Circle">circle</a> and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of &pi; lay between 3<span class="frac nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub></span> (approximately 3.1429) and 3<span class="frac nowrap"><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub></span> (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the <a href="../../wp/a/Area.htm" title="Area">area</a> of a circle was equal to &pi; multiplied by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Square.htm" title="Square (geometry)">square</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> radius of the circle (&pi;r<sup>2</sup>). In <i><!--del_lnk--> On the Sphere and Cylinder</i>, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the <!--del_lnk--> Archimedean property of real numbers.</p>
       <p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Measurement of a Circle</i>, Archimedes gives the value of the <a href="../../wp/s/Square_root.htm" title="Square root">square root</a> of 3 as lying between <span class="frac nowrap"><sup>265</sup>&frasl;<sub>153</sub></span> (approximately 1.7320261) and <span class="frac nowrap"><sup>1351</sup>&frasl;<sub>780</sub></span> (approximately 1.7320512). The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused <!--del_lnk--> John Wallis to remark that he was: "as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results."

He discovered that it was a <!--del_lnk--> palimpsest, a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as <!--del_lnk--> vellum was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes. The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On October 29, 1998 it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $2 million at <!--del_lnk--> Christie's in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York</a>. The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of <i>On Floating Bodies</i> in the original Greek. It is the only known source of <i>The Method of Mechanical Theorems</i>, referred to by <!--del_lnk--> Suidas and thought to have been lost forever. <i>Stomachion</i> was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts. The palimpsest is now stored at the <!--del_lnk--> Walters Art Museum in <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore, <!--del_lnk--> Maryland, where it has been subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> and <span class="nowrap"><!--del_lnk--> x-ray</span> <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a> to read the overwritten text.</p>
       <p>The treatises in the Archimedes Palimpsest are: <i>On the Equilibrium of Planes, On Spirals, <!--del_lnk--> Measurement of a Circle, On the Sphere and the Cylinder, On Floating Bodies, The Method of Mechanical Theorems</i> and <i>Stomachion</i>.</p>
