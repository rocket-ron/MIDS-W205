       <p><i><b>Anne of Green Gables</b></i> is a book by <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canadian</a> author <!--del_lnk--> Lucy Maud Montgomery published in 1908. It was written as fiction for readers of all ages, but in recent decades has been considered a children's book. Montgomery found her inspiration for the book on an old piece of paper that she had written at a young age, describing a couple that were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of a boy, yet decided to keep her. Montgomery also drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural <!--del_lnk--> Prince Edward Island. Montgomery used a photograph of <!--del_lnk--> Evelyn Nesbit, clipped from an American magazine and pasted on the wall above her writing desk, as the model for <!--del_lnk--> Anne Shirley, the book's main character.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot_summary">Plot summary</span></h2>
       <p>Marilla Cuthbert and Matthew Cuthbert, middle-aged siblings who live together at Green Gables, a farm in <!--del_lnk--> Avonlea, on <!--del_lnk--> Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a boy from an <!--del_lnk--> orphan asylum in <!--del_lnk--> Nova Scotia as a helper on their farm. Through a series of mishaps, what ends up under their roof is a precocious girl of eleven named <!--del_lnk--> Anne Shirley. Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her pale countenance dotted with <!--del_lnk--> freckles, and with her long <!--del_lnk--> braids of <!--del_lnk--> red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne takes much joy in life, and adapts quickly, thriving in the environment of Prince Edward Island.</p>
       <p>The rest of the book recounts her continued education at school, where she excels in studies very quickly, her budding literary ambitions and her friendships with people such as Diana Barry (her best friend, "bosom friend" as Anne fondly calls her), Jane Andrews, Ruby Gillis, and her rivalry with <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert Blythe, who teases her about her red hair and for that acquires her hatred, although he apologizes many times. They compete in class and Anne one day realizes she no longer hates Gilbert, but will not admit it. The book also follows her misadventures in quiet, old-fashioned <!--del_lnk--> Avonlea. These adventures include her games with her friendship group (Diana, Jane and Ruby), her rivalries with the Pye sisters (Gertie and Josie) and her domestic mistakes such as dyeing her hair green. Anne, along with Gilbert, Ruby, Josie, Jane and a couple of others, eventually goes to the Queen's Academy and obtains a teaching license in one year, in addition to winning the Avery Prize in English, which allows her to pursue a <!--del_lnk--> B.A. at Redmond College. The book ends with Matthew's death, caused by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Myocardial_infarction.htm" title="Heart attack">heart attack</a> after learning of the loss of all his and Marilla's money. Anne shows her devotion to Marilla and Green Gables by giving up the Avery Prize, deciding to stay at home and help Marilla, whose <!--del_lnk--> eyesight is diminishing, and teaching at the Carmody school, the nearest school available. To show his friendship, Gilbert Blythe gives up his teaching position in the Avonlea School to work at White Sands School instead, thus enabling Anne to teach at the Avonlea School and stay at Green Gables all through the week. After this kind act, Anne fully forgives Gilbert and they become best friends.</p>

       <p>Many tourist attractions on Prince Edward Island have been developed based on Anne. The <!--del_lnk--> Green Gables farmhouse which Montgomery drew her inspiration from, is located in <!--del_lnk--> Cavendish, Prince Edward Island.</p>
       <p>Balsam Hollow and the forest that inspired the Haunted Woods described in the book are also located in the vicinity. Each summer, the <!--del_lnk--> musicals <i><!--del_lnk--> Anne of Green Gables</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Anne &amp; Gilbert</i> are performed at theatres in Prince Edward Island.</p>
       <p>The popularity of Anne has extended into many countries and <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> has been translated into 36 languages. Tourism from Anne fans is an important part of the Island economy. The novel is very popular in <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and Anne is an icon there. Many Japanese couples have wedding ceremonies on the grounds of the Green Gables farm and some girls arrive with red-dyed hair and pigtails, to look like Anne.</p>
