       <p>An <b>electronic amplifier</b> is a device for increasing the <!--del_lnk--> power and/or <!--del_lnk--> amplitude of a <!--del_lnk--> signal. It does this by taking power from a <!--del_lnk--> power supply and controlling the output to match the input signal shape but with a larger amplitude. In this sense, an amplifier may be considered as modulating the output of the power supply.</p>

       <p>Amplifiers can be specified according to their input and output properties. They have some kind of <b>gain</b>, i.e. a factor between the output and input signal. The gain may be specified as "output voltage/input voltage", "output power/input voltage" or any other combination of current, voltage and power.</p>
       <p>In most cases an amplifier should be linear, that is the gain should be constant for any combination of input and output signal. If the gain is not linear, e.g. by clipping the output signal at the limits of its capabilities, the output signal is distorted.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification_of_amplifier_stages_and_systems">Classification of amplifier stages and systems</span></h2>
       <p>There are many alternative classifications that address different aspects of amplifier designs, and they all express some particular perspective relating the design parameters to the objectives of the circuit. Amplifier design is always a compromise of numerous factors, such as cost, power consumption, real-world device imperfections, and a multitude of performance specifications. Below are several different approaches to classification:</p>

       <p>Electronic amplifiers use two variables: current and voltage. Either can be used as input, and either as output leading to four types of amplifier.

       <p>In practice the ideal impedances are only approximated. For any particular circuit, a small-signal analysis often is used to find the impedance actually achieved. A small-signal AC test current <i>I<sub>x</sub></i> is applied to the input or output node, all external sources are set to zero, and the corresponding alternating voltage <i>V<sub>x</sub></i> across the test current source determines the impedance seen at that node as <i>R = V<sub>x</sub> / I<sub>x</sub></i>.</p>
       <p>Amplifiers designed to attach to a <!--del_lnk--> transmission line at input and/or output, especially <!--del_lnk--> RF amplifiers, do not fit into this classification approach. Rather than dealing with voltage or current individually, they ideally couple with an input and/or output impedance matched to the transmission line impedance, that is, match <i>ratios</i> of voltage to current. Many real RF amplifiers come close to this ideal. Although, for a given appropriate source and load impedance, RF amplifiers can be characterized as amplifying voltage or current, they fundamentally are amplifying power.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Common_terminal">Common terminal</span></h3>
       <p>One set of classifications for amplifiers is based on which device terminal is common to both the input and the output circuit. In the case of <!--del_lnk--> bipolar junction transistors, the three classes are <!--del_lnk--> common emitter, <!--del_lnk--> common base, and <!--del_lnk--> common collector. For <!--del_lnk--> field-effect transistors, the corresponding configurations are <!--del_lnk--> common source, <!--del_lnk--> common gate, and <!--del_lnk--> common drain; for triode vacuum devices, common cathode, common grid, and common plate.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Unilateral_or_bilateral">Unilateral or bilateral</span></h3>
       <p>When an amplifier has an output that exhibits no feedback to its input side, it is called <b>unilateral</b>. One consequence is the amplifier has an input impedance that is independent of the load attached to the amplifier, and an output impedance that is independent of the signal source driving the amplifier.</p>
       <p>The opposite case is the <b>bilateral</b> amplifier, where feedback connects the output to the input side of the amplifier. Such feedback often is deliberate, for example <!--del_lnk--> negative feedback often is used to tailor amplifier behaviour. However, at least as often, feedback is both undesirable and unavoidable; introduced, for example, by parasitic elements like inherent, undesirable capacitances in transistors that couple input to output. In any case, a bilateral amplifier has an input impedance that depends upon the load attached to the amplifier, and an output impedance that depends on the source driving the amplifier.</p>
       <p>Linear unilateral and bilateral amplifiers can be represented by <!--del_lnk--> two-port networks. Most amplifiers are bilateral to some degree, however they may often be modeled as unilateral under certain operating conditions to simplify the analysis (see the <!--del_lnk--> common base article for an example).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Inverting_or_non-inverting">Inverting or non-inverting</span></h3>
       <p>Another way to classify amps is the phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal. An <b>inverting</b> amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, an inversion or mirror image of the input as seen on an <!--del_lnk--> oscilloscope). A <b>non-inverting</b> amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An <b><!--del_lnk--> emitter follower</b> is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal.</p>
       <p>This description can apply to a single stage of an amplifier, or to a complete amplifier system.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Function">Function</span></h3>
       <p>Other amplifiers may be classified by their function or output characteristics. These functional descriptions usually apply to complete amplifier systems or sub-systems and rarely to individual stages.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>A <b>servo amplifier</b> indicates an integrated <!--del_lnk--> feedback loop to actively control the output at some desired level. A <b>DC <!--del_lnk--> servo</b> indicates use at frequencies down to DC levels, where the rapid fluctuations of an audio or RF signal do not occur. These are often used in mechanical actuators, or devices such as <!--del_lnk--> DC motors that must maintain a constant speed or <!--del_lnk--> torque. An <b>AC servo</b> amp can do this for some ac motors.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>A <b>linear</b> amplifier responds to different frequency components independently, and does not generate harmonic distortion or intermodulation distortion. A <b>nonlinear</b> amplifier does generate distortion.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>A <b>wideband</b> amplifier has a precise amplification factor over a wide range of frequencies, and is often used to boost signals for relay in communications systems. A <b>narrowband</b> amp is made to amplify only a specific narrow range of frequencies, to the exclusion of other frequencies.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>An <b>RF</b> amplifier refers to an amplifier designed for use in the <a href="../../wp/r/Radio_frequency.htm" title="Radio frequency">radio frequency</a> range of the <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic spectrum, and is often used to increase the sensitivity of a <!--del_lnk--> receiver or the output power of a <!--del_lnk--> transmitter.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>An <b>audio</b> amplifier is designed for use in reproducing <!--del_lnk--> audio frequencies. This category subdivides into small signal amplification, and power amps which are optimised for driving <!--del_lnk--> speakers, sometimes with multiple amps grouped together as separate or bridgeable channels to accommodate different audio reproduction requirements.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>A special type of amplifier is widely used in instruments and for signal processing, among many other varied uses. These are known as <b><!--del_lnk--> operational</b> amplifiers, (or <b>op-amps</b>). This is because this type of amplifier is used in circuits that perform mathematical algorithmic functions, or "operations" on input signals to obtain specific types of output signals. A typical op-amp has differential inputs (one "inverting", one, "non-inverting" relative to the output) and one output. An idealised op-amp has the following characteristics: <ul>
          <li>Infinite input impedance (so as to not load circuitry it is sampling as a control input)</li>
          <li>Zero output impedance</li>
          <li>Infinite gain</li>
          <li>Zero propagation delay</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <dl>
        <dd>The performance of an op-amp with these characteristics would be entirely defined by the (usually passive) components forming a negative feedback loop around it, that is, <i>the amplifier itself has no effect on the output</i>.</dd>
       </dl>
       <dl>
        <dd>Today, op-amps are usually provided as integrated circuits, rather than constructed from discrete components. All real-world op-amps fall short of the idealised specification above &ndash; but some modern components have remarkable performance and come close in some respects.</dd>
       </dl>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interstage_coupling_method">Interstage coupling method</span></h3>
       <p>Amplifiers are sometimes classified by the coupling method of the signal at the input, output, or between stages. Different types of these include:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> R-C coupled amplifier, using a network of resistors and capacitors.</b> By design these amplifiers cannot amplify DC signals as the capacitors block the DC component of the input signal. RC-coupled amplifiers were used very often in circuits with vacuum tubes or discrete transistors. In the days of the integrated circuit a few more transistors on a chip are much cheaper and smaller than a capacitor.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> L-C coupled amplifier, using a network of inductors and capacitors.</b> This kind of amplifier is most often used in selective radio-frequency circuits.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Transformer coupled amplifier, using a transformer to match impedances or to decouple parts of the circuits.</b> Quite often LC-coupled and transformer-coupled amplifiers cannot be distinguished as a transformer is some kind of inductor.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Direct coupled amplifier, using no impedance and bias matching components. This class of amplifier was very uncommon in the vacuum tube days when the anode (output) voltage was at several 100 V plus and the grid (input) voltage at a few voltages minus. So they were only used if the gain was specified down to DC, e.g. in an oscilloscope. These days developers are hard pressed to use direcly coupled amplifiers whenever possible.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Also see: <!--del_lnk--> Multistage amplifiers.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Frequency_range">Frequency range</span></h3>
       <p>Depending on the frequency range and other properties amplifiers are designed according to different principles.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Frequency ranges down to DC are only used when this property is needed. DC amplification leads to specific complications that are avoided if possible.</li>
        <li>Depending on the frequency range specified different design principles must be used. Up to the MHz range only "discrete" properties need be considered, e.g. a terminal has an input impedance.</li>
        <li>As soon as any connection within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength of the highest specified frequency (e.g. 3 m at 100 MHz) design properties radically change. For example a specified length and width of a <!--del_lnk--> PCB trace can be used as a selective or impedance-matching entity.</li>
        <li>Above a few 100 MHz it gets difficult to use discrete elements, especially inductors. In most cases PCB traces of very closely definded shapes are used instead.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Type_of_load">Type of load</span></h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Untuned - (a) audio (b) video</li>
        <li>Tuned (RF amps) - used for amplifying a single radio frequency or band of frequencies</li>
       </ul>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Implementation">Implementation</span></h2>
       <p>Amplifiers are implemented using <b>active elements</b> of different kinds:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The first active elements were relays. They were for example used in trans-continental telegraph lines: A weak current was used to switch the voltage of a battery to the outgoing line.</li>
        <li>Up to the 1960s most amplifiers used vacuum tubes ("valves" in the UK). Today tubes are only generally used for very high-power, high-frequency amplifiers and for specialist audio applications, in which field they have recently achieved a new popularity. Many broadcasting transmitters still use vacuum tubes. Additionally, their imperviousness to electromagnetic flash damage may have led to their retention in certain defence contexts.</li>
        <li>In the 1960s the transistor took over, enabling for example the transistor radio. These days "discrete" transistors are still used in high-power amplifiers and in specialist audio devices.</li>
        <li>Beginning in the 1970s more and more transistors were connected on a single chip therefore creating the <a href="../../wp/i/Integrated_circuit.htm" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuit</a>. Nearly all amplifiers commercially available today are based on integrated circuits.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>For exotic purposes other active elements have been used. For example in the early days of the communication satellite <!--del_lnk--> parametric amplifiers" were used. The core circuit was a diode whose capacity was changed by an RF signal created locally. Under certain conditions this RF signal provided energy that was modulated by the extremely weak satellite signal received at the earth station. The operating principle of a parametric amplifier is somewhat similar to the principle by which children keep their swings in motion: As long as the swing moves you only need to change a "parameter" of the swinging entity, e.g. you must move your centre of gravity up and down. In our case the capacity of the diode is changed periodically.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Power_amplifier_classes">Power amplifier classes</span></h2>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Angle_of_flow_or_conduction_angle">Angle of flow or conduction angle</span></h4>
       <p>Power amplifier circuits (output stages) are classified as A, B, AB and C for <!--del_lnk--> analog designs, and class D and E for switching designs based upon the conduction angle or 'angle of flow' &Theta; of the input signal through the amplifying device, that is, the portion of the input signal cycle during which the amplifying device conducts. The image of the conduction angle is derived from amplifying a sinodial signal. (If the device is always on, &Theta; = 360&deg;.) The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier <!--del_lnk--> power efficiency. The various classes are introduced below, followed by more detailed discussion under individual headings later on.</p>
       <dl>
        <dt><b>Class A</b></dt>
        <dd>100% of the input signal is used (conduction angle &Theta; = 360&deg; or 2&pi;, i.e. the active element works in its linear range all of the time). Where efficiency is not a consideration, most small signal linear amplifiers are designed as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Amplifier.htm" title="Class A amplifier">Class A</a>, which means that the output devices are always in the conduction region. Class A amplifiers are typically more linear and less complex than other types, but are very inefficient. This type of amplifier is most commonly used in small-signal stages or for low-power applications (such as driving headphones).</dd>
       </dl>
       <dl>
        <dt><b>Class B</b></dt>
        <dd>50% of the input signal is used (&Theta; = 180&deg; or &pi;, i.e. the active element works in its linear range half of the time and is more or less turned off for the other half). In most <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Amplifier.htm" title="Class B amplifier">Class B</a>, there are two output devices (or sets of output devices), each of which conducts alternately (push&ndash;pull) for exactly 180 deg (or half cycle) of the input signal; selective RF amplifiers can also be implemented using a single active element.</dd>
       </dl>
       <dl>
        <dd>These amplifiers are subject to <i>crossover distortion</i> if the handoff from one active element to the other is not perfect, as when two complimentary transistors (i.e. one PNP, one NPN) are connected as two emitter followers with their base and emitter terminals in common, requiring the base voltage to slew across the region where both devices are turned off.</dd>
       </dl>
       <dl>
        <dt><b>Class AB</b></dt>
        <dd>Here the two active elements conduct more than half of the time as a means to reduce the cross-over distortions of Class B amplifiers. In the example of the complementary emitter followers a bias network allows for more or less quiescent current thus providing an operating point somewhere between Class A and Class B. Sometimes a figure is added, e.g. AB1 or AB2, with higher figures implying a higher quiescent current and therefore more of the properties of Class A.</dd>
       </dl>
       <dl>
        <dt><b>Class D</b></dt>
       </dl>
       <dl>
        <dd>These use switching to achieve a very high power efficiency (more than 90% in modern designs). By allowing each output device to be either fully on or off, losses are minimized. The analog output is created by <!--del_lnk--> pulse-width modulation, i.e. the active element is switched on for shorter or longer intervals instead of modifying its resistor. There are more complicated switching schemes like <!--del_lnk--> sigma-delta modulation, to improve some performance aspects like lower distortions or better efficiency.</dd>
       </dl>
       <dl>
        <dt><b>Other classes</b></dt>
        <dd>There are several other amplifier classes, although they are mainly variations of the previous classes. For example, Class H and Class G amplifiers are marked by variation of the supply rails (in discrete steps or in a continuous fashion, respectively) following the input signal. Wasted heat on the output devices can be reduced as excess voltage is kept to a minimum. The amplifier that is fed with these rails itself can be of any class. These kinds of amplifiers are more complex, and are mainly used for specialized applications, such as very high-power units. Also, Class E and Class F amplifiers are commonly described in literature for radio frequencies applications where efficiency of the traditional classes deviate substantially from their ideal values. These classes use harmonic tuning of their output networks to achieve higher efficiency and can be considered a subset of Class C due to their conduction angle characteristics.</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>More detail on the various classes is provided below.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Class_A">Class A</span></h3>
       <p>Class A amplifying devices operate over the whole of the input cycle such that the output signal is an exact scaled-up replica of the input with no clipping. Class A amplifiers are the usual means of implementing small-signal amplifiers. They are not very efficient; <b>a theoretical maximum of 50% is obtainable with inductive output coupling and only 25% with capacitive coupling</b>.</p>
       <p>In a Class A circuit, the amplifying element is biased so the device is always conducting to some extent, and is operated over the most linear portion of its characteristic curve (known as its <!--del_lnk--> transfer characteristic or <!--del_lnk--> transconductance curve). Because the device is always conducting, even if there is no input at all, power is drawn for the power supply. This is the chief reason for its inefficiency.</p>
       <center><a class="image" href="../../images/333/33341.png.htm"><img alt="Electronic Amplifier Class A.png" height="192" src="../../images/333/33341.png" width="311" /></a><br />
        <div class="references-small">Class A Amplifier</div>
       </center>
       <p>If high output powers are needed from a Class A circuit, the power waste (and the accompanying heat) will become significant. For every <!--del_lnk--> watt delivered to the <!--del_lnk--> load, the amplifier itself will, at best, dissipate another watt. For large powers. this means very large and expensive power supplies and heat sinking. Class A designs have largely been superseded for <a href="../../wp/s/Sound.htm" title="Sound">audio</a> power amplifiers, though some <!--del_lnk--> audiophiles believe that Class A gives the best sound quality, due to it being operated in as linear a manner as possible which provides a small market for expensive high fidelity Class A amps. In addition, some aficionados prefer <!--del_lnk--> thermionic valve (or "tube") designs instead of transistors, for several claimed reasons:</p>
       <p>Tubes are more commonly used in class A designs, which have an asymmetrical <!--del_lnk--> transfer function. This means that distortion of a <!--del_lnk--> sine wave creates both odd- and even-numbered <!--del_lnk--> harmonics. The claim is that this sounds more "musical" than the higher level of odd harmonics produced by a symmetrical push&ndash;pull amplifier. Though good amplifier design can reduce harmonic distortion patterns to almost nothing, distortion is essential to the sound of <!--del_lnk--> electric guitar amplifiers, for example, and is held by recording engineers to offer more flattering microphones and to enhance "clinical-sounding" digital technology.</p>
       <p>Valves use many more <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electrons</a> at once than a transistor, and so statistical effects lead to a "smoother" approximation of the true waveform &mdash; see <!--del_lnk--> shot noise for more on this. Junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) have similar characteristics to valves, so these are found more often in high quality amplifiers than bipolar transistors. Historically, valve amplifiers often used a Class A power amplifier simply because valves are large and expensive; many Class A designs use only a single device.</p>
       <p>Transistors are much cheaper, and so more elaborate designs that give greater efficiency but use more parts are still cost-effective. A classic application for a pair of class A devices is the <!--del_lnk--> long-tailed pair, which is exceptionally linear, and forms the basis of many more complex circuits, including many audio amplifiers and almost all <!--del_lnk--> op-amps. Class A amplifiers are often used in output stages of <!--del_lnk--> op-amps; they are sometimes used as medium-power, low-efficiency, and high-cost audio amplifiers. The power consumption is unrelated to the output power. At idle (no input), the power consumption is essentially the same as at high output volume. The result is low efficiency and high heat dissipation.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Class_B_and_AB">Class B and AB</span></h3>
       <p>Class B amplifiers only amplify half of the input wave cycle. As such they create a large amount of distortion, but their efficiency is greatly improved and is much better than Class A. <b>Class B has a maximum theoretical efficiency of 78.5% (i.e., &pi;/4).</b> This is because the amplifying element is switched off altogether half of the time, and so cannot dissipate power. A single Class B element is rarely found in practice, though it can be used in <!--del_lnk--> RF power amplifier where the distortion levels are less important. However Class C is more commonly used for this.</p>

        <div class="references-small">Class B Amplifier</div>
       </center>
       <p>A practical circuit using Class B elements is the complementary pair or "push&ndash;pull" arrangement. Here, complementary or quasi-complementary devices are used to each amplify the opposite halves of the input signal, which is then recombined at the output. This arrangement gives excellent efficiency, but can suffer from the drawback that there is a small mismatch at the "joins" between the two halves of the signal. This is called <!--del_lnk--> crossover distortion. An improvement is to bias the devices so they are not completely off when they're not in use. This approach is called Class AB operation.</p>
       <p>In Class AB operation, each device operates the same way as in Class B over half the waveform, but also conducts a small amount on the other half. As a result, the region where both devices simultaneously are nearly off (the "dead zone") is reduced. The result is that when the waveforms from the two devices are combined, the crossover is greatly minimised or eliminated altogether.</p>
       <p>Class AB sacrifices some efficiency over class B in favour of linearity, so will always be less efficient (below 78.5%). It is typically much more efficient than class A.</p>

       </center>
       <p>Class B or AB push&ndash;pull circuits are the most common design type found in audio power amplifiers. Class AB is widely considered a good compromise for audio amplifiers, since much of the time the music is quiet enough that the signal stays in the "class A" region, where it is amplified with good fidelity, and by definition if passing out of this region, is large enough that the distortion products typical of class B are relatively small. The crossover distortion can be reduced further by using negative feedback. Class B and AB amplifiers are sometimes used for RF linear amplifiers as well. Class B amplifiers are also favored in battery-operated devices, such as <!--del_lnk--> transistor radios.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Class_C">Class C</span></h3>
       <p>Class C amplifiers conduct less than 50% of the input signal and the distortion at the output is high, but high efficiencies (up to 90%) are possible. Some applications (for example, <!--del_lnk--> megaphones) can tolerate the distortion. A much more common application for Class C amplifiers is in RF <!--del_lnk--> transmitters, where the distortion can be vastly reduced by using tuned loads on the amplifier stage. The input signal is used to roughly switch the amplifying device on and off, which causes pulses of current to flow through a <!--del_lnk--> tuned circuit.</p>
       <p>The Class C amp has 2 modes of operation: tuned, and untuned. The diagram below shows a waveform from a simple class C circuit without the tuned load. This is called untuned operation, and the analysis of the waveforms shows the massive distortion that appears in the signal. When the proper load (e.g., a pure LC filter) is used, 2 things happen. The first is that the output's bias level is "clamped", so that the output variation is centered at one-half of the supply voltage. This is why tuned operation is sometimes called a "clamper". This action of elevating bias level allows the waveform to be restored to its proper shape, allowing a complete waveform to be re-established despite having only a one-polarity supply. This is directly related to the second phenomenon: the waveform on the center frequency becomes much less distorted. The distortion that is present is dependent upon the bandwidth of the tuned load, with the centre frequency seeing very little distortion, but greater attenuation the farther from the tuned frequency that the signal gets.</p>
       <p>The tuned circuit will only resonate at particular frequencies, and so the unwanted frequencies are dramatically suppressed, and the wanted full signal (sine wave) will be extracted by the tuned load (<!--del_lnk--> e.g., a high-quality bell will ring at a particular frequency when it is hit periodically with a hammer). Provided the transmitter is not required to operate over a very wide band of frequencies, this arrangement works extremely well. Other residual harmonics can be removed using a filter.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Class_D">Class D</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Class D amplifiers are much more efficient than Class AB power amplifiers. As such, Class D amplifiers do not need large transformers and heavy heatsinks, which means that they are smaller and lighter in weight than an equivalent Class AB amplifier. All power devices in a Class D amplifier are operated in on/off mode. Output stages such as those used in <!--del_lnk--> pulse generators are examples of class D amplifiers. The term usually applies to devices intended to reproduce signals with a bandwidth well below the switching frequency.</p>
       <p>These amplifiers use <!--del_lnk--> pulse width modulation, <!--del_lnk--> pulse density modulation (sometimes referred to as pulse frequency modulation) or more advanced form of modulation such as <!--del_lnk--> Delta-sigma modulation (for example, in the Analog Devices AD1990 Class-D audio power amplifier).</p>
       <p>The input signal is converted to a sequence of pulses whose averaged value is directly proportional to the instantaneous amplitude of the signal. The frequency of the pulses is typically ten or more times the highest frequency of interest in the input signal. The output of such an amplifier contains unwanted spectral components (that is, the pulse frequency and its <!--del_lnk--> harmonics) which must be removed by a passive <!--del_lnk--> filter. The resulting filtered signal is then an amplified replica of the input.</p>
       <p>The main advantage of a class D amplifier is power efficiency. Because the output pulses have a fixed amplitude, the switching elements (usually <!--del_lnk--> MOSFETs, but valves and <!--del_lnk--> bipolar transistors were once used) are switched either on or off, rather than operated in linear mode. This means that very little power is dissipated by the transistors, except during the very short interval between the on and off states. The wasted power is low because the instantaneous power dissipated in the transistor is the product of voltage and current, and one or the other is almost always close to zero. The lower losses permit the use of a smaller <!--del_lnk--> heat sink while the <!--del_lnk--> power supply requirements are lessened too.</p>
       <p>Class D amplifiers can be controlled by either <!--del_lnk--> analog or <!--del_lnk--> digital circuits. The digital control introduces additional distortion called <i>quantization error</i> caused by its conversion of the input signal to a digital value.</p>
       <p>Class D amplifiers have been widely used to control <!--del_lnk--> motors, and almost exclusively for small DC motors, but they are now also used as audio amplifiers, with some extra circuitry to allow analogue to be converted to a much higher frequency pulse width modulated signal. The relative difficulty of achieving good audio quality means that nearly all are used in applications where quality is not a factor, such as modestly-priced bookshelf audio systems and "DVD-receivers" in mid-price home theatre systems.</p>
       <p>High quality Class D audio amplifiers are now, however, starting to appear in the market:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Tripath have called their revised Class D designs Class T.</li>
        <li>Bang and Olufsen's ICEPower Class D system has been used in the Alpine PDX range and some Pioneer's PRS range and for other manufacturers' equipment.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>These revised designs have been said to rival good traditional AB amplifiers in terms of quality.</p>
       <p>Before these higher quality designs existed an earlier use of Class D amplifiers and prolific area of application was high-powered, subwoofer amplifiers in cars. Because subwoofers are generally limited to a bandwidth of no higher than 150&nbsp;Hz, the switching speed for the amplifier does not have to be as high as for a full range amplifier. The drawback with Class D designs being used to power subwoofers is that their output filters (typically inductors that convert the pulse width signal back into an analogue waveform) lower the <!--del_lnk--> damping factor of the amplifier.</p>
       <p>This means that the amplifier cannot prevent the subwoofer's reactive nature from lessening the impact of low bass sounds (as explained in the feedback part of the Class AB section). Class D amplifiers for driving subwoofers are relatively inexpensive, in comparison to Class AB amplifiers. A 1000 watt Class D subwoofer amplifier that can operate at about 80% to 95% efficiency costs about $250 USD, much less than a Class AB amplifier of this power, which would cost several thousand dollars.</p>
       <p>The letter <i>D</i> used to designate this amplifier class is simply the next letter after <i>C</i>, and does not stand for <i><!--del_lnk--> digital</i>. Class D and Class E amplifiers are sometimes mistakenly described as "digital" because the output waveform superficially resembles a pulse-train of digital symbols, but a Class D amplifier merely converts an input waveform into a continuously <!--del_lnk--> pulse-width modulated (square wave) analog signal. (A digital waveform would be <!--del_lnk--> pulse-code modulated.)</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialty_classes">Specialty classes</span></h3>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Class_E">Class E</span></h4>
       <p>The class E/F amplifier is a highly efficient switching power amplifier, typically used at such high frequencies that the switching time becomes comparable to the duty time. As said in the class-D amplifier the transistor is connected via a serial-LC-circuit to the load, and connected via a large L (inductance) to the supply voltage. The supply voltage is connected to ground via a large capacitor to prevent any RF-signals leaking into the supply. The class-E amplifier adds a <i>C</i> between the transistor and ground and uses a defined <i>L<sub>1</sub></i> to connect to the supply voltage.</p>
       <center><a class="image" href="../../images/333/33354.png.htm"><img alt="Classe E.svg" height="215" src="../../images/333/33354.png"  width="342" /></a><br />
        <div class="references-small">Class E Amplifier</div>
       </center>
       <p>The following description ignores DC, which can be added afterwards easily. The above mentioned <i>C</i> (<i>C1</i> in the figure) and L are in effect a parallel LC-circuit to ground. When the transistor is on, it pushes through the serial LC-circuit into the load and some current begins to flow to the parallel LC-circuit to ground. Then the serial LC-circuit swings back and compensates the current into the parallel LC-circuit. At this point the current through the transistor is zero and it is switched off. Both LC-circuits are now filled with energy in the C and the L<sub>0</sub>. The whole circuit performs a damped oscillation. The damping by the load has been adjusted so that some time later the energy from the Ls is gone into the load, but the energy in both C<sub>0</sub> peaks at the original value, to in turn restore the original voltage, so that the voltage across the transistor is zero again and it can be switched on.</p>
       <p>With load, frequency, and duty cycle (0.5) as given parameters and the constraint that the voltage is not only restored, but peaks at the original voltage, the four parameters (L,L<sub>0</sub>,C,C<sub>0</sub>) are determined. The class F-amplifier takes the finite on resistance into account and tries to make the current touch the bottom at zero. This means the voltage and the current at the transistor are symmetric with respect to time. The <!--del_lnk--> Fourier Transform allows an elegant formulation to generate the complicated LC-networks. It says that the first harmonic is passed into the load, all even harmonics are shorted and all higher odd harmonics are open.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Class_F_and_the_even_harmonics">Class F and the even harmonics</span></h4>
       <p>In push&ndash;pull amplifiers and in CMOS the even harmonics of both transistors just cancel. Experiment tells that a square wave can be generated by those amplifiers and math tells that square waves do consist of odd harmonics only. In a class D amplifier the output filter blocks all harmonics, that means the harmonics see an open load. So even small currents in the harmonics suffice to generate a voltage square wave. The current is in phase with the voltage applied to filter, but the voltage across the transistors is out of phase. Therefore there is a minimal overlap between current through the transistors and voltage across the transistors. The sharper the edges the lower the overlap.</p>
       <p>While class D sees the transistors and the load as two separate modules the class F admits imperfections like the parasitics of the transistor and tries to optimise the global system to have a high impedance at the harmonics. Of course there has to be a finite voltage across the transistor to push the current across the on state resistance. Because the combined current through both transistors is mostly in the first harmonic it looks like a sine. That means that in the middle of the square the maximum of current has to flow, so it may make sense to have a dip in the square or in other words to allow some over swing of the voltage square wave. A class F load network by definition has to transmit below a cut off frequency and to reflect above.</p>
       <p>Any frequency lying below the cut off and having its second harmonic above the cut off can be amplified, that is an octave bandwidth. On the other hand an LC series circuit with a large L and a tunable C may be simpler to implement. By reducing the duty cycle below 0.5, the output amplitude can be modulated. The voltage square waveform will degrade, but any overheating is compensated by the lower overall power flowing. Any load mismatch behind the filter can only act on the first harmonic current waveform, clearly only a purely resistive load makes sense, then the lower the resistance the higher the current.</p>
       <p>Class F can be driven by sine or by a square wave, for a sine the input can be tuned by an L to increase gain. If class F is implemented with a single transistor the filter is complicated to short the even harmonics. All previous designs use sharp edges to minimise the overlap. Class E uses a significant amount of second harmonic voltage. The second harmonic can be used to reduce the overlap with edges with finite sharpness. For this to work energy on the second harmonic has to flow from the load into the transistor, and no source for this is visible in the circuit diagram. In reality the impedance is mostly reactive and the only reason for it is that class E is a class F amplifier with a very simplified load network and thus has to deal with imperfections.</p>
       <p>In many amateur simulations of class E amplifiers sharp current edges are assumed nullifying the very motivation for class E and measurements near the transit frequency of the transistors show very symmetric curves, which look much similar to class F simulations. The class E amplifier was invented in 1972 by Nathan O. Sokal and <!--del_lnk--> Alan D. Sokal, and details were first published in 1975. Some earlier reports on this operating class have been published in Russian.</p>

       <p>There are a variety of amplifier designs that couple a class AB output stage with other more efficient techniques to achieve a higher efficiency with low distortion. These designs are common in large audio amplifiers, for instance, since the heatsinks and power transformers would be prohibitively large (and costly) without the increase in efficiency. The terms "class G" and "class H" are used interchangeably to refer to different designs, varying in definition from one manufacturer or paper to another.</p>
       <p>Class G amplifiers are a more efficient version of class AB amplifiers, which use "rail switching" to decrease power consumption and increase efficiency. The amplifier has several power rails at different voltages, and switches between rails as the signal output approaches each. Thus the amp increases efficiency by reducing the wasted power at the output transistors.</p>
       <p><a class="image" href="../../images/333/33367.gif.htm"><img alt="ClassG.GIF" height="250" src="../../images/333/33367.gif" width="400" /></a></p>
       <p>A Class H amplifier takes the idea of Class G one step further creating an infinite number of supply rails. This is done by modulating the supply rails so that the rails are only a few volts larger than the output signal at any given time. The output stage operates at its maximum efficiency all the time. Switched mode power supplies can be used to create the tracking rails. Significant efficiency gains can be achieved but with the drawback of more complicated supply design and reduced THD performance.</p>
       <p><a class="image" href="../../images/333/33371.gif.htm"><img alt="ClassH.GIF" height="250" src="../../images/333/33371.gif" width="400" /></a></p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Efficiency Class H The classes can be most easily understood using the diagrams in each section below. For the sake of illustration, a <!--del_lnk--> bipolar junction transistor is shown as the amplifying device, but in practice this could be a <!--del_lnk--> MOSFET or vacuum tube device. In an analog amplifier (the most common kind), the signal is applied to the input terminal of the device (base, gate or grid), and this causes a proportional output drive <!--del_lnk--> current to flow out of the output terminal. The output drive current comes from the power supply.</p>
       <p>The voltage signal shown is thus a larger version of the input, but has been changed in sign (inverted) by the amplification. Other arrangements of amplifying device are possible, but that given (that is, <!--del_lnk--> common emitter, <!--del_lnk--> common source or <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Amplifier.htm" title="Common cathode">common cathode</a>) is the easiest to understand and employ in practice. If the amplifying element is linear, then the output will be faithful copy of the input, only larger and inverted. In actual practice, transistors are not linear, and the output will only approximate the input. <!--del_lnk--> Non-linearity from any of several sources is the origin of distortion within an amplifier. Which class of amplifier (A, B, AB or C) depends on how the amplifying device is <!--del_lnk--> biased &mdash; in the diagrams the bias circuits are omitted for clarity.</p>
       <p>Any real amplifier is an imperfect realisation of an ideal amplifier. One important limitation of a real amplifier is that the output it can generate is ultimately limited by the power available from the power supply. An amplifier will saturate and clip the output if the input signal becomes too large for the amplifier to reproduce or if operational limits for a device are exceeded.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Doherty_amplifiers">Doherty amplifiers</span></h4>
       <p>A hybrid configuration receiving new attention is the Doherty amplifier, invented in 1934 by <!--del_lnk--> William H. Doherty for <!--del_lnk--> Bell Laboratories (whose sister company, <!--del_lnk--> Western Electric, was then an important manufacturer of radio transmitters). The Doherty amplifier consists of a class-B main (or "carrier") stage in parallel with a class-C auxiliary (or "peaking") stage. The input signal is split evenly to drive the two amplifiers, and a combining network sums the two output signals and corrects for phase differences between the two amplifiers. During periods of low signal level, the class-B amplifier efficiently operates on the signal and the class-C amplifier is inactive and consumes no power. During high signal peaks the class-B amplifier saturates and the class-C amplifier kicks in. The efficiency of previous AM transmitter designs was proportional to modulation, but with average modulation typically 20 percent, transmitters were limited to less than 50 percent efficiency. In Doherty's design, even with zero modulation a transmitter could achieve at least 60 percent efficiency.</p>
       <p>The Doherty amplifier remains in use in very-high-power AM transmitters, but for lower-power AM transmitters, vacuum-tube amplifiers in general were eclipsed in the 1980s by arrays of solid-state amplifiers, which could be switched on and off with much finer granularity in response to the requirements of the input audio. However, interest in the Doherty configuration has been revived by cellular-telephone and wireless-Internet applications where the sum of several constant-envelope users creates an aggregate AM result. The main challenge of the Doherty amplifier for digital transmission modes is in aligning the two stages and getting the class-C amplifier to turn on and off very quickly.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_classes">Other classes</span></h4>
       <p>Several audio amplifier manufacturers have started "inventing" new classes as a way to differentiate themselves. These class names usually do not reflect any revolutionary amplification technique, and are used mostly for marketing purposes. This can easily be determined by the fact that the class name is trademarked or copyrighted. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Crown's K and I-Tech Series as well as several other models utilise Crown's patented Class-I (or BCA) technology. <!--del_lnk--> Lab.gruppen use a form of class D amplifier called class TD or Tracked Class D which tracks the waveform to more accurately amplify it without the drawbacks of traditional class D amplifiers.</p>
       <p>"<!--del_lnk--> Class T" is a trademark of TriPath company, which manufactures audio amplifier ICs. This new class "T" is a revision of the common class D amplifier, but with changes to ensure fidelity over the full audio spectrum, unlike traditional class D designs. It operates at different frequencies depending on the power output, with values ranging from as low as 200 kHz to 1.2 MHz, using a proprietary modulator.</p>
       <p>"Class Z" is a trademark of <!--del_lnk--> Zetex semiconductor and is a direct-digital-feedback technology.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Amplifier_circuit">Amplifier circuit</span></h3>
       <p>For the purposes of illustration, this practical amplifier circuit is described. It could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier. It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class AB <!--del_lnk--> push&ndash;pull output stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realisable with FETs or valves.</p>

       <p>The input signal is coupled through <!--del_lnk--> capacitor C1 to the base of transistor Q1. The capacitor allows the <a href="../../wp/a/Alternating_current.htm" title="Alternating current">AC</a> signal to pass, but blocks the <!--del_lnk--> DC bias voltage established by <!--del_lnk--> resistors R1 and R2 so that any preceding circuit is not affected by it. Q1 and Q2 form a <!--del_lnk--> differential amplifier (an amplifier that multiplies the difference between two inputs by some constant), in an arrangement known as a <!--del_lnk--> long-tailed pair. This arrangement is used to conveniently allow the use of negative feedback, which is fed from the output to Q2 via R7 and R8.</p>
       <p>The negative feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier to compare the input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a <!--del_lnk--> common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (A better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in Class A. The output pair are arranged in Class AB push&ndash;pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide the majority of the current amplification and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The <!--del_lnk--> diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).</p>
       <p>This design is simple, but a good basis for a practical design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably be found in a real design that would roll off the <!--del_lnk--> frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted <!--del_lnk--> oscillation. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors &mdash; if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.</p>
       <p>A common solution to help stabilise the output devices is to include some emitter resistors, typically an ohm or so. Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amp.</p>
