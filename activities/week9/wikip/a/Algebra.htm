       <p>Algebra is much broader than elementary algebra and can be generalized. In addition to working directly with numbers, algebra covers working with <!--del_lnk--> symbols, variables, and <!--del_lnk--> set <!--del_lnk--> elements. Addition and multiplication are viewed as general <!--del_lnk--> operations, and their precise definitions lead to structures such as <a href="../../wp/g/Group_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Group (mathematics)">groups</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rings and <!--del_lnk--> fields.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification">Classification</span></h2>
       <p>Algebra may be divided roughly into the following categories:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b><a href="../../wp/e/Elementary_algebra.htm" title="Elementary algebra">Elementary algebra</a></b>, in which the properties of operations on the <a href="../../wp/r/Real_number.htm" title="Real number">real number system</a> are recorded using symbols as "place holders" to denote <!--del_lnk--> constants and <!--del_lnk--> variables, and the rules governing <!--del_lnk--> mathematical expressions and <a href="../../wp/e/Equation.htm" title="Equation">equations</a> involving these symbols are studied (note that this usually includes the subject matter of courses called <i>intermediate algebra</i> and <i>college algebra</i>), also called second year and third year algebra;</li>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Elementary_algebra">Elementary algebra</span></h2>
       <p><b>Elementary algebra</b> is the most basic form of algebra. It is taught to students who are presumed to have no knowledge of <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> beyond the basic principles of <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a>. In arithmetic, only <a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">numbers</a> and their arithmetical operations (such as +, &minus;, &times;, &divide;) occur. In algebra, numbers are often denoted by symbols (such as <i>a</i>, <i>x</i>, or <i>y</i>). This is useful because:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>It allows the general formulation of arithmetical laws (such as <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = <i>b</i> + <i>a</i> for all <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), and thus is the first step to a systematic exploration of the properties of the <a href="../../wp/r/Real_number.htm" title="Real number">real number system</a>.</li>
        <li>It allows the reference to "unknown" numbers, the formulation of <a href="../../wp/e/Equation.htm" title="Equation">equations</a> and the study of how to solve these (for instance, "Find a number <i>x</i> such that 3<i>x</i> + 1 = 10").</li>
        <li>It allows the formulation of <a href="../../wp/f/Function_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Function (mathematics)">functional</a> relationships (such as "If you sell <i>x</i> tickets, then your profit will be 3<i>x</i> - 10 dollars, or <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = 3<i>x</i> - 10, where <i>f</i> is the function, and <i>x</i> is the number to which the function is applied.").</li>
       </ul>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Polynomials">Polynomials</span></h3>
       <p>A <b>polynomial</b> is an <!--del_lnk--> expression that is constructed from one or more <!--del_lnk--> variables and constants, using only the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication (where repeated multiplication of the same variable is standardly denoted as exponentiation with a constant positive whole number exponent). For example, <img alt="x^2 + 2x -3\," class="tex" src="../../images/106/10647.png" /> is a polynomial in the single variable <i>x</i>.</p>
       <p>An important class of problems in algebra is <a href="../../wp/f/Factorization.htm" title="Factorization">factorization</a> of polynomials, that is, expressing a given polynomial as a product of other polynomials. The example polynomial above can be factored as <img alt="(x-1)(x+3)\,\!." class="tex" src="../../images/106/10648.png" /> A related class of problems is finding algebraic expressions for the <!--del_lnk--> roots of a polynomial in a single variable.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Abstract_algebra">Abstract algebra</span></h2>
       <p><b>Abstract algebra</b> extends the familiar concepts found in elementary algebra and <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a> of <a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">numbers</a> to more general concepts.</p>
       <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Sets</b>: Rather than just considering the different types of <a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">numbers</a>, abstract algebra deals with the more general concept of <i>sets</i>: a collection of all objects (called <!--del_lnk--> elements) selected by property, specific for the set. All collections of the familiar types of numbers are sets. Other examples of sets include the set of all two-by-two <a href="../../wp/m/Matrix_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Matrix (mathematics)">matrices</a>, the set of all second-degree <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Polynomial.htm" title="Polynomials">polynomials</a> (<i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i>), the set of all two dimensional <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Euclidean_vector.htm" title="Vector (spatial)">vectors</a> in the plane, and the various <!--del_lnk--> finite groups such as the <a href="../../wp/c/Cyclic_group.htm" title="Cyclic group">cyclic groups</a> which are the group of integers <a href="../../wp/m/Modular_arithmetic.htm" title="Modular arithmetic">modulo</a> <i>n</i>. <a href="../../wp/s/Set_theory.htm" title="Set theory">Set theory</a> is a branch of <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a> and not technically a branch of algebra.</p>
       <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Binary operations</b>: The notion of <a href="../../wp/a/Addition.htm" title="Addition">addition</a> (+) is abstracted to give a <i>binary operation</i>, * say. The notion of binary operation is meaningless without the set on which the operation is defined. For two elements <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in a set <i>S</i> <i>a</i>*<i>b</i> gives another element in the set; this condition is called <!--del_lnk--> closure. <a href="../../wp/a/Addition.htm" title="Addition">Addition</a> (+), <a href="../../wp/s/Subtraction.htm" title="Subtraction">subtraction</a> (-), <a href="../../wp/m/Multiplication.htm" title="Multiplication">multiplication</a> (&times;), and <a href="../../wp/d/Division_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Division (mathematics)">division</a> (&divide;) can be binary operations when defined on different sets, as is addition and multiplication of matrices, vectors, and polynomials.</p>
       <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Identity elements</b>: The numbers zero and one are abstracted to give the notion of an <i>identity element</i> for an operation. Zero is the identity element for addition and one is the identity element for multiplication. For a general binary operator * the identity element <i>e</i> must satisfy <i>a</i> * <i>e</i> = <i>a</i> and <i>e</i> * <i>a</i> = <i>a</i>. This holds for addition as <i>a</i> + 0 = <i>a</i> and 0 + <i>a</i> = <i>a</i> and multiplication <i>a</i> &times; 1 = <i>a</i> and 1 &times; <i>a</i> = <i>a</i>. However, if we take the positive natural numbers and addition, there is no identity element.</p>
       <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Inverse elements</b>: The negative numbers give rise to the concept of <i>inverse elements</i>. For addition, the inverse of <i>a</i> is <i>-a</i>, and for multiplication the inverse is 1/<i>a</i>. A general inverse element <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> must satisfy the property that <i>a</i> * <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> = <i>e</i> and <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> * <i>a</i> = <i>e</i>.</p>
       <p><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Associative_property.htm" title="Associativity">Associativity</a></b>: Addition of integers has a property called associativity. That is, the grouping of the numbers to be added does not affect the sum. For example: (2+3)+4=2+(3+4). In general, this becomes (<i>a</i> * <i>b</i>) * <i>c</i> = <i>a</i> * (<i>b</i> * <i>c</i>). This property is shared by most binary operations, but not subtraction or division or <!--del_lnk--> octonion multiplication.</p>
       <p><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Commutative_property.htm" title="Commutative operation">Commutativity</a></b>: Addition of integers also has a property called commutativity. That is, the order of the numbers to be added does not affect the sum. For example: 2+3=3+2. In general, this becomes <i>a</i> * <i>b</i> = <i>b</i> * <i>a</i>. Only some binary operations have this property. It holds for the integers with addition and multiplication, but it does not hold for <a href="../../wp/m/Matrix_multiplication.htm" title="Matrix multiplication">matrix multiplication</a> or <!--del_lnk--> quaternion multiplication .</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Groups.E2.80.94structures_of_a_set_with_a_single_binary_operation">Groups&mdash;structures of a set with a single binary operation</span></h3>
       <p>Combining the above concepts gives one of the most important structures in mathematics: a <b><a href="../../wp/g/Group_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Group (mathematics)">group</a></b>. A group is a combination of a set <i>S</i> and a single <!--del_lnk--> binary operation '*', defined in any way you choose, but with the following properties:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>An identity element <i>e</i> exists, such that for every member <i>a</i> of <i>S</i>, <i>e</i> * <i>a</i> and <i>a</i> * <i>e</i> are both identical to <i>a</i>.</li>
        <li>Every element has an inverse: for every member <i>a</i> of <i>S</i>, there exists a member <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> such that <i>a</i> * <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> and <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> * <i>a</i> are both identical to the identity element.</li>
        <li>The operation is associative: if <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are members of <i>S</i>, then (<i>a</i> * <i>b</i>) * <i>c</i> is identical to <i>a</i> * (<i>b</i> * <i>c</i>).</li>
       </ul>
       <p>If a group is also <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Commutative_property.htm" title="Commutativity">commutative</a> - that is, for any two members <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of <i>S</i>, <i>a</i> * <i>b</i> is identical to <i>b</i> * <i>a</i> &ndash; then the group is said to be <!--del_lnk--> Abelian.</p>
       <p>For example, the set of integers under the operation of addition is a group. In this group, the identity element is 0 and the inverse of any element <i>a</i> is its negation, -<i>a</i>. The associativity requirement is met, because for any integers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) + <i>c</i> = <i>a</i> + (<i>b</i> + <i>c</i>)</p>
       <p>The nonzero <a href="../../wp/r/Rational_number.htm" title="Rational number">rational numbers</a> form a group under multiplication. Here, the identity element is 1, since 1 &times; <i>a</i> = <i>a</i> &times; 1 = <i>a</i> for any rational number <i>a</i>. The inverse of <i>a</i> is 1/<i>a</i>, since <i>a</i> &times; 1/<i>a</i> = 1.</p>
       <p>The integers under the multiplication operation, however, do not form a group. This is because, in general, the multiplicative inverse of an integer is not an integer. For example, 4 is an integer, but its multiplicative inverse is 1/4, which is not an integer.</p>
       <p>The theory of groups is studied in <a href="../../wp/g/Group_theory.htm" title="Group theory">group theory</a>. A major result in this theory is the <!--del_lnk--> classification of finite simple groups, mostly published between about 1955 and 1983, which is thought to classify all of the <!--del_lnk--> finite <!--del_lnk--> simple groups into roughly 30 basic types.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Semigroups, <!--del_lnk--> quasigroups, and <!--del_lnk--> monoids are structures similar to groups, but more general. They comprise a set and a closed binary operation, but do not necessarily satisfy the other conditions. A <!--del_lnk--> semigroup has an <i>associative</i> binary operation, but might not have an identity element. A <!--del_lnk--> monoid is a semigroup which does have an identity but might not have an inverse for every element. A <!--del_lnk--> quasigroup satisfies a requirement that any element can be turned into any other by a unique pre- or post-operation; however the binary operation might not be associative. All are instance of <!--del_lnk--> groupoids, structures with a binary operation upon which no further conditions are imposed.</p>
       <p>All groups are monoids, and all monoids are semigroups.</p>

       <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Distributivity</b> generalised the <i>distributive law</i> for numbers, and specifies the order in which the operators should be applied, (called the <!--del_lnk--> precedence). For the integers (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) &times; c = <i>a</i>&times;<i>c</i>+ <i>b</i>&times;<i>c</i> and <i>c</i> &times; (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) = <i>c</i>&times;<i>a</i> + <i>c</i>&times;<i>b</i>, and &times; is said to be <i>distributive</i> over +.</p>
       <p>A <b><!--del_lnk--> ring</b> has two binary operations (+) and (&times;), with &times; distributive over +. Under the first operator (+) it forms an <i>Abelian group</i>. Under the second operator (&times;) it is associative, but it does not need to have identity, or inverse, so division is not allowed. The additive (+) identity element is written as 0 and the additive inverse of <i>a</i> is written as &minus;<i>a</i>.</p>
       <p>The integers are an example of a ring. The integers have additional properties which make it an <b><!--del_lnk--> integral domain</b>.</p>
       <p>A <b><!--del_lnk--> field</b> is a <i>ring</i> with the additional property that all the elements excluding 0 form an <i>Abelian group</i> under &times;. The multiplicative (&times;) identity is written as 1 and the multiplicative inverse of <i>a</i> is written as <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup>.</p>
       <p>The rational numbers, the real numbers and the complex numbers are all examples of fields.</p>

       <p>The origins of algebra can be traced to the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Babylonians, who developed an advanced <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetical system</a> with which they were able to do calculations in an algebraic fashion. With the use of this system they were able to apply formulas and calculate solutions for unknown values for a class of problems typically solved today by using <a href="../../wp/l/Linear_equation.htm" title="Linear equation">linear equations</a>, <a href="../../wp/q/Quadratic_equation.htm" title="Quadratic equation">quadratic equations</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> indeterminate linear equations. By contrast, most <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians of this era, and most <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_mathematics.htm" title="Indian mathematics">Indian</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Greek and <!--del_lnk--> Chinese mathematicians in the <!--del_lnk--> first millennium BC, usually solved such equations by <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometric</a> methods, such as those described in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Rhind Mathematical Papyrus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Sulba Sutras</i>, <a href="../../wp/e/Euclid%2527s_Elements.htm" title="Euclid's Elements">Euclid's <i>Elements</i></a>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</i>. The geometric work of the Greeks, typified in the <i>Elements</i>, provided the framework for generalizing formulae beyond the solution of particular problems into more general systems of stating and solving equations.</p>
       <p>Later, the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_mathematics.htm" title="Indian mathematics">Indian mathematicians</a> developed algebraic methods to a high degree of sophistication. Although Diophantus and the Babylonians used mostly special ad hoc methods to solve equations, <!--del_lnk--> Brahmagupta was the first to solve equations using general methods. He solved the linear indeterminate equations, quadratic equations, second order indeterminate equations and equations with multiple variable.</p>
       <p>The word "algebra" is named after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> word "<i>al-jabr</i>" from the title of the book <i><span class="Unicode"><!--del_lnk--> al-Kit&#x101;b al-mu&#x1E2B;ta&#x1E63;ar f&#x12B; &#x1E25;is&#x101;b al-&#x11F;abr wa-l-muq&#x101;bala</span></i>, meaning <i>The book of Summary Concerning Calculating by Transposition and Reduction</i>, a book written by the <!--del_lnk--> Persian mathematician <span class="Unicode"><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mu%25E1%25B8%25A5ammad_ibn_M%25C5%25ABs%25C4%2581_al-Khw%25C4%2581rizm%25C4%25AB.htm" title="Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi">Muhammad ibn M&#x16B;s&#x101; al-khw&#x101;rizm&#x12B;</a></span> in 820. The word <i>Al-Jabr</i> means <i>"reunion"</i>. The Hellenistic mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Diophantus has traditionally been known as "the father of algebra" but debate now exists as to whether or not Al-Khwarizmi should take that title. Those who support Al-Khwarizmi point to the fact that much of his work on <!--del_lnk--> reduction is still in use today and that he gave an exhaustive explanation of solving quadratic equations. Those who support <!--del_lnk--> Diophantus point to the fact that the algebra found in <i>Al-Jabr</i> is more elementary than the algebra found in <i>Arithmetica</i> and that <i>Arithmetica</i> is syncopated while <i>Al-Jabr</i> is fully rhetorical. Another Persian mathematician, <!--del_lnk--> Omar Khayyam, developed <!--del_lnk--> algebraic geometry and found the general geometric solution of the <!--del_lnk--> cubic equation. The Indian mathematicians <!--del_lnk--> Mahavira and <!--del_lnk--> Bhaskara II, and the Chinese mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Zhu Shijie, solved various cases of cubic, <!--del_lnk--> quartic, <!--del_lnk--> quintic and higher-order <a href="../../wp/p/Polynomial.htm" title="Polynomial">polynomial</a> equations.</p>
       <p>Another key event in the further development of algebra was the general algebraic solution of the cubic and quartic equations, developed in the mid-16th century. The idea of a <a href="../../wp/d/Determinant.htm" title="Determinant">determinant</a> was developed by <!--del_lnk--> Japanese mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Kowa Seki in the 17th century, followed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> ten years later, for the purpose of solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using <a href="../../wp/m/Matrix_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Matrix (mathematics)">matrices</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Cramer also did some work on matrices and determinants in the 18th century. <a href="../../wp/a/Abstract_algebra.htm" title="Abstract algebra">Abstract algebra</a> was developed in the 19th century, initially focusing on what is now called <a href="../../wp/g/Galois_theory.htm" title="Galois theory">Galois theory</a>, and on <!--del_lnk--> constructibility issues.</p>
       <p>The stages of the development of symbolic algebra are roughly as follows:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Rhetorical algebra, which was developed by the Babylonians and remained dominant up to the 16th century;</li>
        <li>Geometric constructive algebra, which was emphasised by the <!--del_lnk--> Vedic Indian and classical Greek mathematicians;</li>
        <li>Syncopated algebra, as developed by <!--del_lnk--> Diophantus, <!--del_lnk--> Brahmagupta and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bakhshali Manuscript</i>; and</li>
        <li>Symbolic algebra, which was initiated by <!--del_lnk--> Ab&#x16B; al-Hasan ibn Al&#x12B; al-Qalas&#x101;d&#x12B; and sees its culmination in the work of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a>.</li>
