He wrote on many subjects, including <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> metaphysics, <!--del_lnk--> poetry, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theater">theatre</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rhetoric, <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">politics</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a> and <!--del_lnk--> zoology.</p>
       <p>Together with <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Socrates.htm" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> (Plato's teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in <!--del_lnk--> Western philosophy. He was the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy, encompassing morality and aesthetics, logic and science, politics and metaphysics. Aristotle's views on the <!--del_lnk--> physical sciences profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, although they were ultimately replaced by <!--del_lnk--> modern physics. In the biological sciences, some of his observations were only confirmed to be accurate in the nineteenth century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a>, which were incorporated in the late nineteenth century into modern <!--del_lnk--> formal logic. In <!--del_lnk--> metaphysics, <!--del_lnk--> Aristotelianism had a profound influence on <!--del_lnk--> philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, and it continues to influence <!--del_lnk--> Christian theology, especially <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Orthodox theology, and the <!--del_lnk--> scholastic tradition of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.</p>
       <p>Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues (<!--del_lnk--> Cicero described his literary style as "a river of gold"), it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one third of the original works have survived.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Life">Life</span></h2>
       <p>Aristotle was born in <!--del_lnk--> Stageira, <!--del_lnk--> Chalcidice in 384 BC. His father, <!--del_lnk--> Nicomachus was the personal physician to <!--del_lnk--> King Amyntas of Macedon. Aristotle was trained and educated as a member of the <!--del_lnk--> aristocracy. At about the age of eighteen, he went to <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a> to continue his education at <!--del_lnk--> Plato's Academy. Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years, not leaving until after Plato's death in 347 BC. He then traveled with <!--del_lnk--> Xenocrates to the court of his friend <!--del_lnk--> Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with <!--del_lnk--> Theophrastus to the island of <!--del_lnk--> Lesbos, where together they researched the <a href="../../wp/b/Botany.htm" title="Botany">botany</a> and zoology of the island. Aristotle married Hermias's adoptive daughter (or niece) <!--del_lnk--> Pythias. She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by <!--del_lnk--> Philip of Macedon to become tutor to <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>.</p>
       <p>After spending several years tutoring the young Alexander, Aristotle returned to Athens. By 335 BC, he established his own school there, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Lyceum. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died, and Aristotle became involved with <!--del_lnk--> Herpyllis of <!--del_lnk--> Stageira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, <!--del_lnk--> Nicomachus. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Suda, he also had an <!--del_lnk--> eromenos, <!--del_lnk--> Palaephatus of Abydus.</p>
       <p>It is during this period in Athens when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. Aristotle wrote many dialogues, only fragments of which survived. The works that have survived are in <!--del_lnk--> treatise form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication, as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include <i><!--del_lnk--> Physics</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Metaphysics</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Nicomachean Ethics</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Politics</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> De Anima (On the Soul)</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Poetics</i>. These works, although connected in many fundamental ways, vary significantly in both style and substance.</p>
       <p>Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied <a href="../../wp/a/Anatomy.htm" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> embryology, <a href="../../wp/g/Geography.htm" title="Geography">geography</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Meteorology.htm" title="Meteorology">meteorology</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> and <!--del_lnk--> zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on <a href="../../wp/a/Aesthetics.htm" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a>, <!--del_lnk--> metaphysics, <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">politics</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rhetoric and <!--del_lnk--> theology. He also studied <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>, foreign customs, <a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a>. His combined works constitute a virtual <a href="../../wp/e/Encyclopedia.htm" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> of Greek knowledge. It has been suggested that Aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time. Upon Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens once again flared. <!--del_lnk--> Eurymedon the hierophant denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honour. Aristotle fled the city to his mother's family estate in Chalcis, explaining, "I will not allow the Athenians to <!--del_lnk--> sin twice against philosophy," a reference to Athens's prior trial and execution of <a href="../../wp/s/Socrates.htm" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>. However, he died in Euboea of natural causes within the year (in 322 BC). Aristotle left a <!--del_lnk--> will and named chief executor his student <!--del_lnk--> Antipater, in which he asked to be buried next to his wife. It has also been proposed that Aristotle's banishment and death resulted from the possibility that he was involved with the death of Alexander.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Logic">Logic</span></h2>
       <p>Aristotle's conception of logic was the dominant form of logic until 19th century advances in <!--del_lnk--> mathematical logic. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Kant">Kant</a> stated in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h3>
       <p>Aristotle "says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'". However, Plato reports that <!--del_lnk--> syntax was devised before him, by Prodikos of Keos, who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from <!--del_lnk--> dialectics; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like <i><!--del_lnk--> reductio ad absurdum</i> in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a <!--del_lnk--> deduction system, he could never actually construct one and relied instead on his <!--del_lnk--> dialectic. Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from <!--del_lnk--> premises, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the <!--del_lnk--> conclusion would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book <i><!--del_lnk--> Sophist</i>, where he introduced his division method.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Analytics_and_the_Organon">Analytics and the <i>Organon</i></span></h3>
       <p>What we today call <i>Aristotelian logic</i>, Aristotle himself would have labeled "analytics". The term "logic" he reserved to mean <i>dialectics</i>. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD:</p>
       <ol>
        <li><i>Categories</i></li>
        <li><i>On Interpretation</i></li>
        <li><i>Prior Analytics</i></li>
        <li><i>Posterior Analytics</i></li>
        <li><i>Topics</i></li>
        <li><i>On Sophistical Refutations</i></li>
       </ol>
       <p>The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics) and dialectics (in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations). There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the <i>Organon</i>, namely the fourth book of <i>Metaphysics.</i>.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the <!--del_lnk--> universal. Aristotle, however, found the universal in <!--del_lnk--> particular things, which he called the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their <!--del_lnk--> prototype or <!--del_lnk--> exemplar. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal <!--del_lnk--> Forms (or ideas) to a contemplation of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, "form" still refers to the unconditional basis of <!--del_lnk--> phenomena but is "instantiated" in a particular substance (see <i><a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm#Universals_and_particulars" title="Aristotle">Universals and particulars</a></i>, below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both <!--del_lnk--> inductive and <!--del_lnk--> deductive, while Plato's is essentially deductive from <i><!--del_lnk--> a priori</i> principles.</p>
       <p>In Aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and included fields that would be regarded today as <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a> and other <!--del_lnk--> natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of <i>philosophy</i> has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the <!--del_lnk--> scientific method. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.</p>
       <p>In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with <!--del_lnk--> reasoning, which he also would describe as "science". Note, however, that his use of the term <i>science</i> carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "<!--del_lnk--> scientific method". For Aristotle, "all science (<i>dianoia</i>) is either practical, poetical or theoretical" (<i>Metaphysics</i> 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> and metaphysics.</p>
       <p>If logic (or "analytics") is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">Logic</a>; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including <!--del_lnk--> Metaphysics, <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">Physics</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a>, (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.</p>
       <p>In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform <!--del_lnk--> original research in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.</p>
       <p>Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the sixteenth century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his <i><!--del_lnk--> History of Animals</i> he claimed that human males have more teeth than females. In a similar vein, <!--del_lnk--> John Philoponus, and later <a href="../../wp/g/Galileo_Galilei.htm" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</a>, showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that the more massive object falls faster than a less massive object is incorrect. On the other hand, Aristotle refuted <!--del_lnk--> Democritus's claim that the <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays," pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given "current astronomical demonstrations" that "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then...the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them."</p>
       <p>In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched <!--del_lnk--> reason. Today's <!--del_lnk--> scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.</p>
       <p>Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the <i>Metaphysics</i>, which was widely accepted up until the 1500s. From the 3rd century to the 1500s, the dominant view held that the Earth was the centre of the universe (<!--del_lnk--> geocentrism).</p>
       <p>Since he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch. However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.</p>

This reduces the explanation of causes to the parts (factors, elements, constituents, ingredients) forming the whole (system, structure, compound, complex, composite, or combination), a relationship known as the part-whole causation. Simply put it is the influence of the material substances on the event. So imagine two dominos, the first of which is lighter. The first is knocked over into the second but does not have nough power to knock it over, this is Material cause.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> formal cause tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put it is the influence of the form (essence) of the things ont he vent. So take the two dominos again except this time the second is shaped prevent it from falling *eg. triangular.* this is formal cause.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> efficient cause is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of "cause" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. More simply again that which immediatly sets the thing in motion. So take the two dominos this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing thesecond also to fall over. This is effectivly efficient cause.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> final cause is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation, or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, all that gives purpose to behaviour.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goa or purpose that brings about an event (not necessarily a mental goal). Taking our two dominos, it requires someone to intentionlly knock the dominos over as they cannot fall themselves.</p>
       <p>Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.</p>
       <p>All further investigations of causality will consist of imposing the favorite hierarchies on the order causes, such as final > efficient > material > formal (<a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Aquinas.htm" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>), or of restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality (deterministic or chance) or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena (the natural sciences describing how things happen instead of explaining the whys and wherefores).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chance_and_spontaneity">Chance and spontaneity</span></h3>
       <p>Spontaneity and chance are causes of effects. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things. It is "from what is spontaneous" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of "chance" it might be better to think of "coincidence": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.</p>
       <p>There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names "luck", that can only apply to human beings, since it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. "What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance".</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Metaphysics">Metaphysics</span></h2>
       <p>Aristotle defines metaphysics as "the knowledge of <!--del_lnk--> immaterial being," or of "being in the highest degree of abstraction." He refers to metaphysics as "first philosophy", as well as "the theologic science."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Substance.2C_potentiality_and_actuality">Substance, potentiality and actuality</span></h3>
       <p>Aristotle examines the concept of substance (<i><!--del_lnk--> ousia</i>) in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Metaphysics</i>, Book VII and he concludes that a particular <b>substance</b> is a combination of both <b>matter</b> and <b>form</b>. As he proceeds to the book VIII, he concludes that the matter of the substance is the <!--del_lnk--> substratum or the stuff of which it is composed, <i>e.g.</i> the matter of the house are the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the <i>potential</i> house. While the form of the substance, is the <i>actual</i> house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other <!--del_lnk--> differentia (see also <!--del_lnk--> predicables). The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.</p>
       <p>With regard to the change (<i>kinesis</i>) and its causes now, as he defines in his <!--del_lnk--> Physics and <!--del_lnk--> On Generation and Corruption 319b-320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from 1. growth and diminution, which is change in quantity 2. locomotion, which is change in space and 3. alteration, which is change in quality. The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of <!--del_lnk--> potentiality (<i>dynamis</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> actuality (<i>entelecheia</i>) in association with the matter and the form.</p>
       <p>Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (<i>dynamei</i>) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (<i>poiein</i>) or 'be acted upon' (<i>paschein</i>), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate - being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise - acting).</p>
       <p>Actuality is the fulfillment of the <b>end</b> of the potentiality. Because the <b>end</b> (<i>telos</i>) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that actuality is when the seed of the plant becomes a plant.</p>
       <p>" For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see."</p>
       <p>In conclusion, the <b>matter</b> of the house is its <b>potentiality</b> and the <b>form</b> is its <b>actuality</b>. The <!--del_lnk--> formal cause (<i>aitia</i>) then of that change from potential to actual house, is the <!--del_lnk--> reason (<i>logos</i>) of the house builder and the <!--del_lnk--> final cause is the end, namely the house itself. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.</p>
       <p>With this <!--del_lnk--> definition of the <!--del_lnk--> particular substance (i.e., <b>matter and form</b>), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, <i>e.g.</i>, what is that makes the man one? Since, according to <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Universals_and_particulars">Universals and particulars</span></h3>
       <p>Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.</p>
       <p>Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but "good" is still a proper universal form. <a href="../../wp/b/Bertrand_Russell.htm" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> is a contemporary philosopher that agreed with Plato on the existence of "uninstantiated universals".</p>
       <p>Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.</p>
       <p>One way for contemporary philosophers to justify this position is by asserting the <!--del_lnk--> eleatic principle.</p>
       <p>In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biology_and_medicine">Biology and medicine</span></h2>
       <p>In all Aristotelian science, but most especially on biology, one should bear in mind these points:</p>

        <dd>1. Things he saw with his own eyes have stood the test of time well; but his retailing of the reports of others contains much error and superstition.</dd>
        <dd>2. The closer his general conclusions and theories are to his observations, the better the science.</dd>
        <dd>3. He dissected animals, but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.</dd>

       <p>Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of <!--del_lnk--> Lesbos, and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> History of Animals</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Generation of Animals</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Parts of Animals</i>, contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on <!--del_lnk--> catfish, <!--del_lnk--> electric fish (<!--del_lnk--> Torpedo) and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on <!--del_lnk--> cephalopods, namely, <i><!--del_lnk--> Octopus</i>, <i>Sepia</i> (<!--del_lnk--> cuttlefish) and the paper nautilus (<i><!--del_lnk--> Argonauta argo</i>). His description of the <!--del_lnk--> hectocotyl arm was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the nineteenth century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selach&#x113; (<!--del_lnk--> selachians).</p>

       <p>Another good example of his methods comes from the <i>Generation of Animals</i> in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.</p>
       <p>He gave accurate descriptions of <!--del_lnk--> ruminants' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the <!--del_lnk--> ovoviviparous embryological development of the <!--del_lnk--> hound shark <!--del_lnk--> Mustelus laevis.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification_of_living_things">Classification of living things</span></h3>
       <p>Aristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the nineteenth century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he was not to know that complex invertebrates do make use of <!--del_lnk--> haemoglobin, but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled &ndash; cephalopods &ndash; and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Carl_Linnaeus.htm" title="Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>, who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).</p>
       <p>For <!--del_lnk--> Charles Singer, "Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a <i>scala naturae</i>" Aristotle's <i>History of Animals</i> classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical "<!--del_lnk--> Ladder of Life" (<i>scala naturae</i>), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.</p>
       <p>Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., <!--del_lnk--> formal causes, guided all natural processes. Such a <!--del_lnk--> teleological view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that "no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns," and "a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen," Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had a multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.</p>
       <p>In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the <i>scala naturae</i> or <!--del_lnk--> Great Chain of Being. His system had eleven grades, arranged according "to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality", expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Theory_of_biological_forms_and_souls">Theory of biological forms and souls</span></h3>
       <p>Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.</p>
       <p>He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.</p>
       <p>Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain. Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of <!--del_lnk--> Alcmaeon.</p>
       <p>His analysis of procreation is frequently criticized on the grounds that it presupposes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive, lumpen female element; it is on these grounds that Aristotle is considered by some feminist critics to have been a <!--del_lnk--> misogynist.</p>

       <p>Aristotle's successor at the <!--del_lnk--> Lyceum, <!--del_lnk--> Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany&mdash;the <i><!--del_lnk--> History of Plants</i>&mdash;which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as <i>carpos</i> for fruit, and <i>pericarpion</i> for seed vessel.</p>
       <p>Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the <!--del_lnk--> efficient cause. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Influence_on_Hellenistic_medicine">Influence on Hellenistic medicine</span></h3>
       <p>Following Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is not until the age of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexandria.htm" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> under the <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found.</p>
       <p>The first medical teacher at Alexandria <!--del_lnk--> Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the circulatory system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between <!--del_lnk--> skin and <!--del_lnk--> arteries, noting that the latter <!--del_lnk--> pulse while the former do not. Though a few modern <!--del_lnk--> atomists such as <!--del_lnk--> Lucretius challenged the <!--del_lnk--> teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, <!--del_lnk--> natural theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. <!--del_lnk--> Ernst Mayr claimed that there was "nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance." Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Practical_Philosophy">Practical Philosophy</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ethics">Ethics</span></h3>
       <p>Aristotle considered <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a> to be a practical science, i.e., one mastered by doing rather than merely reasoning. Further, Aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge (like <!--del_lnk--> metaphysics and <!--del_lnk--> epistemology) but is general knowledge. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, <i><!--del_lnk--> Nichomachean Ethics</i>, in which he outlines what is commonly called <!--del_lnk--> virtue ethics.</p>
       <p>Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that man must have a function uncommon to anything else, and that this function must be an activity of the soul. Aristotle identified the best activity of the soul as <!--del_lnk--> eudaimonia: a happiness or joy that pervades the good life. Aristotle taught that to achieve the good life, one must live a balanced life and avoid excess. This balance, he taught, varies among different persons and situations, and exists as a <!--del_lnk--> golden mean between two vices - one an excess and one a deficiency.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Politics">Politics</span></h3>
       <p>In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled <i><!--del_lnk--> Politics</i>. Aristotle's conception of the city is very organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior to the <a href="../../wp/f/Family.htm" title="Family">family</a> which in turn is prior to the individual, i.e., last in the order of becoming, but first in the order of being . He is also famous for his statement that "man is by nature a political animal." Aristotle conceived of politics as being rather like an <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organism</a> than like a <!--del_lnk--> machine, and as a collection of parts that cannot exist without the other.</p>
       <p>It should be noted that the modern understanding of a political community is that of the <!--del_lnk--> state. However, the state was foreign to Aristotle. He referred to political communities as cities. Aristotle understood a city as a political "partnership" and not one of a <!--del_lnk--> social contract (or compact) or a political community as understood by <!--del_lnk--> Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli. Subsequently, a city is created not to avoid injustice or for economic stability , but rather to live a good life: "The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together" . This can be distinguished from the social contract theory which individuals leave the <!--del_lnk--> state of nature because of "fear of violent death" or its "inconveniences."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rhetoric_and_poetics">Rhetoric and poetics</span></h3>
       <p>Aristotle considered <!--del_lnk--> epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, <!--del_lnk--> dithyrambic poetry and <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a> to be <!--del_lnk--> imitative, each varying in imitation by media, object, and manner. For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. <!--del_lnk--> Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas <!--del_lnk--> tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitiation - through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. Aristotle believed that imitiation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.</p>
       <p>While it is believed that Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i> comprised two books - one on comedy and one on tragedy - only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the <!--del_lnk--> catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes <i>Poetics</i> with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_loss_of_his_works">The loss of his works</span></h2>
       <p>According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the "exoteric" and the "esoteric". Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works (esoteric) intended for the narrower audience of Aristotle's students and other philosophers who were familiar with the jargon and issues typical of the Platonic and Aristotelian schools. Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant - that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (<i>Fragments</i> of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that <!--del_lnk--> Cicero refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as "a river of gold"; it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us. However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero's praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle's extant works.</p>
       <p>One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us? The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by <!--del_lnk--> Strabo in his <i>Geography</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Parallel Lives</i>. The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor <!--del_lnk--> Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to <!--del_lnk--> Neleus of Scepsis. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to <!--del_lnk--> Scepsis, where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the first century BC, when <!--del_lnk--> Apellicon of Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Cornelius Sulla occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian <!--del_lnk--> Tyrranion of Amisus and then by philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Andronicus of Rhodes.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Carnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides "the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C." Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair. Second, there is "incontrovertible evidence," Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelean corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelean interpolations in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Politics</i>, for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.</p>
       <p>As the influence of the <i>falsafa</i> grew in the West, in part due to <!--del_lnk--> Gerard of Cremona's translations and the spread of <!--del_lnk--> Averroism, the demand for Aristotle's works grew. <!--del_lnk--> William of Moerbeke translated a number of them into Latin. When <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Aquinas.htm" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> wrote his <!--del_lnk--> theology, working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a> manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and ultimately revitalizing European thought through Muslim influence in Spain to fan the embers of the Renaissance.</p>

       <p>It is the opinion of many that Aristotle's system of thought remains the most influential one ever put together by any single mind. According to historian <!--del_lnk--> Will Durant, no other philosopher has contributed so much to the enlightenment of the world. He single-handedly founded the sciences of <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">Logic</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">Biology</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">Psychology</a>. At the opposite pole, <a href="../../wp/b/Bertrand_Russell.htm" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> dismissed much of Aristotle's work as not particularly profound.</p>
       <p>The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the <!--del_lnk--> Peripatetic school. Aristotle's notable students included <!--del_lnk--> Aristoxenus, <!--del_lnk--> Dicaearchus, <!--del_lnk--> Demetrius of Phalerum, <!--del_lnk--> Eudemos of Rhodes, <!--del_lnk--> Harpalus, <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestion, <!--del_lnk--> Meno, <!--del_lnk--> Mnason of Phocis, <!--del_lnk--> Nicomachus, and <!--del_lnk--> Theophrastus. (Alexander's tutelage under Aristotle should also be mentioned here, though it is unclear what the influence of this relationship was.)</p>
       <p>Aristotle is referred to as "The Philosopher" by <!--del_lnk--> Scholastic thinkers such as <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Aquinas.htm" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>. See <i><!--del_lnk--> Summa Theologica</i>, Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended <!--del_lnk--> Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet <a href="../../wp/g/Geoffrey_Chaucer.htm" title="Geoffrey Chaucer">Chaucer</a> describes his student as being happy by having</p>

        <dd><i>Twenty books clothed in blake or red</i></dd>
        <dd><i>Of Aristotle and his philosophie</i></dd>
       </dl>
       <p>The Italian poet <a href="../../wp/d/Dante_Alighieri.htm" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a> says of Aristotle in <!--del_lnk--> the first circles of hell,</p>
       <dl>
        <dd><i>I saw the Master there of those who know,</i></dd>
        <dd><i>Amid the philosophic family,</i></dd>
        <dd><i>By all admired, and by all reverenced;</i></dd>

        <dd><i>Who stood beside him closer than the rest.</i></dd>
       </dl>
       <p>The German philosopher <a href="../../wp/f/Friedrich_Nietzsche.htm" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle. However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue - or <i>arete</i> - of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is <!--del_lnk--> Martin Heidegger, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. More recently, <!--del_lnk--> Alasdair MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.</p>
       <p>The philosopher novelist <!--del_lnk--> Ayn Rand commented that in writing <!--del_lnk--> Atlas Shrugged the only philosopher to whom she could acknowledge a debt was Aristotle.</p>
