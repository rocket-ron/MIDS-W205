       <p>The <b>Atlantic Ocean</b> is the second-largest of the world's <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">oceanic</a> divisions; with a total area of about 106.4 million square kilometres (41.1 million square miles). It covers approximately one-fifth of the Earth's surface. The first part of its name refers to the <!--del_lnk--> Atlas of <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, making the Atlantic the "Sea of Atlas". The oldest known mention of this name is contained in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Histories</i> of <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> around 450 BC (I 202); see also: <i><a href="../../wp/a/Atlas_Mountains.htm" title="Atlas Mountains">Atlas Mountains</a></i>. Before Europeans discovered other oceans, the term "ocean" was synonymous with the waters beyond Western Europe that we now know as the Atlantic and which the Greeks had believed to be a gigantic river encircling the world; see <!--del_lnk--> Oceanus.</p>
       <p>The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between the <!--del_lnk--> Americas to the west, and <!--del_lnk--> Eurasia and <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> to the east. A component of the all-encompassing <!--del_lnk--> World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic_Ocean.htm" title="Arctic Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> (which is sometimes considered a sea of the Atlantic), to the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> in the southwest, the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> in the southeast, and the <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Ocean.htm" title="Southern Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> in the south. (Alternatively, in lieu of it connecting to the Southern Ocean, the Atlantic may be reckoned to extend southward to <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>.) The <a href="../../wp/e/Equator.htm" title="Equator">equator</a> subdivides it into the <b>North Atlantic Ocean</b> and <b>South Atlantic Ocean</b>.</p>

       <p>The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. In the north and northeast, it is separated from the Arctic Ocean by the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Arctic Archipelago, <a href="../../wp/g/Greenland.htm" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Jan_Mayen.htm" title="Jan Mayen">Jan Mayen</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Svalbard.htm" title="Svalbard">Svalbard</a>, and mainland <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the <!--del_lnk--> Denmark Strait, <!--del_lnk--> Greenland Sea, <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian Sea, and <!--del_lnk--> Barents Sea. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Gibraltar (where it connects with the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, one of its <!--del_lnk--> marginal seas, and, in turn, the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>), and Africa. In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean, the border being defined by the <!--del_lnk--> 20&deg; East meridian, running south from <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Agulhas.htm" title="Cape Agulhas">Cape Agulhas</a> to <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. While some authorities show the Atlantic Ocean extending south to <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, others show it as bounded at the <!--del_lnk--> 60&deg; parallel by the Southern Ocean. In the southwest, the <!--del_lnk--> Drake Passage connects it to the Pacific Ocean. A man-made link between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the <a href="../../wp/p/Panama_Canal.htm" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a>. Beside those mentioned, other large bodies of water adjacent to the Atlantic are the <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hudson_Bay.htm" title="Hudson Bay">Hudson Bay</a>, the Arctic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>, the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic Sea.</p>
       <p>Covering approximately 22% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific Ocean in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> square kilometers (41,100,000&nbsp;sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000&nbsp;sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> cubic kilometers (85,100,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> cu mi) and without them 323,600,000&nbsp;cubic kilometres (77,640,000&nbsp;cu mi).</p>
       <p>The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,339 meters (10,936 ft); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft). The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Rico Trench. The width of the Atlantic varies from 2,848 kilometers (1,770 mi) between <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sierra_Leone.htm" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a> to over 4,000&nbsp;mi (6,400&nbsp;km) in the south.</p>

       <p>The principal feature of the <!--del_lnk--> bathymetry (bottom <!--del_lnk--> topography) of the Atlantic Ocean is a submarine mountain range called the <!--del_lnk--> Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It extends from Iceland in the north to approximately 58&deg; South latitude, reaching a maximum width of about 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi). A great <!--del_lnk--> rift valley also extends along the ridge over most of its length. The depth of water over the ridge is less than 2,700 <!--del_lnk--> m (8,900 <!--del_lnk--> ft) in most places, and several mountain peaks rise above the water and form islands. The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the Walvis Ridge.</p>
       <p>The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large <!--del_lnk--> troughs with depths averaging between 3,700 and 5,500 metres (12,000 and 18,000 ft). Transverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins. Some of the larger basins are the <!--del_lnk--> Blake, Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic. The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.</p>
       <p>The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat, although numerous seamounts and some <!--del_lnk--> guyots exist. Several deeps or trenches are also found on the ocean floor. The <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Rico Trench, in the North Atlantic, is the deepest. The <!--del_lnk--> Laurentian Abyss is found off the eastern coast of <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>. In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="South Atlantic">South Atlantic</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> South Sandwich Trench reaches a depth of 8,428 metres (27,651 ft). A third major <!--del_lnk--> trench, the <!--del_lnk--> Romanche Trench, is located near the <a href="../../wp/e/Equator.htm" title="Equator">equator</a> and reaches a depth of about 7,454 metres (24,455 ft). The shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography. Several deep channels cut across the <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continental</a> rise.</p>
       <p>Ocean <a href="../../wp/s/Sediment.htm" title="Sediment">sediments</a> are composed of terrigenous, pelagic, and authigenic material. Terrigenous deposits consist of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by erosion, weathering, and volcanic activity on land and then washed to sea. These materials are found mostly on the <!--del_lnk--> continental shelves and are thickest off the mouths of large rivers or off desert coasts. Pelagic deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and <!--del_lnk--> Globigerina, <!--del_lnk--> pteropod, and siliceous oozes. Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from 60 to 3,300 metres (200 to 11,000 ft), they are thickest in the convergence belts and in the zones of upwelling. Authigenic deposits consist of such materials as <!--del_lnk--> manganese nodules. They occur where <a href="../../wp/s/Sediment.htm" title="Sediment">sedimentation</a> proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits</p>

       <p>On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the <!--del_lnk--> salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 - 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of <a href="../../wp/s/Sea_ice.htm" title="Sea ice">sea ice</a>. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25&deg; north and south of the equator, in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Subtropics.htm" title="Subtropical">subtropical</a> regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.</p>
       <p>Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than &minus;2&nbsp;&deg;<a href="../../wp/c/Celsius.htm" title="Celsius">C</a> to 29&nbsp;&deg;C (28&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F to 84&nbsp;&deg;F). Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7&nbsp;&deg;C to 8&nbsp;&deg;C (13 &deg;F to 14 &deg;F).</p>
       <p>The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The <!--del_lnk--> North Atlantic Deep Water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Bottom Water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).</p>
       <p>Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the <!--del_lnk--> Sargasso Sea, in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of <!--del_lnk--> seaweed and is also the spawning ground for both the <!--del_lnk--> European eel and the <!--del_lnk--> American eel.</p>
       <p>Because of the <!--del_lnk--> Coriolis effect, water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south <a href="../../wp/t/Tide.htm" title="Tide">tides</a> in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40&deg; North some east-west oscillation occurs.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less tendency toward extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. <!--del_lnk--> Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Stream and its northern extension towards Europe, the <!--del_lnk--> North Atlantic Drift, for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and north-western Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Banks area) and the north-western coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">Hurricanes</a> develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.</p>

       <p>The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of all five oceans. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 130 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral super continent, <!--del_lnk--> Pangaea, were being rifted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The <a href="../../wp/v/Vikings.htm" title="Vikings">Vikings</a>, the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the <!--del_lnk--> Americas (known as <!--del_lnk--> transatlantic trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, most famously the <!--del_lnk--> Challenger expedition, but also including those by the German Meteor expedition, <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy <!--del_lnk--> Hydrographic Office.</p>
       <p>While there is evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact of various dates, here are some important recent events in relation to the Atlantic:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>In 1000, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Leif_Ericson.htm" title="Leif Eiriksson">Leif Eiriksson</a> is the first European to discover the Atlantic coast of North America, including <!--del_lnk--> Vinland. The <!--del_lnk--> Norse discovery is documented in the 13th century <!--del_lnk--> Icelandic Sagas and is corroborated by recent <!--del_lnk--> archeological evidence.</li>
        <li>In 1003, <!--del_lnk--> Thorfinnr Karlsefni leads an attempted <!--del_lnk--> Viking settlement in North America but is driven off by the natives.</li>
        <li>In 1004, <!--del_lnk--> Snorri Thorfinsson is the first European born on the American continent.</li>
        <li>In 1492, <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> lands somewhere in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>.</li>

        <li>In 1858, the first <!--del_lnk--> transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by <!--del_lnk--> Cyrus West Field, though it rapidly failed.</li>
        <li>In 1865 the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by <a href="../../wp/i/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel.htm" title="Isambard Kingdom Brunel">Brunel</a>'s ship the <!--del_lnk--> Great Eastern.</li>

        <li>In 1919, the American <!--del_lnk--> NC-4 became the first <!--del_lnk--> fixed-wing aircraft (seaplane) to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands and the sea along the way, and taxied several hundred miles on the surface).</li>
        <li>Later in 1919, a British <!--del_lnk--> aeroplane piloted by <!--del_lnk--> Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland to <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>.</li>
        <li>In 1921, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an <a href="../../wp/a/Airship.htm" title="Airship">airship</a>.</li>

        <li>In 1927, <!--del_lnk--> Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an aircraft (between <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>).</li>
        <li>In 1952, <!--del_lnk--> Ann Davison was the first woman to single-handedly <!--del_lnk--> sail the Atlantic Ocean.</li>
        <li>In 1980, <!--del_lnk--> G&eacute;rard d'Aboville is the first man to cross the Atlantic Ocean rowing.</li>
        <li>In 1994, <!--del_lnk--> Guy Delage was the first man to swim across the Atlantic Ocean, from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cape_Verde.htm" title="Cape Verde islands">Cape Verde islands</a> to <a href="../../wp/b/Barbados.htm" title="Barbados">Barbados</a>.</li>
        <li>In 1998, <!--del_lnk--> Benoit Lecomte was the first man to swim across the northern Atlantic Ocean, stopping for only one week in the <!--del_lnk--> Azores.</li>
        <li>After rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), on <!--del_lnk--> December 3, <a href="../../wp/1/1999.htm" title="1999">1999</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Tori Murden became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by <!--del_lnk--> rowboat alone when she reached <a href="../../wp/g/Guadeloupe.htm" title="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> from the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands.</li>
       </ul>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
       <p>The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> deposits in the <a href="../../wp/s/Sedimentary_rock.htm" title="Sedimentary rock">sedimentary rocks</a> of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are <a href="../../wp/c/Cod.htm" title="Cod">cod</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Haddock.htm" title="Haddock">haddock</a>, <!--del_lnk--> hake, <!--del_lnk--> herring, and <!--del_lnk--> mackerel. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland, the shelf area off <!--del_lnk--> Nova Scotia, <!--del_lnk--> Georges Bank off <!--del_lnk--> Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_Sea.htm" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. <!--del_lnk--> Eel, <a href="../../wp/l/Lobster.htm" title="Lobster">lobster</a>, and <a href="../../wp/w/Whale.htm" title="Whale">whales</a> have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, <!--del_lnk--> marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.</p>

       <p>The surface is usually covered with sea ice in the <!--del_lnk--> Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait, and Baltic Sea from October to June. There is a clockwise warm-water <!--del_lnk--> gyre in the northern Atlantic, and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre in the southern Atlantic. The ocean floor is dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin, first discovered by the <!--del_lnk--> Challenger Expedition. This was formed by the vulcanism that also formed the floor of the Atlantic, and the islands rising from it.</p>
       <p>The Atlantic Ocean has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas.

       <p>In 2005, there was some concern that the currents warming northern Europe were slowing down, but no scientific consensus was formed based on the reported evidence.</p>
       <p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 7, <a href="../../wp/2/2006.htm" title="2006">2006</a>, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Marine_pollution">Marine pollution</span></h3>
       <p>Marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles. The biggest culprit are rivers that empty into the Ocean, and with it the many chemicals used as <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizers">fertilizers</a> in agriculture as well as waste from <!--del_lnk--> livestock and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Humans">humans</a>. The excess of oxygen depleting chemicals in the water leads to <!--del_lnk--> hypoxia and the creation of a <!--del_lnk--> dead zone.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is a term used to describe human-created waste that has found itself floating in a lake, sea, ocean or waterway. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the centre of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.</p>
