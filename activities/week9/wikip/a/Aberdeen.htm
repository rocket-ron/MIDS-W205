It has an official population estimate of 217,100. Nicknames include the <i>Granite City</i>, the <i>Grey City</i> and the <i>Silver City with the Golden Sands</i>. During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries, Aberdeen's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite, whose <!--del_lnk--> mica deposits sparkle like silver. The city has a long, sandy <!--del_lnk--> coastline. Since the discovery of <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea_oil.htm" title="North Sea oil">North Sea oil</a> in the 1970s, other nicknames have been the <i>Oil Capital of Europe</i> or the <i>Energy Capital of Europe</i>. The area around Aberdeen has been settled since at least 8,000 years ago, when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers <!--del_lnk--> Dee and <!--del_lnk--> Don. In 1319, Aberdeen received <!--del_lnk--> Royal Burgh status from <!--del_lnk--> Robert the Bruce, transforming the city economically. The city's two universities, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Aberdeen, founded in 1495, and the <!--del_lnk--> Robert Gordon University, which was awarded university status in 1992, make Aberdeen the educational centre of the north-east. The traditional industries of fishing, paper-making, shipbuilding, and textiles have been overtaken by the <!--del_lnk--> oil industry and Aberdeen's <!--del_lnk--> seaport. Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial <!--del_lnk--> heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland.</p>
       <p>Aberdeen has won the <!--del_lnk--> Britain in Bloom competition a record-breaking ten times, and hosts the <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen International Youth Festival, a major international event which attracts up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies.</p>

       <p>The Aberdeen area has seen human settlement for at least 8,000 years. The city began as two separate <!--del_lnk--> burghs: <!--del_lnk--> Old Aberdeen at the mouth of the river Don; and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement, where the Denburn waterway entered the river Dee estuary. The earliest <!--del_lnk--> charter was granted by <!--del_lnk--> William the Lion in 1179 and confirmed the corporate rights granted by <!--del_lnk--> David I. In 1319, the Great Charter of <!--del_lnk--> Robert the Bruce transformed Aberdeen into a property-owning and financially independent community. Granted with it was the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Forest of Stocket, whose income formed the basis for the city's <!--del_lnk--> Common Good Fund which still benefits Aberdonians. During the <!--del_lnk--> Wars of Scottish Independence, Aberdeen was under English rule, so <!--del_lnk--> Robert the Bruce laid siege to <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308 followed by the massacring of the English garrison and the retaking of Aberdeen for the townspeople. The city was burned by <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_III_of_England.htm" title="Edward III of England">Edward III of England</a> in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended, and called New Aberdeen. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770. During the <!--del_lnk--> Wars of the Three Kingdoms of 1644-1647 the city was impartially plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Aberdeen. In 1647 an outbreak of <!--del_lnk--> bubonic plague killed a quarter of the population. In the eighteenth century, a new Town Hall was built and the first social services appeared with the <!--del_lnk--> Infirmary at <!--del_lnk--> Woolmanhill in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779. The council began major road improvements at the end of the century with the main thoroughfares of <!--del_lnk--> George Street, <!--del_lnk--> King Street and <!--del_lnk--> Union Street all completed at the start of the next century. A century later, the increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the existing harbour with Victoria Dock, the South Breakwater, and the extension to the North Pier. The expensive infrastructure program had repercussions, and in 1817 the city was bankrupt. However, a recovery was made in the general prosperity which followed the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic wars</a>. Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865. The city was first <!--del_lnk--> incorporated in 1891. Although Old Aberdeen still has a separate charter and history, it and New Aberdeen are no longer truly distinct. They are both part of the city, along with Woodside and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Burgh of <!--del_lnk--> Torry to the south of the River Dee.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Toponymy">Toponymy</span></h3>
       <p>Old Aberdeen is the approximate location of <i>Aberdon</i> the first settlement of Aberdeen; this literally means "at the confluence of the Don [ie. with the sea]" in relation to the local river. The modern name Aberdeen literally means between the Dee (the other local river) and Don. The <!--del_lnk--> Celtic prefix; "Aber-" means "the confluence of" in relation to the rivers.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Gaelic scholars believe the name came from the prefix <i>Aber-</i> and <i>da-aevi</i> (variation;<i>Da-abhuin</i>, <i>Da-awin</i>) - which means "the mouth of two rivers". In Gaelic the name is <i>Obar Dheathain</i> (variation; <i>Obairreadhain</i>) and in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> referred to it as <i>Devana</i>. Mediaeval (or ecclesiastical) Latin has it as <i>Aberdonia</i>.</p>

       <p>Aberdeen is locally governed by Aberdeen City Council, which comprises forty-three councillors who represent the city's <!--del_lnk--> wards and is headed by the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Provost who is currently Provost Peter Stephen.</p>
       <p>From May 2003 until May 2007 the council was run by a <a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrat</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Conservative_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservatives</a> coalition. Following the May 2007 elections the Liberal Democrats formed a new coalition with the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_National_Party.htm" title="Scottish National Party">Scottish National Party</a>. In May 2007 the council consisted of: 15 Liberal Democrat, 13 SNP, 10 <a href="../../wp/l/Labour_Party_%2528UK%2529.htm" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a>, 4 Conservative councillors and a single independent councillor. After a SNP by election gain from the Conservatives on 16 August 2007, the Lib Dem/SNP coalition held 28 of the 43 seats). In August 2009 a councillor resigned from the Liberal Democrats and became an independent. The Conservative Group split in August 2010 with two councillors forming the Aberdeen Conservatives. All four Conservatives remain recognised as Conservatives by the party nationally.</p>

       <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Parliament the city is represented again by three constituencies, all of which are solely within the council area: <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen North, <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen Central and <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen South and by a further seven MSPs elected as part of the <!--del_lnk--> North East Scotland electoral region.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Symbols of the city typically show three castles, such as in the case of the flag and coat of arms. The image has been around since the time of <!--del_lnk--> Robert the Bruce and represents the buildings that stood on the three hills of Aberdeen; Aberdeen Castle on Castle Hill (today's <!--del_lnk--> castlegate); an unknown building on Windmill Hill and a church on St. Catherine's Hill (now levelled).</p>
       <p>"Bon Accord" is the <!--del_lnk--> motto of the city and is French literally for "Good Agreement". Legend tells that its use dates from the fourteenth century password used by Robert the Bruce during the <!--del_lnk--> Wars of Scottish Independence, when he and his men laid siege to Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> leopard has traditionally been associated with the city and its emblem can be seen on the city crest. The local magazine is called the "Leopard" and, when Union Bridge was constructed in the nineteenth century, small statues of the creature in a sitting position were cast and placed on top of the railing posts (known locally as Kelly's Cats).</p>
       <p>The city's toast is "Happy to meet, sorry to part, happy to meet again"; this has been commonly misinterpreted as the translation of Bon Accord.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geography">Geography</span></h2>
       <p>Being sited between two river mouths, the city has little natural exposure of bedrock. This leaves local geologists in a slight quandary&nbsp;: despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area (courtesy of the oil industry), there is only a vague understanding of what underlays the city. To the south side of the city, coastal cliffs expose high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Grampian Group; to the south-west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high-grade schists; to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead. And under the city itself? The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it's actually sited on an inlier of Devonian "Old Red" sandstones and silts. The outskirts of the city spread beyond the (inferred) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes formed during the <!--del_lnk--> Dalradian period (approximately 480-600 million years ago) with sporadic areas of <a href="../../wp/i/Igneous_rock.htm" title="Igneous rock">igneous</a> <!--del_lnk--> Diorite granites to be found, such as that at the <!--del_lnk--> Rubislaw quarry which was used to build much of the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian parts of the city.</p>
       <p>On the coast, Aberdeen has a long sand beach between the two rivers, the <!--del_lnk--> Dee and the <!--del_lnk--> Don, which turns into high <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Dune.htm" title="Sand dunes">sand dunes</a> north of the Don stretching as far as <!--del_lnk--> Fraserburgh&nbsp;; to the south of the Dee are steep rocky cliff faces with only minor pebble and shingle beaches in deep inlets. A number of granite outcrops along the south coast have been quarried in the past, making for spectacular scenery and good rock-climbing.</p>
       <p>The city extends to 184.46&nbsp;km&sup2; (71.22&nbsp;sq mi), and includes the former burghs of Old Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, <!--del_lnk--> Woodside and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Burgh of <!--del_lnk--> Torry to the south of <!--del_lnk--> River Dee. In 2010 this gave the city a population density of 1,169 / km&sup2;. The city is built on many hills, with the original beginnings of the city growing from Castle Hill, St. Catherine's Hill and Windmill Hill.</p>

Aberdeen is far milder than one might expect for its northern location. During the winter, especially throughout December, the length of the day is very short, averaging 6 hours and 40 minutes between sunrise and sunset at the Winter Solstice. As winter progresses, the length of the day grows fairly quickly, to 8 hours and 20 minutes by the end of January. As summer begins, the days will be around 18 hours long, having 17 hours and 57 minutes between sunrise and sunset, with Nautical Twilight lasting the entire night. Temperatures at this time of year will be hovering around 17&nbsp;&deg;C during the day.<br style="clear:both;" />

       <p>In 1396 the population was about 3,000. By 1801 it had become 26,992; (1901) 153,503; (1941) 182,467. In 2001 the UK <!--del_lnk--> census records the <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen City Council area's population at 212,125, but the Aberdeen locality's population at 184,788. The latest official population estimate, for 2010, is 217,100. Data from the Aberdeen specific locality of the 2001 UK census shows that the demographics include a median male age of 35 and female age of 38, which are younger than Scotland's average and a 49% to 51% male-to-female ratio.</p>
       <p>The census showed that there are fewer young people in Aberdeen, with 16.4% under 16, opposed to the national average of 19.2%. Ethnically, 15.7% were born outside of Scotland, higher than the national average of 12.9%. Of this population 8.4% were born in England. 3% of Aberdonians stated to be from an ethnic minority (non-white) in the 2001 census, with 0.7% from the Indian-subcontinent and 0.6% Asian; in comparison, Scotland's overall population of non-white origin is 2%. This is a lower percentage than any of Scotland's other three main cities, <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, and <a href="../../wp/d/Dundee.htm" title="Dundee">Dundee</a>. The most multicultural part of the city is George Street, which has many ethnic restaurants, supermarkets and hairdressers.</p>
       <p>In the household, there were 97,013 individual dwellings recorded in the city of which 61% were privately owned, 9% privately rented and 23% rented from the council. The most popular type of dwellings are apartments which compromise 49% of residences followed by semi-detached at just below 22%. The median income of a household in the city is &pound;16,813 (the mean income is &pound;20,292) (2005) which places approximately 18% households in the city below the poverty line (defined as 60% of the mean income). Conversely, an Aberdeen postcode has the second highest number of millionaires of any postcode in the UK.</p>

At this time, the city also was home to houses of the <!--del_lnk--> Carmelites (Whitefriars) and <!--del_lnk--> Franciscans (Greyfriars), the latter of which surviving in modified form as the chapel of Marischal College as late as the early twentieth Century.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> St Machar's Cathedral was formed twenty years after <!--del_lnk--> David I (1124&ndash;53) transferred the pre-Reformation <!--del_lnk--> Diocese from Mortlach in <!--del_lnk--> Banffshire to Old Aberdeen in 1137. With the exception of the episcopate of <!--del_lnk--> William Elphinstone (1484&ndash;1511), building progressed slowly. <!--del_lnk--> Gavin Dunbar, who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> St. Mary's Cathedral is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Cathedral in <!--del_lnk--> Gothic style, erected in 1859.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> St. Andrew's Cathedral is the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Episcopal_Church.htm" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish Episcopal</a> Cathedral, constructed in 1817 as Archibald Simpson's first commission. It is notable for having consecrated the first bishop of the <!--del_lnk--> Episcopal Church in the United States of America.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/t/The_Salvation_Army.htm" title="The Salvation Army">The Salvation Army</a> citadel dominates the east end of Union Street.</p>
       <p>There is a Unitarian Church, established in 1833 in Skene Terrace, near Union Street.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Christadelphians have been present in Aberdeen since at least 1844. Over the years, they have rented space to meet at a number of locations: the West Room of the Music Hall (for over 120 years); the Cowdry Club; the YWCA in Bon Accord Crescent. Today they meet in the Inchgarth Community Centre in Gathdee.</p>
       <p>There are two meetinghouses of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
       <p>There is also an <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> Mosque in Old Aberdeen and an Orthodox Jewish Synagogue established in 1945. There are no formal <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> or <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> buildings. The <!--del_lnk--> University of Aberdeen has a small <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;'&iacute; society.</p>
       <p>There is also a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Quakers.htm" title="Quaker">Quaker</a> meetinghouse on Crown street, the only purpose built <!--del_lnk--> Quaker House in Scotland that is still in use today.</p>

       <p>Traditionally, Aberdeen was home to fishing, textile mills, shipbuilding and paper making. These industries have been largely replaced. High technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing and the <!--del_lnk--> oil industry, which has been largely responsible for Aberdeen's economic boom in the last three decades, are now major parts of Aberdeen's economy.</p>
       <p>Until the 1970s, most of Aberdeen's leading industries dated from the eighteenth Century; mainly these were textiles, foundry work, shipbuilding and <!--del_lnk--> paper-making, the oldest industry in the city, with paper having been first made there in 1694. Paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of Donside Paper Mill in 2001 and the Davidson Mill in 2005 leaving the <!--del_lnk--> Stoneywood Paper Mill with a workforce of approximately 500. Textile production ended in 2004 when <!--del_lnk--> Richards of Aberdeen closed.</p>
       <p>Grey granite was <!--del_lnk--> quarried at <!--del_lnk--> Rubislaw quarry for more than 300 years, and used for paving setts, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental pieces. Aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Palace_of_Westminster.htm" title="Houses of Parliament">Houses of Parliament</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Waterloo Bridge in London. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971.</p>
       <p>Fishing was once the predominant industry, but was surpassed by deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the twentieth Century. Catches have fallen due to overfishing and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels, and so although still an important fishing port it is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of <!--del_lnk--> Peterhead and Fraserburgh. The <!--del_lnk--> Fisheries Research Services are headquartered in Aberdeen, and there is a marine research lab in Torry.</p>
       <p>Aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research carried out at <!--del_lnk--> The Macaulay Institute, which has close links to the city's two universities. The <!--del_lnk--> Rowett Research Institute is a world-renowned research centre for studies into food and nutrition located in Aberdeen. It has produced three Nobel laureates and there is a high concentration of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Life scientists">life scientists</a> working in the city.</p>
       <p>There is also a dynamic and fast growing electronics design and development industry.</p>
       <p>With the discovery of significant <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea_oil.htm" title="North Sea oil">oil deposits</a> in the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> during the late twentieth century, Aberdeen became the centre of Europe's <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> industry. With the second largest heliport in the world and an important service ship harbour port serving <!--del_lnk--> oil rigs off-shore, Aberdeen is often called the <i>Oil Capital of Europe</i>.</p>
       <p>There is now a concerted effort to transform Aberdeen's reputation as the <i>Oil Capital of Europe</i> into the <i>Energy Capital of Europe</i> as oil supplies may start to dwindle in coming years, and there is considerable interest in the development of new energy sources; and technology transfer from oil into renewable energy and other industries is under way. The "Energetica" initiative led by Scottish Enterprise has been designed to accelerate this process.</p>
       <p>The city ranks third in Scotland for shopping. The traditional shopping streets are <!--del_lnk--> Union Street and <!--del_lnk--> George Street, now complemented by shopping centres, notably the <!--del_lnk--> St Nicholas &amp; Bon Accord and the <!--del_lnk--> Trinity Shopping Centre. A new retail <!--del_lnk--> &pound;190 million development, Union Square, reached completion in late September/early October 2009. Major <!--del_lnk--> retail parks away from the city centre include the Berryden Retail Park, the Kittybrewster Retail Park and the Beach Boulevard Retail Park.</p>
       <p>In March 2004, Aberdeen was awarded <!--del_lnk--> Fairtrade City status by the <!--del_lnk--> Fairtrade Foundation. Along with Dundee, it shares the distinction of being the first city in Scotland to receive this accolade.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Landmarks">Landmarks</span></h2>
       <p>Aberdeen's <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architecture</a> is known for its principal use during the Victorian era of <a href="../../wp/g/Granite.htm" title="Granite">granite</a>, which has led to its local <!--del_lnk--> nickname of the <i>Granite City</i> or more romantically the less commonly used name the <i>Silver City</i>, since the <!--del_lnk--> Mica in the stone sparkles in the sun. The hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where <!--del_lnk--> sandstone has been used, the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry.</p>

       <p>Aberdeen has long been famous for its 45 outstanding <a href="../../wp/p/Park.htm" title="Park">parks</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Garden.htm" title="Garden">gardens</a>, and citywide floral displays which include two million roses, eleven million daffodils and three million crocuses. The city has won the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Horticultural Society's <!--del_lnk--> Britain in Bloom 'Best City' award ten times, the overall Scotland in Bloom competition twenty times and the large city category every year since 1968. At one point after winning a period of nine years straight, Aberdeen was banned from the Britain in Bloom competition to give another city a chance. The city won the 2006 Scotland in Bloom "Best City" award along with the International Cities in Bloom award. The suburb of Dyce also won the Small Towns award.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Duthie Park opened in 1899 on the north bank of the <!--del_lnk--> River Dee. It was named after and gifted to the city by Miss Elizabeth Crombie Duthie of Ruthrieston in 1881. It has extensive gardens, a rose hill, boating pond, bandstand, and play area as well as Europe's second largest enclosed gardens the David Welch Winter Gardens. <!--del_lnk--> Hazlehead Park, is large and forested, located on the outskirts of the city, it is popular with walkers in the forests, sports enthusiasts, naturalists and picnickers. There are football pitches, two golf courses, a pitch and putt course and a horse riding school.</p>
       <p>Aberdeen's success in the Britain in Bloom competitions is often attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Johnston Gardens, a small park of one hectare in the west end of the city containing many different flowers and plants which have been renowned for their beauty. The garden was in 2002, named the best garden in the <!--del_lnk--> British Islands.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Seaton Park, formerly the grounds of a private house, is on the edge of the grounds of <!--del_lnk--> St Machar's Cathedral. The Cathedral Walk is maintained in a formal style with a great variety of plants providing a popular display. The park includes several other areas with contrasting styles to this.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Union Terrace Gardens opened in 1879 and is situated in the centre of the city. It covers 2.5 acres (10,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) in the centre of Aberdeen bordered on three sides by Union Street, Union Terrace and Rosemount Viaduct. The park forms a natural amphitheatre located in the Denburn Valley and is an oasis of peace and calm in the city centre. A recent proposal to build a three storey concrete and steel superstructure in place of the gardens, part of which will provide a commercial concourse, has proved highly controversial.</p>
       <p>Situated next to each other, <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Park and <!--del_lnk--> Westburn Park cover 26 acres (110,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) between them. <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Park opened in 1871. There is a conservatory used as a seating area and a fountain made of fourteen different granites, presented to the people by the granite polishers and master builders of Aberdeen. Opposite to the north is <!--del_lnk--> Westburn Park opened in 1901. With large grass pitches it is widely used for field sports. There is large tennis centre with indoor and outdoor courts, a children's cycle track, play area and a grass boules lawn.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen Airport (ABZ), at Dyce in the north of the city, serves a number of domestic and international destinations including France, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Ireland and Scandinavian countries. The heliport which serves the oil industry and rescue services is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen railway station is on the main UK rail network and has frequent direct trains to major cities such as <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, Glasgow and London, including the overnight <!--del_lnk--> Caledonian Sleeper train. The station is currently being updated to bring it into the modern age. In 2007 additions were made and a new ticket office was built in the building.</p>
       <p>Until 2007, a 1950s-style concrete bus station at Guild Street served out-of-the-city locations; it has since transferred to a new and well-presented bus station just 100 metres to the east off Market Street as part of the Union Square development.</p>
       <p>There are six major roads in and out of the city. The A90 is the main arterial route into the city from the north and south, linking Aberdeen to Edinburgh, <a href="../../wp/d/Dundee.htm" title="Dundee">Dundee</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Brechin and <!--del_lnk--> Perth in the south and <!--del_lnk--> Ellon, <!--del_lnk--> Peterhead and Fraserburgh in the north.

After <!--del_lnk--> Braemar, it turns south, providing an alternative tourist route to Perth. The A944 also heads west, through <!--del_lnk--> Westhill and on to <!--del_lnk--> Alford. The A92 was the original southerly road to Aberdeen prior to the building of the A90, and is now used as a tourist route, connecting the towns of <!--del_lnk--> Montrose and <!--del_lnk--> Arbroath and on the east coast. The A947 exits the city at Dyce and goes on to <!--del_lnk--> Newmachar, <!--del_lnk--> Oldmeldrum and <!--del_lnk--> Turriff finally ending at <!--del_lnk--> Banff and <!--del_lnk--> Macduff.</p>
       <p>Aberdeen Harbour is important as the largest in the north of Scotland and as a ferry route to <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Shetland.htm" title="Shetland">Shetland</a>.

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Stagecoach Group also run buses in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, under the Stagecoach Bluebird brand. Other bus companies (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Megabus) run buses from the bus station to places north and south of the city.</p>
       <p>Aberdeen is connected to the UK <!--del_lnk--> National Cycle Network, and has a track to the south connecting to cities such as Dundee and Edinburgh and one to the north that forks about <span style="white-space:nowrap;">10 miles</span> from the city into two different tracks heading to Inverness and Fraserburgh respectively. Two particularly popular footpaths along old railway tracks are the <!--del_lnk--> Deeside Way to <!--del_lnk--> Banchory (which will eventually connect to Ballater) and the <!--del_lnk--> Formartine and Buchan Way to Ellon, both used by a mixture of cyclists, walkers and occasionally horses.

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Universities_and_colleges">Universities and colleges</span></h3>
       <p>Aberdeen has two universities, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Aberdeen and <!--del_lnk--> The Robert Gordon University. Aberdeen's student rate of 11.5% is higher than the national average of 7%.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> University of Aberdeen began as <!--del_lnk--> King's College, Aberdeen, which was founded in 1495 by <!--del_lnk--> William Elphinstone (1431&ndash;1514), <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Aberdeen and Chancellor of Scotland. <!--del_lnk--> Marischal College, a separate institution, was founded in "New" Aberdeen by George Keith, fifth Earl Marischal of Scotland in 1593. These institutions were amalgamated to form the present University of Aberdeen in 1860. The university is the fifth oldest in the English speaking world.</p>
