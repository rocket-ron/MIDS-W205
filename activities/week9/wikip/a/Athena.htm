       <p>Athena is also a shrewd companion of <!--del_lnk--> heroes and is the <!--del_lnk--> goddess of heroic endeavour. She is the <!--del_lnk--> virgin patroness of <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>. The Athenians founded the <a href="../../wp/p/Parthenon.htm" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> on the Acropolis of her namesake city, Athens (Athena Parthenos), in her honour.</p>
       <p>Athena's veneration as the patron of Athens seems to have existed from the earliest times, and was so persistent that archaic myths about her were recast to adapt to cultural changes. In her role as a protector of the city (<i><!--del_lnk--> polis</i>), many people throughout the Greek world worshiped Athena as <i>Athena Polias</i> (&#x1F08;&theta;&eta;&nu;&#x1FB6; &Pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&#x3AC;&sigmaf; "Athena of the city"). The city of <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a> and the goddess Athena essentially bear the same name, "Athenai" meaning "[many] Athenas".</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin_traditions">Origin traditions</span></h2>
       <p>The Greek philosopher <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> (429&ndash;347 BC) identified her with the <!--del_lnk--> Libyan deity <!--del_lnk--> Neith, the war goddess and huntress deity of the Egyptians since the ancient Pre-Dynastic period, who was also identified with <!--del_lnk--> weaving. This is sensible, as some Greeks identified Athena's birthplace, in certain mythological renditions, as being beside Libya's Triton River. Scholar Martin Bernal created the controversial "Black Athena Theory" to explain this associated origin by claiming that the conception of <!--del_lnk--> Neith was brought to Greece from Egypt, along with "an enormous number of features of civilization and culture in the third and second millennia."</p>

       <p>Athena as the goddess of philosophy became an aspect of the cult in Classical Greece during the late 5th century BC. She is the patroness of various crafts, especially of <!--del_lnk--> weaving, as <i>Athena Ergane</i>, and was honored as such at festivals such as <!--del_lnk--> Chalceia. The metalwork of weapons also fell under her patronage. She led battles (<i><!--del_lnk--> Athena Promachos</i> or the warrior maiden <i>Athena Parthenos</i>) as the disciplined, strategic side of war, in contrast to her brother <!--del_lnk--> Ares, the patron of violence, bloodlust and slaughter&mdash;"the raw force of war". Athena's wisdom includes the cunning intelligence (<i>metis</i>) of such figures as <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>. Not only was this version of Athena the opposite of Ares in combat, it was also the polar opposite of the serene earth goddess version of the deity, <i>Athena Polias</i>.</p>
       <p>Athena appears in Greek mythology as the patron and helper of many heroes, including <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Jason, and <a href="../../wp/h/Heracles.htm" title="Heracles">Heracles</a>. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greek.htm" title="Classical Greek">Classical Greek</a> myths, she never consorts with a lover, nor does she ever marry, earning the title <i>Athena Parthenos</i>. A remnant of archaic myth depicts her as the adoptive mother of <!--del_lnk--> Erechtheus/<!--del_lnk--> Erichthonius through the foiled rape by <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestus. Other variants relate that Erichthonius, the serpent that accompanied Athena, was born to <!--del_lnk--> Gaia: when the rape failed, the semen landed on Gaia and impregnated her. After Erechthonius was born, Gaia gave him to Athena.</p>
       <p>Though Athena is a goddess of war strategy, she disliked fighting without purpose and preferred to use wisdom to settle predicaments. The goddess only encouraged fighting for a reasonable cause or to resolve conflict. As patron of Athens she fought in the Trojan war on the side of the Achaeans.</p>

       <p>Although Athena appears before <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> at <!--del_lnk--> Knossos &mdash;in <!--del_lnk--> Linear B, as <i>a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja</i>, "Mistress Athena"&mdash;in the Classical <!--del_lnk--> Olympian pantheon, Athena was remade as the favorite daughter of Zeus, born fully armed from his forehead. The story of her birth comes in several versions. In the one most commonly cited, Zeus lay with Metis, the goddess of crafty thought and wisdom, but he immediately feared the consequences. It had been prophesied that Metis would bear children more powerful than the sire, even Zeus himself. In order to forestall these dire consequences, after lying with Metis, Zeus "put her away inside his own belly;" he "swallowed her down all of a sudden." He was too late: Metis had already conceived.</p>
       <p>Eventually Zeus experienced an enormous headache; <!--del_lnk--> Prometheus, <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestus, <!--del_lnk--> Hermes, <!--del_lnk--> Ares, or Palaemon (depending on the sources examined) cleaved Zeus's head with the double-headed <a href="../../wp/m/Minoan_civilization.htm" title="Minoan civilization">Minoan</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Axe.htm" title="Axe">axe</a>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> labrys</i>. Athena leaped from Zeus's head, fully grown and armed, with a shout&mdash; "and pealed to the broad sky her clarion cry of war. And Ouranos trembled to hear, and Mother Gaia..." (<!--del_lnk--> Pindar, <i>Seventh Olympian Ode</i>). Plato, in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Laws</i>, attributes the cult of Athena to the culture of <!--del_lnk--> Crete, introduced, he thought, from Libya during the dawn of Greek culture.</p>
       <p>Classical myths thereafter note that <!--del_lnk--> Hera was so annoyed at Zeus for having produced a child that she conceived and bore <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestus by <!--del_lnk--> herself.</p>
       <p>Plato, in <i><!--del_lnk--> Cratylus</i> (407B) gave the etymology of her name as signifying "the mind of god", <i>theou noesis</i>. The Christian apologist of the 2nd century <!--del_lnk--> Justin Martyr takes issue with those pagans who erect at springs images of <!--del_lnk--> Kore, whom he interprets as Athena:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>"They said that Athena was the daughter of Zeus not from intercourse, but when the god had in mind the making of a world through a word (<i><!--del_lnk--> logos</i>) his first thought was Athena".</p>
       </blockquote>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_origin_tales">Other origin tales</span></h4>
       <p>Some origin stories tell of Athena having been born outside of Olympus and raised by the god Triton. Fragments attributed by the Christian <!--del_lnk--> Eusebius of Caesarea to the semi-legendary <!--del_lnk--> Phoenician historian <!--del_lnk--> Sanchuniathon, which Eusebius thought had been written before the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan war">Trojan war</a>, make Athena instead the daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Cronus, a king of <!--del_lnk--> Byblos who visited 'the inhabitable world' and bequeathed <!--del_lnk--> Attica to Athena. Sanchuniathon's account would make Athena the sister of Zeus and Hera, not Zeus' daughter.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pallas_Athena">Pallas Athena</span></h3>
       <p>The major competing tradition regarding Athena's parentage involves some of her more mysterious <!--del_lnk--> epithets: Pallas, as in the ancient-Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&Pi;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&#x3AC;&sigmaf; &#x386;&theta;&#x3AE;&nu;&eta;</span> (also Pallantias) and Tritogeneia (also Trito, Tritonis, Tritoneia, Tritogenes). A distant archaic separate entity named <!--del_lnk--> Pallas is invoked (literate Greeks cannot remember the gender) as Athena's father, sister, foster sister, companion, or opponent in battle. Pallas is often a nymph, a daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Triton (a sea god), and a childhood friend of Athena.</p>
       <p>In every case, Athena kills Pallas, accidentally, and thereby gains the name for herself. In one telling, they practice the arts of war together until one day they have a falling out. As Pallas is about to strike Athena, Zeus intervenes. With Pallas stunned by a blow from Zeus, Athena takes advantage and kills her. Distraught over what she has done, Athena takes the name Pallas for herself.</p>
       <p>When Pallas is Athena's father the events, including her birth, are located near a body of water named Triton or <!--del_lnk--> Tritonis. When Pallas is Athena's sister or foster-sister, Athena's father or foster-father is <!--del_lnk--> Triton, the son and herald of <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon. But Athena may be called the daughter of Poseidon and a nymph named Tritonis, without involving Pallas. Likewise, Pallas may be Athena's father or opponent, without involving Triton. On this topic, Walter Burkert says "she is the Pallas of Athens, <i>Pallas Athenaie</i>, just as Hera of Argos is <i>Here Argeie</i>. For the Athenians, Burkert notes, Athena was simply "the Goddess", <i>h&#x113; the&oacute;s</i>, certainly an ancient title.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Athena_Parthenos:_Virgin_Athena"><i>Athena Parthenos</i>: Virgin Athena</span></h3>
       <p>Athena never had a consort or lover and is thus known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Athena Parthenos</i>, "Virgin Athena". Her most famous temple, the <a href="../../wp/p/Parthenon.htm" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, on the <!--del_lnk--> Acropolis in <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a> takes its name from this title. It is not merely an observation of her virginity, but a recognition of her role as enforcer of rules of sexual modesty and ritual mystery. Even beyond recognition, the Athenians allotted the goddess value based on this pureness of virginity as it upheld a rudiment of female behaviour in the patriarchal society. Kerenyi's study and theory of Athena accredits her virginal toponym to be a result of the relationship to her father Zeus and a vital, cohesive piece of her character throughout the ages.</p>
       <p>This role is expressed in a number of stories about Athena. <!--del_lnk--> Marinus of Neapolis reports that when Christians removed the statue of the Goddess from the <a href="../../wp/p/Parthenon.htm" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, a beautiful woman appeared in a dream to <!--del_lnk--> Proclus, a devotee of Athena, and announced that the <i>"Athenian Lady"</i> wished to dwell with him.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Hephaestus attempted to <!--del_lnk--> rape Athena, but she eluded him. His <!--del_lnk--> semen fell to the earth and impregnated the soil, and <!--del_lnk--> Erichthonius was born from the Earth, <!--del_lnk--> Gaia. Athena then raised the baby as a foster mother.</p>
       <p>Athena puts the infant Erichthonius into a small box (<i>cista</i>) which she entrusts to the care of three sisters, <!--del_lnk--> Herse, <!--del_lnk--> Pandrosus, and <!--del_lnk--> Aglaulus of Athens. The goddess does not tell them what the box contains, but warns them not to open it until she returns. One or two sisters opens the <i>cista</i> to reveal Erichthonius, in the form (or embrace) of a <!--del_lnk--> serpent. The serpent, or insanity induced by the sight, drives Herse and Aglaulus to throw themselves off the <!--del_lnk--> Acropolis. Jane Harrison (<i>Prolegomena</i>) finds this to be a simple cautionary tale directed at young girls carrying the <i>cista</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> Thesmophoria rituals, to discourage them from opening it outside the proper context.</p>
       <p>Another version of the myth of the Athenian maidens is told in <i><!--del_lnk--> Metamorphoses</i> by the Roman poet <!--del_lnk--> Ovid (43 BC &ndash; 17 AD); in this late variant <!--del_lnk--> Hermes falls in love with Herse. Herse, Aglaulus, and Pandrosus go to the temple to offer sacrifices to Athena. Hermes demands help from Aglaulus to seduce Herse. Aglaulus demands money in exchange. Hermes gives her the money the sisters have already offered to Athena. As punishment for Aglaulus's greed, Athena asks the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Envy to make Aglaulus jealous of Herse. When Hermes arrives to seduce Herse, Aglaulus stands in his way instead of helping him as she had agreed. He turns her to stone.</p>
       <p>With this mythic origin, Erichthonius became the founder-<!--del_lnk--> king of Athens, and many beneficial changes to Athenian culture were ascribed to him. During this time, Athena frequently protected him.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Medusa_and_Tiresias">Medusa and Tiresias</span></h4>
       <p>In a late myth, <!--del_lnk--> Medusa, unlike her sister Gorgons, came to be viewed by the Greeks of the 5th century as a beautiful mortal that served as priestess in Athena's temple. Poseidon liked Medusa, and decided to rape her in the temple of Athena, refusing to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way. Upon discovering the desecration of her temple, Athena changed Medusa's form to match that of her sister Gorgons as punishment. Medusa's hair turned into snakes, her lower body was transformed also, and meeting her gaze would turn any living man to stone. In the earliest myths, there is only one <!--del_lnk--> Gorgon, but there are two snakes that form a belt around her waist.</p>
       <p>In one version of the <!--del_lnk--> Tiresias myth, Tiresias stumbled upon Athena bathing, and he was struck blind by her to ensure he would never again see what man was not intended to see. But having lost his eyesight, he was given a special gift&mdash;to be able to understand the language of the birds (and thus to foretell the future).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lady_of_Athens">Lady of Athens</span></h3>
       <p>Athena competed with <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon to be the patron deity of Athens, which was yet unnamed, in a version of one <!--del_lnk--> founding myth. They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and that the Athenians would choose the gift they preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his <!--del_lnk--> trident and a salt water spring sprang up; this gave them a means of trade and water&mdash;Athens at its height was a significant sea power, defeating the <!--del_lnk--> Persian fleet at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Salamis&mdash;but the water was salty and not very good for drinking.</p>
       <p>Athena, however, offered them the first domesticated <!--del_lnk--> olive tree. The Athenians (or their king, <!--del_lnk--> Cecrops) accepted the olive tree and with it the patronage of Athena, for the olive tree brought wood, oil, and food. <!--del_lnk--> Robert Graves was of the opinion that "Poseidon's attempts to take possession of certain cities are political myths" which reflect the conflict between matriarchal and patriarchal religions.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_sites_of_cult">Other sites of cult</span></h4>
       <p>Athena also was the patron goddess of several other Greek cities, notably Sparta, where the archaic cult of <!--del_lnk--> Athena Alea had its sanctuaries in the surrounding villages of <!--del_lnk--> Mantineia and, notably, <!--del_lnk--> Tegea. In Sparta itself, the temple of Athena <i>Khalk&iacute;oikos</i> (Athena "of the Brazen House", often <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">latinized</a> as <i>Chalcioecus</i>) was the grandest and located on the Spartan acropolis; presumably it had a roof of bronze. The forecourt of the Brazen House was the place where the most solemn religious functions in Sparta took place.</p>
       <p>Tegea was an important religious centre of ancient Greece, containing the Temple of <!--del_lnk--> Athena Alea. The <i>temenos</i> was founded by <!--del_lnk--> Aleus, <!--del_lnk--> Pausanias was informed. Votive bronzes at the site from the Geometric and Archaic periods take the forms of horses and deer; there are <!--del_lnk--> sealstone and <!--del_lnk--> fibulae. In the Archaic period the nine villages that underlie Tegea banded together in a <!--del_lnk--> synoecism to form one city. Tegea was listed in <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> Catalogue of Ships as one of the cities that contributed ships and men for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="War of Troy">Achaean assault on Troy</a>.</p>

       <p>Later myths of the Classical Greeks relate that Athena guided <!--del_lnk--> Perseus in his quest to behead <!--del_lnk--> Medusa. She instructed <a href="../../wp/h/Heracles.htm" title="Heracles">Heracles</a> to skin the <!--del_lnk--> Nemean Lion by using its own claws to cut through its thick hide. She also helped Heracles to defeat the <!--del_lnk--> Stymphalian Birds, and to navigate the underworld so as to capture <!--del_lnk--> Cerberus.</p>

In the realistic epic mode, however, she largely is confined to aiding him only from <i>afar</i>, as by implanting thoughts in his head during his journey home from Troy. Her guiding actions reinforce her role as the "protectress of heroes" or as mythologian <!--del_lnk--> Walter Friedrich Otto dubbed her the "goddess of nearness" due to her mentoring and motherly probing. It is not until he washes up on the shore of an island where <!--del_lnk--> Nausicaa is washing her clothes that Athena arrives personally to provide more tangible assistance. She appears in Nausicaa's dreams to ensure that the princess rescues Odysseus and plays a role in his eventual escort to Ithaca.</p>
       <p>Athena appears in disguise to Odysseus upon his arrival, initially lying and telling him that Penelope, his wife, has remarried and that he is believed to be dead; but Odysseus lies back to her, employing skillful prevarications to protect himself. Impressed by his resolve and shrewdness, she reveals herself and tells him what he needs to know in order to win back his kingdom. She disguises him as an elderly man or beggar so that he cannot be noticed by the suitors or Penelope, and helps him to defeat the suitors.</p>
       <p>She also plays a role in ending the resultant feud against the suitors' relatives. She instructs Laertes to throw his spear and to kill the father of Antinous, Eupeithes.</p>

Only <!--del_lnk--> Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited. She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word &kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&#x3AF;&sigma;&tau;&#x1FC3; (kallist&#x113;i, "for the fairest"), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.</p>
       <p>The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favour one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a <!--del_lnk--> Trojan prince.

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Roman_fable_of_Arachne">Roman fable of Arachne</span></h3>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> fable of <!--del_lnk--> Arachne is a late Roman addition to Classical <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a> but does not appear in the myth repertoire of the Attic vase-painters. Arachne's name simply means <i>spider</i> (&alpha;&rho;&#x3AC;&chi;&nu;&eta;). Arachne was the daughter of a famous dyer in <!--del_lnk--> Tyrian purple in Hypaipa of <!--del_lnk--> Lydia, and a weaving student of Athena. She became so conceited of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of Athena herself.</p>
       <p>Athena gave Arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning Arachne not to offend the deities. Arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest, so she could prove her skill.</p>
       <p>Athena wove the scene of her victory over <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon that had inspired her patronage of Athens. According to Ovid's Latin narrative, Arachne's tapestry featured twenty-one episodes of the infidelity of the deities, including <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> being unfaithful with <!--del_lnk--> Leda, with <!--del_lnk--> Europa, and with <!--del_lnk--> Dana&euml;. Athena admitted that Arachne's work was flawless, but was outraged at Arachne's offensive choice of subjects that displayed the failings and transgressions of the deities. Finally, losing her temper, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and loom, striking it with her shuttle.</p>
       <p>Athena then struck Arachne with her staff, which changed her into a spider. In some versions, the destruction of her loom leads Arachne to hang herself in despair; Athena takes pity on her, and transforms her into a spider. In the aforementioned version, Arachne weaved scenes of joy while Athena weaved scenes of horror.</p>
       <p>The fable suggests that the origin of weaving lay in imitation of spiders and that it was considered to have been perfected first in <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor.</p>

       <p>In poetry from Homer, an oral tradition of the eighth or seventh century BC, onward, Athena's most common <!--del_lnk--> epithet is <i>glaukopis</i> (&gamma;&lambda;&alpha;&upsilon;&kappa;&#x3CE;&pi;&iota;&sigmaf;), which usually is translated as, <i>bright-eyed</i> or <i>with gleaming eyes</i>. The word is a combination of <i>glaukos</i> (&gamma;&lambda;&alpha;&#x3CD;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;, meaning <i>gleaming</i>, <i>silvery</i>, and later, <i>bluish-green</i> or <i>gray</i>) and <i>ops</i> (&#x3CE;&psi;, <i>eye</i>, or sometimes, <i>face</i>). It is interesting to note that <i>glaux</i> (&gamma;&lambda;&alpha;&#x3CD;&xi;, "owl") is from the same root, presumably because of the bird's own distinctive eyes. The bird which sees well in the night is closely associated with the goddess of <!--del_lnk--> wisdom: in archaic images, Athena is frequently depicted with an owl named the <!--del_lnk--> Glaucus (or "owl of Athena" and later under the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, "owl of <!--del_lnk--> Minerva") perched on her hand. This pairing evolved in tangent so that even in present day the owl is upheld as a symbol of perspicacity and erudition.</p>
       <p>Unsurprisingly, the owl became a sort of Athenian mascot. The <!--del_lnk--> olive tree is likewise sacred to her. In earlier times, Athena may well have been a <!--del_lnk--> bird goddess, similar to the unknown goddess depicted with owls, wings, and bird talons on the <!--del_lnk--> Burney relief, a Mesopotamian terracotta relief of the early second millennium BC.</p>
       <p>Other epithets include: <b>Aethyta</b> under which she was worshiped in <!--del_lnk--> Megara. The word <i>aithyia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&alpha;&#x1F34;&theta;&upsilon;&iota;&alpha;</span>) signifies a <i>diver</i>, and figuratively, a <i>ship</i>, so the name must reference Athena teaching the art of shipbuilding or navigation. In a temple at Phrixa in <!--del_lnk--> Elis, which was reportedly built by Clymenus, she was known as <b>Cydonia</b>.</p>
       <p>The various Athena subgroups, or cults, all branching from the central goddess herself often proctored various initiation rites of Grecian youth, for example, the passage into citizenship by young men and for women the elevation to the status of citizen wife. Her various cults were portals of a uniform socialization, even beyond mainland Greece.</p>

       <p>In the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i> (4.514), the <!--del_lnk--> Homeric Hymns, and in <!--del_lnk--> Hesiod's <i><!--del_lnk--> Theogony</i>, Athena is given the curious epithet <i>Tritogeneia.</i> The meaning of this term is unclear. It seems to mean "<!--del_lnk--> Triton-born", perhaps indicating that the sea-deity was her parent according to some early myths. In Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> Athena is occasionally referred to as "Tritonia".</p>
       <p>Another possible meaning may be <i>triple-born</i> or <i>third-born</i>, which may refer to a triad or to her status as the third daughter of Zeus or the fact she was born from Metis, Zeus, and herself; various legends list her as being the first child after Artemis and Apollo, though other legends identify her as Zeus' first child. The latter would have to be drawn from Classical myths, however, rather than earlier ones.</p>
       <p>In her role as judge at <!--del_lnk--> Orestes' trial on the murder of his mother, <!--del_lnk--> Clytemnestra (which he won), Athena won the epithet <i>Athena Areia</i>.</p>
       <p>Other epithets were <!--del_lnk--> Ageleia and <!--del_lnk--> Itonia.</p>

       <p>Athena was given many other cult titles. She has the epithet <i>Athena Ergane</i> as the patron of craftsmen and artisans. With the epithet <i><!--del_lnk--> Athena Parthenos</i> ("virgin") she was especially worshipped in the festivals of the <!--del_lnk--> Panathenaea and <!--del_lnk--> Pamboeotia where both militaristic and athletic displays took place. With the epithet <i><!--del_lnk--> Athena Promachos</i> she led in battle (see <!--del_lnk--> Promachos). With the epithet <i>Athena Polias</i> ("of the city"), Athena was the protector of not only Athens but also of many other cities, including <!--del_lnk--> Argos, <a href="../../wp/s/Sparta.htm" title="Sparta">Sparta</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Gortyn, <!--del_lnk--> Lindos, and <!--del_lnk--> Larisa.</p>
       <p>She was given the epithet <i><!--del_lnk--> Athena Hippeia</i> or <i>Athena Hippia</i> ("horse"), as the inventor of the <!--del_lnk--> chariot, and was worshiped under this title at Athens, <!--del_lnk--> Tegea and <!--del_lnk--> Olympia. As Athena Hippeia she was given an alternative parentage: <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon and <!--del_lnk--> Polyphe, daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Oceanus. In each of these cities her temple frequently was the major temple on the acropolis.</p>
       <p>Athena often was equated with <!--del_lnk--> Aphaea, a local goddess of the island of <!--del_lnk--> Aegina, located near <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, once Aegina was under Athenian's power. The Greek historian <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch (46&ndash;120 AD) also refers to an instance during the Parthenon's construction of her being called <i>Athena <!--del_lnk--> Hygieia</i> ("healer"):</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">

       <p>In classical times the <!--del_lnk--> Plynteria, or &ldquo;Feast of Adorning&rdquo;, was observed every May, it was a festival lasting five days. During this period the Priestesses of Athena, or &ldquo;Plyntrides&rdquo;, performed a cleansing ritual within &ldquo;the Erecththeum&rdquo;, the personal sanctuary of the goddess. Here Athena's statue was undressed, her clothes washed, and body purified.</p>
       <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Arcadia, she was assimilated with the ancient goddess Alea and worshiped as <!--del_lnk--> Athena Alea.</p>

       <p>Classically, Athena is portrayed wearing a full- length <!--del_lnk--> chiton, and sometimes in armor, with her helmet raised high on the forehead to reveal the image of <!--del_lnk--> Nike. Her shield bears at its centre the aegis with the head of the gorgon (gorgoneion) in the centre and snakes around the edge. It is in this standing posture that she was depicted in <!--del_lnk--> Phidias's famous lost <!--del_lnk--> gold and ivory statue of her, 36 m tall, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Athena Parthenos</i> in the <a href="../../wp/p/Parthenon.htm" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>. Athena also often is depicted with an <a href="../../wp/o/Owl.htm" title="Owl">owl</a> sitting on one of her shoulders.</p>
       <p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Mourning Athena</i> is a relief sculpture that dates around 460 BC and portrays a weary Athena resting on a staff. In earlier, archaic portraits of Athena in <!--del_lnk--> Black-figure pottery, the goddess retains some of her Minoan-Mycenaean character, such as great bird wings although this is not true of archaic sculpture such as those of <!--del_lnk--> Aphaean Athena, where Athena has subsumed an earlier, invisibly numinous&mdash;<i><!--del_lnk--> Aphaea</i>&mdash;goddess with Cretan connections in her <i>mythos</i>.</p>
       <p>Other commonly received and repeated types of Athena in sculpture may be found in <!--del_lnk--> this list.</p>
       <p>Apart from her attributes, there seems to be a relative consensus in late sculpture from the Classical period, the 5th century onward, as to what Athena looked like. Most noticeable in the face is perhaps the full round strong, masculine chin with a high nose that has a high bridge as a natural extension of the forehead. The eyes typically are somewhat deeply set. The unsmiling lips are usually full, but the mouth is depicted fairly narrow, usually just slightly wider than the nose. The neck is somewhat long. The net result is a serene, serious, somewhat aloof, and very masculine beauty.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Name.2C_etymology.2C_and_origin">Name, etymology, and origin</span></h2>
       <p>Athena had a special relationship with <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, as is shown by the etymological connection of the names of the goddess and the city. The citizens of Athens built a statue of Athena as a temple to the goddess, which had piercing eyes, a helmet on her head, attired with an <!--del_lnk--> aegis or <!--del_lnk--> cuirass, and an extremely long spear. It also had a crystal shield with the head of the Gorgon on it. A large snake accompanied her and she held the goddess of victory in her hand.</p>

       <p>Athena is associated with <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, a plural name because it was the place where she presided over her sisterhood, the <i>Athenai</i>, in earliest times: <!--del_lnk--> Mycenae was the city where the Goddess was called Mykene, and Mycenae is named in the plural for the sisterhood of females who tended her there. At <!--del_lnk--> Thebes she was called Thebe, and the city again a plural, Thebae (or Thebes, where the "s" is the plural formation). Similarly, at Athens she was called Athena, and the city Athenae (or Athens, again a plural)." Whether her name is attested in <!--del_lnk--> Eteocretan or not will have to wait for decipherment of <!--del_lnk--> Linear A.</p>
       <p>G&uuml;nther Neumann has suggested that Athena's name is possibly of <!--del_lnk--> Lydian origin; it may be a compound word derived in part from <!--del_lnk--> Tyrrhenian "ati", meaning <i>mother</i> and the name of the <!--del_lnk--> Hurrian goddess "<!--del_lnk--> Hannahannah" shortened in various places to "Ana". In <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean Greek, at <!--del_lnk--> Knossos a single inscription <i>A-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja</i> <i>/Athana potniya/</i> appears in the <!--del_lnk--> Linear B tablets from the Late Minoan II-era "Room of the Chariot Tablets"; these comprise the earliest Linear B archive anywhere.</p>
       <p>Although <i>Athana potniya</i> often is translated <i>Mistress Athena</i>, it literally means "the <i>potnia</i> of At(h)ana", which perhaps, means <i>the Lady of Athens</i>; Any connection to the city of Athens in the Knossos inscription is uncertain. We also find <i>A-ta-no-dju-wa-ja</i> <i>/Athana diwya/</i>, the final part being the Linear B spelling of what we know from Ancient Greek as <i>Diwia</i> (Mycenaean <i>di-u-ja</i> or <i>di-wi-ja</i>): <i><b>divine</b></i> Athena also was a weaver and the deity of crafts (see <i><!--del_lnk--> dyeus</i>).</p>
       <p>In his dialogue <i><!--del_lnk--> Cratylus</i>, the Greek philosopher <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>, 428/427 BC &ndash; 348/347 BC, gives the etymology of Athena's name, based on the view of the ancient Athenians:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">That is a graver matter, and there, my friend, the modern interpreters of Homer may, I think, assist in explaining the view of the ancients. For most of these in their explanations of the poet, assert that he meant by Athena "mind" [<i><!--del_lnk--> nous</i>] and "intelligence" [<i>dianoia</i>], and the maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her; and indeed calls her by a still higher title, "divine intelligence" [<i>Theian noesis</i>], as though he would say: This is she who has the mind better than others. Nor shall we be far wrong in supposing that the author of it wished to identify this Goddess with moral intelligence [<i>en ethei noesin</i>], and therefore gave her the name etheonoe; which, however, either he or his successors have altered into what they thought a nicer form, and called her Athena<i>.</i></div>
        <div class="templatequotecite"><i>&mdash;Plato,</i> Cratylus<i>, 407b</i></div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Thus for Plato her name was to be derived from Greek &#x1F08;&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&nu;&#x3CC;&alpha;, <i>Atheon&oacute;a</i>&mdash;which the later Greeks rationalised as from the deity's (<i>theos</i>) mind (<i>nous</i>).</p>
       <p>Plato noted that the Egyptian citizens of <!--del_lnk--> Sais in Egypt worshipped a goddess whose Egyptian name was <!--del_lnk--> Neith; and they identified her with Athena. (<i><!--del_lnk--> Timaeus</i> 21e), (<i><!--del_lnk--> Histories</i> 2:170&ndash;175).</p>
       <p>Some authors believe that, in early times, Athena was either an <a href="../../wp/o/Owl.htm" title="Owl">owl</a> herself or a <!--del_lnk--> bird goddess in general: in Book 3 of the <a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>, she takes the form of a <!--del_lnk--> sea-eagle. These authors argue that she dropped her prophylactic owl-mask before she lost her wings. "Athena, by the time she appears in art," Jane Ellen Harrison had remarked, "has completely shed her animal form, has reduced the shapes she once wore of snake and bird to attributes, but occasionally in <!--del_lnk--> black-figure vase-paintings she still appears with wings."</p>
       <p>Some Greek authors have derived natural symbols from the etymological roots of Athena's names to be aether, air, earth, and moon. This was one of the primary developments of scholarly exploration in the ancient world.</p>

       <p>A brief summary of Athena's evolution of myriad motifs after her dominance in Greece may be seen as follows: The rise of Christianity in Greece largely ended the worship of Greek deities and polytheism in general, but she resurfaced in the Middle Ages as a defender of sagacity and virtue so that her masculine warrior status was still intact. (She may be found on some family crests of nobility.) During the Renaissance she donned the mantle of patron of the arts and human endeavor and finally although not ultimately, Athena personified the miracles of freedom and republic during the French Revolution. (A statue of the goddess was centered on the Place de la Revolution in Paris.)</p>
       <p>For over a century <!--del_lnk--> a full-scale replica of the Parthenon has stood in <a href="../../wp/n/Nashville%252C_Tennessee.htm" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, which is known as <i>the Athens of the South</i>. In 1990, a gilded 41 feet (12.5 m) tall <!--del_lnk--> replica of Phidias' statue of Athena Parthenos was added. The state <!--del_lnk--> seal of California features an image of Athena (or Minerva) kneeling next to a brown grizzly bear.</p>
       <p>Athena is a natural patron of universities: she is the symbol of the <!--del_lnk--> Darmstadt University of Technology, in Germany, and the <!--del_lnk--> Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. Her image can be found in the shields of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and the Faculty of Sciences of the <!--del_lnk--> National Autonomous University of Mexico, where her owl is the symbol of the Faculty of Chemistry. At <!--del_lnk--> Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania a statue of Athena (a replica of the original bronze one in the arts and archaeology library) resides in the Great Hall. It is traditional at exam time for students to leave offerings to the goddess with a note asking for good luck, or to repent for accidentally breaking any of the college's numerous other traditions. Athena's owl also serves as the mascot of the college, and one of the college hymns is "Pallas Athena". Pallas Athena is the tutelary goddess of the international social fraternity <!--del_lnk--> Phi Delta Theta. Her owl is also a symbol of the fraternity.</p>
       <p>The title character in <a href="../../wp/e/Edgar_Allan_Poe.htm" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Raven</i> famously sits upon "a Bust of Pallas".</p>
       <p>She is the symbol of the United States Women's Navy and was depicted on their Unit Crest. A medal awarded to women who served in the Women Army Auxiliary Corps from 10 July 1942 to 31 August 1943, and to the Women Army Corps from 1 September 1943 to 2 September 1945 featured Athena on the front.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Jean Boucher's statue of the seated skeptical thinker <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Renan, shown to the left, caused great controversy when it was installed in Tr&eacute;guier, <!--del_lnk--> Brittany in 1902. Renan's 1862 biography of Jesus had denied his divinity, and he had written the "<!--del_lnk--> Prayer on the Acropolis" addressed to the goddess Athena. The statue was placed in the square fronted by the cathedral. Renan's head was turned away from the building, while Athena, beside him, was depicted raising her arm, which was interpreted as indicating a challenge to the church during an anti-clerical phase in French official culture. The installation was accompanied by a mass protest from local Roman Catholics and a religious service against the growth of <!--del_lnk--> skepticism and <!--del_lnk--> secularism.</p>

       <p>Athena has been used numerous times as a symbol of a republic by different countries and appears on currency as she did on the ancient <!--del_lnk--> drachma of Athens. Athena (Minerva) is the subject of the $50 1915-S Panama-Pacific <!--del_lnk--> commemorative coin. At 2.5 troy oz (78 g) gold, this is the largest (by <!--del_lnk--> weight) coin ever produced by the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Mint. This was the first $50 coin issued by the U.S. Mint and no higher was produced until the production of the $100 platinum coins in 1997. Of course, in terms of face-value in adjusted dollars, the 1915 is the highest denomination ever issued by the U.S. Mint.</p>
       <p>Athena was depicted on the <!--del_lnk--> obverse of the Greek 100 <!--del_lnk--> drachmas banknote of 1978-2001. Another recent example is the <!--del_lnk--> 60 Years of the Second Republic commemorative coin issued by Austria in 2005. Athena is depicted in the obverse of the coin, representing the Austrian Republic.</p>
       <p>She appears briefly in Disney's <i><!--del_lnk--> Hercules</i>, but has a more dominant role in the television series.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Athena is an active character in <!--del_lnk--> Marvel Comics' main continuity, the <!--del_lnk--> Marvel Universe, most recently in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Incredible Hercules</i> series. She acts as a guide to <!--del_lnk--> Hercules and his sidekick, boy genius <!--del_lnk--> Amadeus Cho.</p>
       <p>Athena appears in <!--del_lnk--> Rick Riordan's <i><!--del_lnk--> Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians</i> book series. Her daughter, born from her head as she was from Zeus's, <!--del_lnk--> demigod <!--del_lnk--> Annabeth Chase is one of the principal characters. Annabeth's father found her (Annabeth) lying in a golden cradle at the doorstep.</p>
       <p>The Roman name for Athena is Minerva. In the video game Assassin's Creed II, Minerva appears in an ancient vault underneath the Vatican at the end of the game. She explains the origin of mankind within the story to the game's main protagonist, Desmond Miles, through his ancestor, Ezio Auditore.</p>
       <p>Athena appears in the television series <i><a href="../../wp/s/Stargate_SG-1.htm" title="Stargate SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a></i> when she kidnaps <!--del_lnk--> Vala Mal Doran to gain information on the <!--del_lnk--> Clava Thessara Infinitas (The Key to Infinite Treasure).</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Masculinity_and_feminism">Masculinity and feminism</span></h2>
       <p>Athena had an "androgynous compromise" that allowed her traits and what she stood for to be attributed to male and female rulers alike over the course of history (such as Marie de' Medici, Anne of Austria, Christina of Sweden, and Catherine the Great).</p>
       <p>J.J. Bachofen advocated that Athena was originally a maternal figure stable in her security and poise but was caught up and perverted by a patriarchal society; this was especially the case in Athens. The goddess adapted but could very easily be seen as a god. He viewed it as "motherless paternity in the place of fatherless maternity" where once altered, Athena's character was to be crystallized as that of a patriarch.</p>
       <p>Whereas Bachofen saw the switch to paternity on Athena's behalf as an increase of power, Freud on the contrary perceived Athena as an "original mother goddess divested of her power". In this interpretation, Athena was demoted to be only Zeus's daughter, never allowed the expression of motherhood. Still more different from Bachofen's perspective is the lack of role permanency in Freud's view: Freud held that time and differing cultures would mold Athena to stand for what was necessary to them.</p>
