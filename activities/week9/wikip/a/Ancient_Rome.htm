       <p><b>Ancient Rome</b> was a thriving <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a> that began growing on the <!--del_lnk--> Italian Peninsula as early as the 8th century BC. Located along the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and centered on the city of <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_history.htm" title="Ancient history">ancient world</a>.</p>
       <p>In its approximately twelve centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy.htm" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a> to an aristocratic <!--del_lnk--> republic to an increasingly autocratic <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">empire</a>. Through <a href="../../wp/i/Invasion.htm" title="Invasion">conquest</a> and <!--del_lnk--> assimilation, it came to dominate <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Europe.htm" title="Southern Europe">Southern Europe</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe, <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor, <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, parts of <!--del_lnk--> Northern Europe, and parts of <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Europe.htm" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>. Rome was preponderant throughout the Mediterranean region and was one of the most powerful entities of the ancient world. It is often grouped into "<!--del_lnk--> Classical Antiquity" together with <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>, and their similar cultures and societies are known as the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Roman world.</p>
       <p>The Romans are still remembered today, including names such as <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Cicero, <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Augustus</a>, etc. Ancient Roman society contributed greatly to government, law, politics, engineering, art, literature, architecture, technology, warfare, <!--del_lnk--> religion, language, society and more in the Western world. A civilization highly developed for its time, Rome professionalized and greatly expanded its military and created a system of government called <i><!--del_lnk--> res publica</i>, the inspiration for modern republics such as the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. It achieved impressive <!--del_lnk--> technological and <!--del_lnk--> architectural feats, such as the construction of an extensive system of <!--del_lnk--> aqueducts and <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_roads.htm" title="Roman roads">roads</a>, as well as large monuments, palaces, and public facilities.</p>
       <p>By the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Republic, Rome had conquered the lands around the Mediterranean and beyond: its domain extended from the Atlantic to <!--del_lnk--> Judaea and from the mouth of the <a href="../../wp/r/Rhine.htm" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> to North Africa. The Roman <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Empire</a> emerged under the leadership of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus Caesar">Augustus Caesar</a>. Under <!--del_lnk--> Trajan, the Empire reached its territorial peak. Republican mores and traditions started to decline during the imperial period, with civil wars becoming a common ritual for a new emperor's rise.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Plagued by internal instability and <!--del_lnk--> attacked by various migrating peoples, the <a href="../../wp/w/Western_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Western Roman Empire">western part of the empire</a> broke up into independent kingdoms in the 5th century. This splintering is a landmark historians use to divide the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Ancient_history.htm" title="Ancient">ancient</a> period of <!--del_lnk--> universal history from the pre-mediaeval "<a href="../../wp/d/Dark_Ages_%2528historiography%2529.htm" title="Dark Ages (historiography)">Dark Ages</a>" of Europe. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Eastern Roman Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a> survived this crisis and was governed from <a href="../../wp/c/Constantinople.htm" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> after the division of the Empire. It comprised <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Greece.htm" title="Roman Greece">Greece</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Balkans, <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor, <!--del_lnk--> Syria and <!--del_lnk--> Egypt. Despite the later loss of Syria and Egypt to the <!--del_lnk--> Arab-Islamic Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire continued for another <!--del_lnk--> millennium, until its remnants were finally <!--del_lnk--> annexed by the emerging Turkish <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. This eastern, Christian, <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">medieval</a> stage of the Empire is usually called the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> by historians.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> founding myth of Rome, the city was <!--del_lnk--> founded on 21 April 753 BC by twin brothers <!--del_lnk--> Romulus and Remus, who descended from the <!--del_lnk--> Trojan prince <!--del_lnk--> Aeneas and who were grandsons of the Latin King, <!--del_lnk--> Numitor of <!--del_lnk--> Alba Longa. King Numitor was deposed from his throne by his brother, <!--del_lnk--> Amulius, while Numitor's daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Rhea Silvia, gave birth to the twins. Because Rhea Silvia was raped and impregnated by <!--del_lnk--> Mars, the Roman <!--del_lnk--> god of war, the twins were considered <!--del_lnk--> half-divine.</p>
       <p>The new king feared Romulus and Remus would take back the throne, so he ordered them to be drowned. A she-wolf (or a shepherd's wife in some accounts) saved and raised them, and when they were old enough, they returned the throne of Alba Longa to Numitor.</p>
       <p>The twins then founded their own city, but Romulus killed Remus in a quarrel over the location of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Kingdom, though some sources state the quarrel was about who was going to rule or give his name to the city. Romulus became the source of the city's name. In order to attract people to the city, Rome became a sanctuary for the indigent, exiled, and unwanted. This caused a problem for Rome, which had a large workforce but was bereft of women. Romulus traveled to the neighboring towns and tribes and attempted to secure marriage rights but as Rome was so full of undesirables they all refused. Legend says that the Latins invited the <!--del_lnk--> Sabines to a festival and <!--del_lnk--> stole their unmarried maidens, leading to the integration of the Latins and the Sabines.</p>
       <p>Another legend, recorded by Greek historian <!--del_lnk--> Dionysius of Halicarnassus, says that Prince Aeneas led a group of Trojans on a sea voyage to found a new Troy, since the original was destroyed in the outcome of the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>. After a long time in rough seas, they landed at the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Tiber River. Not long after they landed, the men wanted to take to the sea again, but the women who were traveling with them did not want to leave. One woman, named Roma, suggested that the women burn the ships out at sea to prevent them from leaving. At first, the men were angry with Roma, but they soon realized that they were in the ideal place to settle. They named the settlement after the woman who torched their ships.</p>
       <p>The Roman poet <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/v/Virgil.htm" title="Vergil">Vergil</a> recounted this legend on his classical epic poem <i><!--del_lnk--> Aeneid</i>. In the <i>Aeneid</i>, the Trojan prince <!--del_lnk--> Aeneas is destined by the gods in his enterprise of founding a new Troy. In the epic, the women also refused to go back to the sea, but they were not left on the Tiber. After reaching Italy, Aeneas, who wanted to marry <!--del_lnk--> Lavinia, was forced to wage war with her former suitor, <!--del_lnk--> Turnus. According to the poem, the <!--del_lnk--> Alban kings were descended from Aeneas, and thus, Romulus, the founder of Rome, was his descendant.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kingdom">Kingdom</span></h3>
       <p>The city of Rome grew from settlements around a ford on the river <!--del_lnk--> Tiber, a crossroads of traffic and trade. According to <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">archaeological</a> evidence, the village of Rome was probably founded sometime in the 8th century BC, though it may go back as far as the 10th century BC, by members of the <!--del_lnk--> Latin tribe of Italy, on the top of the <!--del_lnk--> Palatine Hill.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Etruscans, who had previously settled to the north in <!--del_lnk--> Etruria, seem to have established political control in the region by the late 7th century BC, forming the aristocratic and monarchical elite. The Etruscans apparently lost power in the area by the late 6th century BC, and at this point, the original Latin and Sabine tribes reinvented their government by creating a <!--del_lnk--> republic, with much greater restraints on the ability of rulers to exercise power.</p>
       <p>Roman tradition and archaeological evidence point to a complex within the <!--del_lnk--> Forum Romanum as the seat of power for the king and the beginnings of the religious centre there as well. <!--del_lnk--> Numa Pompilius was the second <!--del_lnk--> king of Rome, succeeding <!--del_lnk--> Romulus. He began Rome's great building projects with his royal palace the <!--del_lnk--> Regia and the complex of the <!--del_lnk--> Vestal virgins.</p>

       <p>According to tradition and later writers such as <!--del_lnk--> Livy, the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic was established around 509 BC, when the last of the seven kings of Rome, <!--del_lnk--> Tarquin the Proud, was deposed by <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Junius Brutus, and a system based on annually elected <!--del_lnk--> magistrates and various representative assemblies was established. A <!--del_lnk--> constitution set a series of <!--del_lnk--> checks and balances, and a <!--del_lnk--> separation of powers. The most important magistrates were the two consuls, who together exercised executive authority as <i><!--del_lnk--> imperium</i>, or military command. The consuls had to work with the <!--del_lnk--> senate, which was initially an advisory council of the ranking nobility, or <!--del_lnk--> patricians, but grew in size and power.</p>
       <p>Other magistracies in the Republic include <!--del_lnk--> tribunes, <!--del_lnk--> quaestors, <!--del_lnk--> aediles, <!--del_lnk--> praetors and <!--del_lnk--> censors. The magistracies were originally restricted to patricians, but were later opened to common people, or <!--del_lnk--> plebeians. Republican voting assemblies included the <i>comitia centuriata</i> (centuriate assembly), which voted on matters of war and peace and elected men to the most important offices, and the <i>comitia tributa</i> (tribal assembly), which elected less important offices.</p>

       <p>In the 4th century BC Rome had come under attack by the Gauls. The Gauls until that time had only extended to the Po Valley in the Italian peninsula. The Gauls had been penetrating deep into Etruria, so the Romans decided to join in on the melee. With Etruria completely gone, the Gauls continued their advance south which led them into a fight with the Romans. On 16 July 390 BC, a Gallic army under the leadership of a tribal chieftain named Brennus, met the Romans on the Banks of the small Allia River just ten miles north of Rome. Brennus defeated the Romans, afterwards the Gauls marched directly to Rome. Most Romans had fled the city, those who were capable of fighting barricaded themselves upon the Capitoline Hill for a last stand. The Gauls looted and burned the city, then laid siege to the Capitoline Hill. The siege lasted seven months, the Gauls then agreed to a compromise peace. The Romans were forced to pay the Gauls 1,000 pounds of gold. According to legend, the Roman General supervising the weighing noticed that the Gauls were using false scales. The Romans then took up arms and drove the Gauls back, and then an army led by <!--del_lnk--> Camillus defeated the Gauls and he said, "With iron, not with gold, Rome buys her freedom."</p>
       <p>The Romans <!--del_lnk--> gradually subdued the other peoples on the Italian peninsula, including the <!--del_lnk--> Etruscans. The last threat to Roman <!--del_lnk--> hegemony in Italy came when <!--del_lnk--> Tarentum, a major <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> colony, enlisted the aid of <!--del_lnk--> Pyrrhus of Epirus in 281 BC, but this effort failed as well. The Romans secured their conquests by founding <!--del_lnk--> Roman colonies in strategic areas, thereby establishing stable control over the region of Italy.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Punic_Wars">Punic Wars</span></h4>
       <p>In the 3rd century BC Rome had to face a new and formidable opponent: <!--del_lnk--> Carthage. Carthage was a rich, flourishing Phoenician city-state that intended to dominate the Mediterranean area. The two cities were allies in the times of Pyrrhus, who was a menace to both, but with Rome's hegemony in mainland Italy and the Carthaginian <!--del_lnk--> thalassocracy, these cities became the two major powers in the Western Mediterranean &ndash; a signal of the imminent war.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> First Punic War war begun in 264 BC, when the city of <!--del_lnk--> Messana asked for Carthage's help in dealing with <!--del_lnk--> Hiero II of Syracuse. After the Carthaginian intercession, Messana asked Rome to expel the Carthaginians. Rome entered this war because Syracuse and Messana were too close of the newly conquered Greek cities of Southern Italy and Carthage was now able to make an offensive through Roman territory; along with this, Rome could extend its domain over Sicily.</p>
       <p>Although the Romans had experience in land battles, to defeat this new enemy, naval battles were necessary. Carthage was a maritime power, and the Roman lack of ships and naval experience would make the path to the victory harsh for the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic. Despite this, after more than 20 years of war, Rome finally defeated Carthage and a peace treaty was signed. Among the reasons for the <!--del_lnk--> Second Punic War was the subsequent war reparations Carthage acquiesced to at the end of the First Punic War.</p>
       <p>The Second Punic War is famous for its brilliant generals: on the Punic side <a href="../../wp/h/Hannibal.htm" title="Hannibal">Hannibal</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Hasdrubal, and the Romans <!--del_lnk--> Marcellus, <!--del_lnk--> Fabius Maximus and <!--del_lnk--> Scipio Africanus. Rome faced this war simultaneously with the <a href="../../wp/f/First_Macedonian_War.htm" title="First Macedonian War">First Macedonian War</a>.</p>
       <p>The outbreak of the war was the audacious invasion of Italy led by Hannibal, son of <!--del_lnk--> Hamilcar Barca the Carthaginian general who was in charge of Sicily the First Punic War. Hannibal rapidly marched through <!--del_lnk--> Hispania and the <!--del_lnk--> Alps. This invasion caused panic in the cities and the only way to deflect Hannibal's intentions was to delay him in small battles. This strategy was led by Fabius Maximus, who would be nicknamed <i>Cunctator</i> ("delayer" in Latin), and until this day is called <!--del_lnk--> Fabian strategy. Due to this, Hannibal's goal was unachieved: he couldn't bring Italian cities to revolt against Rome and as his army diminished after every battle, he lacked machines and manpower to besiege Rome.</p>
       <p>Hannibal's invasion lasted over 16 years, by ravaging the supplies of the Italian cities and fields. When the Romans perceived that his supplies were running out, they invaded the unprotected Carthage and forced Hannibal to go back to that city. On his return he faced Scipio, who had defeated his brother Hasdrubal. The result of this confrontation was the end of the Second Punic War in the famous <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Zama in October 202 BC, which gave to Scipio his <!--del_lnk--> agnomen <i>Africanus</i>. Rome's final debt was of many deaths, but also of resounding gains: the conquest of Hispania by Scipio and of Syracuse, the last Greek realm in Sicily, by <!--del_lnk--> Marcellus.</p>
       <p>More than a half century after these events, Carthage was humiliated and Rome was no more concerned about the African menace. The Republic's focus now was only to the <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic kingdoms of Greece and revolts in Hispania. However, Carthage after having paid the war indemnity, felt that its commitments and submission to Rome had ceased &ndash; a vision not shared by the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Senate. In 151 BC <!--del_lnk--> Numidia invaded Carthage, and after asking for Roman help, ambassadors were sent to Carthage, among them was <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Porcius Cato, who after seeing that Carthage could make a comeback and regain its importance, ended all his speeches, no matter what the subject was, by saying: "<i><!--del_lnk--> Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam</i>" ("Furthermore, I think that Carthage must be destroyed").</p>
       <p>As Carthage fought with Numidia without Roman consent, Rome declared war against Carthage in 149 BC. Carthage resisted well at the first strike, with the participation of all the inhabitants of the city. However, Carthage could not withstand the attack of <!--del_lnk--> Scipio Aemilianus, who entirely destroyed the city and its walls, enslaved and sold all the citizens and gained control of that region, which became the province of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa_%2528Roman_province%2529.htm" title="Africa (Roman province)">Africa</a> and thus, ending the Punic War period.</p>
       <p>All these wars resulted in Rome's first overseas conquests, of <!--del_lnk--> Sicily, <!--del_lnk--> Hispania and Africa and the <!--del_lnk--> rise of Rome as a significant imperial power.</p>

Senators became rich at the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_province.htm" title="Roman province">provinces</a>' expense, but soldiers, who were mostly small-scale farmers, were away from home longer and could not maintain their land, and the increased reliance on foreign <!--del_lnk--> slaves and the growth of <i><!--del_lnk--> latifundia</i> reduced the availability of paid work.</p>
       <p>Income from war booty, <a href="../../wp/m/Mercantilism.htm" title="Mercantilism">mercantilism</a> in the new provinces, and <!--del_lnk--> tax farming created new economic opportunities for the wealthy, forming a new class of <!--del_lnk--> merchants, the <!--del_lnk--> equestrians. The <i><!--del_lnk--> lex Claudia</i> forbade members of the Senate from engaging in commerce, so while the equestrians could theoretically join the Senate, they were severely restricted in political power. The Senate squabbled perpetually, repeatedly blocking important <!--del_lnk--> land reforms and refusing to give the equestrian class a larger say in the government.</p>
       <p>Violent gangs of the urban unemployed, controlled by rival Senators, intimidated the electorate through violence. The situation came to a head in the late 2nd century BC under the <!--del_lnk--> Gracchi brothers, a pair of <!--del_lnk--> tribunes who attempted to pass land reform legislation that would redistribute the major patrician landholdings among the plebeians. Both brothers were killed and the Senate passed reforms reversing the Gracchi brother's actions. This led to the growing divide of the plebeian groups (<!--del_lnk--> populares) and equestrian classes (<!--del_lnk--> optimates).</p>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Marius_and_Sulla">Marius and Sulla</span></h5>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Gaius Marius, a <i><!--del_lnk--> novus homo</i>, started his political career with the help of the powerful <!--del_lnk--> Metelli and soon become a leader of the Republic, holding the first of his seven consulships (a unprecedented experience) in 107 BC by arguing that his former patron <!--del_lnk--> Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus was not able to defeat and capture the Numidian king <!--del_lnk--> Jugurtha. Marius then started his military reform: in his recruitment to fight Jugurtha, he levied very poor men (an innovation), and many landless men entered the army &ndash; this was the seed of securing loyalty of the army to the General in command.</p>
       <p>At this time, Marius began his quarrel with <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Cornelius Sulla: Marius, who wanted to capture Jugurtha, asked <!--del_lnk--> Bocchus, son-in-law of Jugurtha, to hand him over to the Romans. As Marius failed, Sulla &ndash; a legate of Marius at that time &ndash; went himself to Bocchus in a dangerous enterprise and convinced Bocchus to hand Jugurtha over to him. This was very provocative to Marius, since many of his enemies were encouraging Sulla to oppose Marius. Despite this, Marius was elected for five consecutive consulships from 104&ndash;100 BC, because Rome needed a military leader to defeat the <!--del_lnk--> Cimbri and the <!--del_lnk--> Teutones, who were threatening Rome.</p>

       </div>
       <p>After Marius's retirement, Rome had a brief peace, which was broken due to the assassination of the reformist <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Livius Drusus, and this triggered the <!--del_lnk--> Social War. This war was caused when the Italian <i>socii</i> ("allies" in Latin) revolted against the Romans, as they were not entitled to Roman citizenship and voting rights. This brought Marius back to the military and political fore, because after the deaths of the consuls he was appointed to command the army together with <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Julius Caesar and Sulla.</p>
       <p>By the ending of the Social War, the partisans of Marius and Sulla were in conflict, both sides jostling for power. In 88 BC, Sulla was elected for his first consulship and his first assignment was to defeat <!--del_lnk--> Mithridates of Pontus, whose intentions were to conquer the Eastern part of the Roman territories. However, Marius's partisans managed his installation to the military command, defying Sulla and the <!--del_lnk--> Senate, and this caused Sulla's wrath. To consolidate his own power, Sulla conducted a surprising and illegal action: <!--del_lnk--> he marched to Rome with his legions, killing all those who showed support to Marius's cause and impaling their heads in the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Forum. In the following year, 87 BC, Marius, who had fled at Sulla's march, came back to Rome while Sulla was campaigning in Greece. He seized power along with the consul <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Cornelius Cinna and killed the other consul, <!--del_lnk--> Gnaeus Octavius, achieving to his seventh consulship. In an attempt to raise Sulla's anger, Marius and Cinna revenged their partisans conducting a massacre (<!--del_lnk--> Marian Massacre) and having impaled the heads of Sulla's supporters (as earlier <!--del_lnk--> Publius Sulpicius Rufus was impaled similarly by Sulla on the <!--del_lnk--> rostra).</p>
       <p>Marius died in 86 BC, due to his age and poor health, just a few months after seizing power. Cinna exercised absolute power until his death in 84 BC. Sulla after returning from his Eastern campaigns, had a free path to reestablish his own power. In 83 BC he made his <!--del_lnk--> second march in Rome and started a more sanguinary time of terror: thousands of nobles, knights and senators were executed. Sulla also held two dictatorships and one more consulship, which established the crisis and decline of Roman Republic.</p>

       <p>In the mid-1st century BC, the city of Rome was in a restless period. After Marius's fall, the populace was lacking populist leaders and the men who were enriched at Sulla's time, urged for a new absolute leader who would delegate power and opportunities to them. The latter group supported the <!--del_lnk--> Catilinarian conspiracy &ndash; a resounding failure, since the consul <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Tullius Cicero quickly arrested and executed the main leaders of the conspiracy.</p>
       <p>At this time the strife between <i><!--del_lnk--> populares</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> optimates</i> increased, and they each wanted a strong new man to lead the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic &ndash; with some internal oppositions to this in the <i><!--del_lnk--> optimates</i> party, namely Cicero and <!--del_lnk--> Cato the Younger.</p>
       <p>Into this turbulent scenario emerged the figure of the very popular politician, <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Gaius Julius Caesar</a>. Caesar became the symbol of Ancient Rome, and his name became synonymous with glory, geniality, boldness, and power. Caesar, having a familial bond with Marius (<!--del_lnk--> his aunt Julia was Marius' wife), rebuilt the Marian party, which had been humiliated and drastically reduced after Sulla's terms in office, and was able to count upon its support. To achieve power, Caesar reconciled the two more powerful men in Rome: <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Licinius Crassus, his sponsor, and Crassus' rival, <!--del_lnk--> Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (often anglicized as Pompey, to whom he married <!--del_lnk--> his daughter). This new alliance, the <!--del_lnk--> First Triumvirate ("three men"), had satisfied the interests of these three men: Crassus, the richest man in Rome, became richer; Pompey exerted more influence in the Senate; and Caesar held consulship and military command in <!--del_lnk--> Gaul.</p>
       <p>In 54 BC, Caesar's daughter, Pompey's wife, died in childbirth, unraveling one link in the alliance. In 53 BC, the Triumvirate disintegrated at Crassus' death. Crassus had acted as mediator between Caesar and Pompey, and, without him, the two generals began to fight for power. After being victorious in several battles in the <!--del_lnk--> Gallic Wars and earning respect and praise from the legions, Caesar was a clear menace to Pompey. Confident that Caesar could be stopped by legal means, Pompey tried to remove Caesar's legions. Caesar resisted because Pompey would gain absolute power. To avoid this, Caesar <!--del_lnk--> crossed the Rubicon River and invaded Rome in 49 BC.</p>
       <p>Caesar pursued Pompey and destroyed all of the <i>optimates</i> leaders: <!--del_lnk--> Metellus Scipio, <!--del_lnk--> Cato the Younger, and Pompey's son, <!--del_lnk--> Gnaeus Pompeius. Pompey was murdered in Egypt in 48 BC, after his escape from Rome during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Pharsalus, which was a brilliant victory for Caesar. With his sole preeminence over Rome, in the years between the crossing of the Rubicon and his assassination, Caesar was granted many offices. Before a term had ended, Caesar was granted another one. In just five years, he held four consulships, two ordinary dictatorships, and two special dictatorships: one for ten years and another for perpetuity. He was murdered in 44 BC, in the <!--del_lnk--> Ides of March by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Liberatores</i>.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Caesar's assassination caused political and social turmoil in Rome; without the dictator's leadership, the city was ruled by his friend and colleague, <a href="../../wp/m/Mark_Antony.htm" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a>. Soon afterward, <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Octavius</a>, whom Caesar adopted through his will, arrived in Rome. Octavian (historians regard Octavius as Octavian due to the <!--del_lnk--> Roman naming conventions) tried to align himself with the Caesarian faction. In 43 BC, along with Antony and <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Caesar's best friend, he legally established the <!--del_lnk--> Second Triumvirate. This alliance would last for five years. Upon its formation, 130&ndash;300 senators were executed, and their property was confiscated, due to their supposed support for the <i><!--del_lnk--> Liberatores</i>.</p>
       <p>In 42 BC, the Senate deified Caesar as <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Divus Iulius">Divus Iulius</a></i>, (note that <i>Divus</i> means "deified", and not "god". The Latin word for god is <i>Deus</i>; this word is used for real deities as <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter_%2528mythology%2529.htm" title="Jupiter (mythology)">Jupiter</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a>. However, a <i>Divus</i> is not a deity, but a remarkable person who was as important to Rome as <!--del_lnk--> Romulus was.) Octavian thus became <i><!--del_lnk--> Divi filius</i>, the son of the deified. In the same year, Octavian and Antony defeated both Caesar's assassins and the leaders of the <i>Liberatores</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Junius Brutus and <!--del_lnk--> Gaius Cassius Longinus, in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Philippi.</p>
       <p>The Second Triumvirate was marked by the proscriptions of many senators and <i>equites</i>: after a revolt led by Antony's brother <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Antonius more than 300 senators and <i>equites</i> involved were executed on the anniversary of the <!--del_lnk--> Ides of March, although Lucius was spared. The Triumvirate proscribed several important men, including <!--del_lnk--> Cicero, whom Antony hated; <!--del_lnk--> Quintus Tullius Cicero, the younger brother of the orator; and, more shockingly, <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Julius Caesar, cousin and friend of the acclaimed general, for his support of Cicero. However, Lucius was pardoned, perhaps because his sister Julia had intervened for him.</p>
       <p>The Triumvirate divided the Empire among the triumvirs: Lepidus was left in charge of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa_%2528Roman_province%2529.htm" title="Africa (Roman province)">Africa</a>, Antony, the eastern provinces, and Octavian remained in Italy and controlled <!--del_lnk--> Hispania and <!--del_lnk--> Gaul.</p>
       <p>The Second Triumvirate expired in 38 BC but was renewed for more five years. However, the relationship between Octavian and Antony had deteriorated, and Lepidus was forced to retire in 36 BC after betraying Octavian in <!--del_lnk--> Sicily. By the end of the Triumvirate, Antony was living in Egypt, an independent and rich kingdom ruled by Antony's lover, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cleopatra.htm" title="Cleopatra VII">Cleopatra VII</a>. Antony's affair with Cleopatra was seen as an act of treason, since she was queen of another country and Antony was adopting an extravagant and Hellenistic lifestyle that was considered inappropriate for a Roman statesman.</p>
       <p>Following Antony's <!--del_lnk--> Donations of Alexandria, which gave to Cleopatra the title of "Queen of Kings", and to Antony's and Cleopatra's children the regal titles to the newly conquered Eastern territories, <!--del_lnk--> the war between Octavian and Antony broke out. Octavian annihilated Egyptian forces in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide. Now Egypt was conquered by the Roman Empire, and for the Romans, a new era had begun.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Empire">Empire</span></h3>
       <p>In 27 BC, Octavian was the sole Roman leader. His leadership brought the <!--del_lnk--> zenith of the Roman civilization, that lasted for two centuries. In that year, he took the name <i><!--del_lnk--> Augustus</i>. That event is usually taken by historians as the beginning of Roman Empire &ndash; although Rome was an "imperial" state since 146 BC, when Carthage was razed by <!--del_lnk--> Scipio Aemilianus and Greece was conquered by <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Mummius. Officially, the government was republican, but Augustus assumed absolute powers. Besides that, the Empire was safer, happier and more glorious than the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Julio-Claudian_dynasty">Julio-Claudian dynasty</span></h4>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Julio-Claudian dynasty was established by Augustus. The emperors of this dynasty were: <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Augustus</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Tiberius, <!--del_lnk--> Caligula, <a href="../../wp/c/Claudius.htm" title="Claudius">Claudius</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Nero. The dynasty is so-called due to the <i><!--del_lnk--> gens Julia</i>, family of Augustus, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> gens Claudia</i>, family of Tiberius. The Julio-Claudians started the destruction of republican values, but on the other hand, they boosted Rome's status as the central power in the world.</p>
       <p>While Caligula and Nero are usually remembered as mad or mean emperors in popular culture, Augustus and Claudius were great emperors in politics and military. This dynasty instituted imperial tradition in Rome and frustrated any attempt to reestablish Republic.</p>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Augustus">Augustus</span></h5>
       <p><a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Augustus</a> gathered almost all the republican powers under his official title, <i><!--del_lnk--> princeps</i>: he had powers of consul, <i><!--del_lnk--> princeps senatus</i>, <!--del_lnk--> aedile, <!--del_lnk--> censor and <!--del_lnk--> tribune &ndash; including tribunician sacrosanctity. This was the base of an emperor's power. Augustus also styled himself as <i><!--del_lnk--> Imperator Gaius Julius Caesar divi filius</i>, "Commander Gaius Julius Caesar, son of the deified one". With this title he not only boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, but the use of <i>Imperator</i> signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory.</p>
       <p>He also diminished the <!--del_lnk--> Senatorial class influence in politics by boosting the <!--del_lnk--> equestrian class. The senators lost their right to rule certain provinces, like Egypt; since the governor of that province was directly nominated by the emperor. The creation of the <!--del_lnk--> Praetorian Guard and his reforms in military, setting the number of legions in 28, ensured his total control over the army.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Compared with Second Triumvirate&rsquo;s epoch, Augustus' reign as <i>princeps</i> was very peaceful. This peace and richness (that was granted by the agrarian province of Egypt) led people and nobles of Rome to support Augustus and increased his strength in political affairs.</p>
       <p>In military activity, Augustus was absent at battles. His generals were responsible for the field command; gaining much respect from the populace and the legions, such as <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, <!--del_lnk--> Nero Claudius Drusus and <!--del_lnk--> Germanicus. Augustus intended to extend the Roman Empire to the whole known world, and in his reign, Rome had conquered <!--del_lnk--> Cantabria <!--del_lnk--> Aquitania, <!--del_lnk--> Raetia, <!--del_lnk--> Dalmatia, <!--del_lnk--> Illyricum and <!--del_lnk--> Pannonia.</p>
       <p>Under Augustus's reign, Roman literature grew steadily in the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age of Latin Literature. Poets like <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/v/Virgil.htm" title="Vergil">Vergil</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Horace, <!--del_lnk--> Ovid and <!--del_lnk--> Rufus developed a rich literature, and were close friends of Augustus. Along with <!--del_lnk--> Maecenas, he stimulated patriotic poems, as Vergil's epic <i><!--del_lnk--> Aeneid</i> and also historiographical works, like those of <!--del_lnk--> Livy. The works of this literary age lasted through Roman times, and are classics.</p>
       <p>Augustus also continued the shifts on the calendar promoted by <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Caesar</a>, and the month of August is named after him. Augustus brought a peaceful and thriving era to Rome, that is known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Pax Augusta</i> or <i>Pax Romana</i>. Augustus died in 14 AD, but the empire&rsquo;s glory continued after his era.</p>

       <p>The Julio-Claudians continued to rule Rome after Augustus' death and they remained in power until the death of Nero in 68 AD. Augustus' favorites for succeeding him were already dead in his senescence: his nephew <!--del_lnk--> Marcellus died in 23 BC, his friend and military commander <!--del_lnk--> Agrippa in 12 BC and his grandson <!--del_lnk--> Gaius Caesar in 4 AD. Influenced by his wife, <!--del_lnk--> Livia Drusilla, Augustus appointed <!--del_lnk--> Tiberius, her son from another marriage, as his heir.</p>
       <p>The Senate agreed with the succession, and granted to Tiberius the same titles and honours once granted to Augustus: the title of <i>princeps</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Pater patriae</i>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Civic Crown. However, Tiberius was not an enthusiast of political affairs: after agreement with the Senate, he retired to <!--del_lnk--> Capri in 26 AD, and left control of the city of Rome in the hands of the <!--del_lnk--> praetorian prefect <!--del_lnk--> Sejanus (until 31 AD) and <!--del_lnk--> Macro (from 31 to 37 AD). Tiberius was regarded as an evil and melancholic man, who may have ordered the murder of his relatives, the popular general <!--del_lnk--> Germanicus in 19 AD, and his own son <!--del_lnk--> Drusus Julius Caesar in 23 AD.</p>
       <p>Tiberius died (or was killed) in 37 AD. The male line of the Julio-Claudians was limited to Tiberius' nephew <a href="../../wp/c/Claudius.htm" title="Claudius">Claudius</a>, his grandson <!--del_lnk--> Tiberius Gemellus and his grand-nephew <!--del_lnk--> Caligula. As Gemellus was still a child, Caligula was chosen to rule the Empire. Being a popular leader in the first half of his reign, Caligula became a crude and insane tyrant in his years controlling government. <!--del_lnk--> Suetonius states that he committed <!--del_lnk--> incest with his sisters, killed some men just for amusement and nominated <!--del_lnk--> a horse for a consulship.</p>
       <p>The Praetorian Guard murdered Caligula four years after the death of Tiberius, and, with belated support from the senators, proclaimed his uncle <a href="../../wp/c/Claudius.htm" title="Claudius">Claudius</a> as the new emperor. Claudius was not as authoritarian as Tiberius and Caligula. Claudius conquered <!--del_lnk--> Lycia and <!--del_lnk--> Thrace; his most important deed was the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> conquest of Britain.</p>
       <p>Claudius was poisoned by his wife, <!--del_lnk--> Agrippina the Younger in 54 AD. His heir was <!--del_lnk--> Nero, son of Agrippina and her former husband, since Claudius' son, <!--del_lnk--> Britannicus, had not reached manhood upon his father's death. Nero is widely known as the first persecutor of Christians and for the <!--del_lnk--> Great Fire of Rome, started by the emperor himself. Nero faced many revolts during his reign, like the <!--del_lnk--> Pisonian conspiracy and the <!--del_lnk--> First Jewish-Roman War. Although Nero defeated these rebels, he could not overthrow the revolt led by <!--del_lnk--> Servius Sulpicius Galba. The Senate soon declared Nero a public enemy, and he committed suicide.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Flavian_dynasty">Flavian dynasty</span></h4>
       <p>The Flavians were the second dynasty to rule Rome. In 68 AD, year of Nero's death, there was no chance of return to the old and traditional <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic, thus a new emperor had to rise. After the turmoil in the <!--del_lnk--> Year of the Four Emperors, <!--del_lnk--> Titus Flavius Vespasianus (anglicized as Vespasian) took control of the Empire and established a new dynasty.

       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Vespasian">Vespasian</span></h5>
       <p>Vespasian was a great general under <a href="../../wp/c/Claudius.htm" title="Claudius">Claudius</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Nero.

       <p>Titus died of fever in 81 AD, being succeeded by his brother <!--del_lnk--> Domitian.

       <p>Titus constructed a line of roads and fortifications on the borders of modern-day Germany; and his general <!--del_lnk--> Gnaeus Julius Agricola conquered much of Britain, leading the Roman world so far as Scotland. On the other hand, his failed <!--del_lnk--> war against Dacia was a humiliating defeat.</p>
       <p>Domitian ruled for fifteen years, and his reign was marked by his attempts to compare himself to the gods. He constructed at least two temples in honour of Jupiter, the greatest deity in <!--del_lnk--> Roman religion. He also liked to be called "<i>Dominus et Deus</i>" ("Master and God"). The nobles disliked his rule, and he was murdered by a conspiracy involving his own wife, <!--del_lnk--> Domitia Longina, in 96 AD.</p>

       <p>During the rule of the Nerva&ndash;Antonine, Rome reached its territorial and economical apogee. This time was a peaceful one for Rome: the criteria for choosing an emperor were the qualities of the candidate and no longer ties of kinship; additionally there were no civil wars or military defeats in that time.</p>
       <p>Following Domitian's murder, the Senate rapidly appointed <!--del_lnk--> Nerva to hold imperial dignity &ndash; this was the first time that senators chose the emperor since Octavian was honored with the titles of <i><!--del_lnk--> princeps</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Augustus</i>. Nerva had a noble ancestry, and he served as an advisor to <!--del_lnk--> Nero and the Flavians. His rule restored many of the liberties once taken by Domitian and started the last golden era of Rome.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Nerva died in 98 AD and the successor was his heir, the general <!--del_lnk--> Trajan. Trajan was born in a non-patrician family from <!--del_lnk--> Hispania and his preeminence emerged in the army, under Domitian. He is the second of the <!--del_lnk--> Five Good Emperors, the first being Nerva.</p>
       <p>Trajan was greeted by the people of Rome with great enthusiasm, which he justified by governing well and without the bloodiness that had marked Domitian's reign. He freed many people who had been unjustly imprisoned by Domitian and returned a great deal of private property that Domitian had confiscated; a process begun by Nerva before his death.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Trajan conquered Dacia, and defeated the king <!--del_lnk--> Decebalus, who had defeated Domitian's forces. In the <!--del_lnk--> First Dacian War (101&ndash;102), the defeated <!--del_lnk--> Dacia became a client kingdom; in the <!--del_lnk--> Second Dacian War (105&ndash;106), Trajan completely devastated the enemy's resistance and annexed Dacia to the Empire. Trajan also annexed the client state of <!--del_lnk--> Nabatea to form the province of <!--del_lnk--> Arabia Petraea, which included the lands of southern Syria and northwestern Arabia.</p>
       <p>He erected many buildings that still survive to this day, such as <!--del_lnk--> Trajan's Forum, <!--del_lnk--> Trajan's Market and <!--del_lnk--> Trajan's Column. His main architect was <!--del_lnk--> Apollodorus of Damascus; Apollodorus made the project of the Forum and of the Column, and also reformed the <!--del_lnk--> Pantheon. Trajan's triumphal arches in <!--del_lnk--> Ancona and <!--del_lnk--> Beneventum are other constructions projected by him. In Dacian War, Apollodorus made a <!--del_lnk--> great bridge over the Danube for Trajan.</p>
       <p>Trajan's final war was against <!--del_lnk--> Parthia. When Parthia appointed a king for <!--del_lnk--> Armenia who was unacceptable (Parthia and Rome shared dominance over Armenia) to Rome, he declared war. He probably wanted to be the first Roman leader to conquer Parthia, and repeat the glory of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, conqueror of Asia, whom Trajan next followed in the clash of Greek-Romans and the Persian cultures. In 113 he marched to Armenia and deposed the local king. In 115 Trajan turned south into the core of Parthian hegemony, taking the Northern Mesopotamian cities of <!--del_lnk--> Nisibis and <!--del_lnk--> Batnae and organizing a province of <!--del_lnk--> Mesopotamia in the beginning of 116, when coins were issued announcing that Armenia and Mesopotamia had been put under the authority of the Roman people.</p>
       <p>In that same year, he captured <!--del_lnk--> Seleucia and the Parthian capital <!--del_lnk--> Ctesiphon. After defeating a Parthian revolt and a Jewish revolt, he withdrew due to health issues. In 117, his illness grew and he died of <a href="../../wp/e/Edema.htm" title="Edema">edema</a>. He nominated <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian as his heir. Under Trajan's leadership the Roman Empire reached the peak of its territorial expansion; Rome's dominion now spanned 2.5&nbsp;million square miles (6.5&nbsp;million&nbsp;km&sup2;).</p>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="From_Hadrian_to_Commodus">From Hadrian to Commodus</span></h5>
       <p>The prosperity brought by <!--del_lnk--> Nerva and <!--del_lnk--> Trajan continued in the reigns of subsequent emperors, from <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian to <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Aurelius. Hadrian withdrew all the troops stationed in Parthia and Mesopotamia, abandoning Trajan's conquests. Hadrian's government was very peaceful, since he avoided wars: he constructed fortifications and walls, like the famous <a href="../../wp/h/Hadrian%2527s_Wall.htm" title="Hadrian's Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a> between <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman Britain</a> and the barbarians of modern-day Scotland.</p>
       <p>A famous <!--del_lnk--> philhellenist, he promoted culture, specially the Greek culture. He also forbade <!--del_lnk--> torture and humanized the laws. Hadrian built many aqueducts, baths, libraries and theaters; additionally, he traveled nearly every single province in the Empire to check the military and infrastructural conditions.</p>
       <p>After Hadrian's death at 138, his successor <!--del_lnk--> Antoninus Pius built temples, theaters, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of <!--del_lnk--> rhetoric and philosophy. Antoninus made few initial changes when he became emperor, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Hadrian. Antoninus expanded the Roman Britain by invading southern Scotland and building the <!--del_lnk--> Antonine Wall. He also continued Hadrian's policy of humanizing the laws. He died in 161 AD.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Marcus Aurelius, known as the Philosopher, was the last of the <!--del_lnk--> Five Good Emperors. He was a stoic philosopher and wrote a book called <i><!--del_lnk--> Meditations</i>. He defeated barbarian tribes in the <!--del_lnk--> Marcomannic Wars as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Parthian Empire. His co-emperor, <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Verus died in 169 AD, probably victim of the <!--del_lnk--> Antonine Plague, a pandemic that swept nearly five million people through the Empire in 165&ndash;180 AD.</p>
       <p>From Nerva to Marcus Aurelius, the empire achieved an unprecedented happy and glorious status. The powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. All the citizens enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence. The Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government. The <!--del_lnk--> Five Good Emperors&rsquo; rule is considered the greatest era of the Empire.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Commodus, son of Marcus Aurelius, became emperor after his father's death. He is not counted in the <!--del_lnk--> Five Good Emperors group. Firstly, because he had direct kinship with the latter emperor; in addition, he was not like his predecessors in personality and acts. Commodus usually took part on gladiatorial combats &ndash; a symbol of brutality and roughness , since a gladiator was always a slave -, and was a cruel, lewd and narcissistic man. He killed many citizens and his reign is the beginning of Roman <!--del_lnk--> decadence, as stated <!--del_lnk--> Cassius Dio: "(Rome has transformed) from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust".</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Severan_dynasty">Severan dynasty</span></h4>
       <p>Commodus was killed by a conspiracy involving <!--del_lnk--> Quintus Aemilius Laetus and his wife Marcia in late 192 AD. The following year is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Year of the Five Emperors. <!--del_lnk--> Pertinax, <!--del_lnk--> Didius Julianus, <!--del_lnk--> Pescennius Niger, <!--del_lnk--> Clodius Albinus and <!--del_lnk--> Septimius Severus fought for the imperial dignity. After many battles against the other generals, Severus established himself as the new emperor. He and his successors governed with the legions' support &ndash; and they paid money for this support. The changes on <a href="../../wp/c/Coin.htm" title="Coin">coinage</a> and military expenditures were the root of the financial crisis that marked the <!--del_lnk--> Crisis of the 3rd century.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Severus was enthroned after invading Rome and having <!--del_lnk--> Didius Julianus killed. His two other rivals, <!--del_lnk--> Pescennius Niger and <!--del_lnk--> Clodius Albinus, were both were hailed as <i>Imperator</i>. Severus quickly subdued Niger in <!--del_lnk--> Byzantium and promised to Albinus the title of Caesar (which meant he would be a co-emperor). However, Severus betrayed Albinus by blaming him on a plot against his life. Severus marched to <!--del_lnk--> Gaul and defeated Albinus. For these acts, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Niccol%25C3%25B2_Machiavelli.htm" title="Machiavelli">Machiavelli</a> said that Severus was "a ferocious lion and a clever fox"</p>
       <p>Severus attempted to revive totalitarianism and in an address to people and the Senate, he praised the severity and cruelty of Marius and Sulla, which worried the senators. When <!--del_lnk--> Parthia invaded Roman territory, Severus waged war against that country. He seized the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Nisibis, <!--del_lnk--> Babylon and <!--del_lnk--> Seleucia. Reaching <!--del_lnk--> Ctesiphon, the Parthian capital, he ordered a great plunder and his army slew and captured many people. Albeit this military success, he failed in invading <!--del_lnk--> Hatra, a rich Arabian city. Severus killed his legate, for the latter was gaining respect from the legions; and his soldiers were hit by famine. After this disastrous campaign, he withdrew.</p>
       <p>Severus also intended to vanquish the whole of <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Britain</a>. In order to achieve this, he waged war against the <!--del_lnk--> Caledonians. After many casualties in the army due to the terrain and the barbarians' ambushes, Severus went himself to the field. However, he became ill and died in 211 AD.</p>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="From_Caracalla_to_Alexander_Severus">From Caracalla to Alexander Severus</span></h5>
       <p>Upon the death of Severus, his sons <!--del_lnk--> Caracalla and <!--del_lnk--> Geta were made emperors. Caracalla got rid of his brother in that same year. Like his father, Caracalla was a warlike man. He continued Severus' policy, and gained respect from the legions. Caracalla was a cruel man, and ordered several slayings during his reign. He ordered the death of people of his own circle, like his tutor, Cilo, and a friend of his father, <!--del_lnk--> Papinian.</p>
       <p>Knowing that the citizens of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexandria.htm" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> disliked him and were speaking ill of his character, he slew almost the entire population of the city. Arriving there, he served a banquet for the notable citizens. After that, his soldiers killed all the guests, and he marched into the city with the army, slaying most of Alexandria's people. In 212, he issued the <!--del_lnk--> Edict of Caracalla, giving full Roman citizenship to all free men living in the Empire. Caracalla was murdered by one of his soldiers during a campaign in <!--del_lnk--> Parthia, in 217 AD.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Praetorian prefect <!--del_lnk--> Macrinus, who ordered Caracalla's murder, assumed power. His brief reign ended in 218, when the youngster <a href="../../wp/e/Elagabalus.htm" title="Elagabalus">Elagabalus</a>, a relative of the Severi, gained support from the legionaries and fought against Macrinus. Elagabalus was an incompetent and lascivious ruler, who was well known for extreme extravagance. <!--del_lnk--> Cassius Dio, <!--del_lnk--> Herodian and the <!--del_lnk--> Historia Augusta have many accounts about his extravagance.</p>
       <p>Elagabalus was succeeded by his cousin <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Severus. Alexander waged war against many foes, like the revitalized <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Persia">Persia</a> and German peoples who invaded <!--del_lnk--> Gaul. His losses made the soldiers dissatisfied with the emperor, and some of them killed him during his German campaign, in 235 AD.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>A disastrous scenario emerged after the death of <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Severus: the Roman state was plagued by civil wars, external <a href="../../wp/i/Invasion.htm" title="Invasion">invasions</a>, political chaos, <!--del_lnk--> pandemics and <!--del_lnk--> economic depression. The old Roman values had fallen, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mithraic_mysteries.htm" title="Mithraism">Mithraism</a> and Christianity had begun to spread through the populace. Emperors were no longer men linked with nobility; they usually were born in lower-classes of distant parts of the Empire. These men rose to prominence through military ranks, and became emperors through civil wars.</p>
       <p>There were 26 emperors in a 49-year period, a signal of political instability. <!--del_lnk--> Maximinus Thrax was the first ruler of that time, governing for just three years. Others ruled just for a few months, like <!--del_lnk--> Gordian I, <!--del_lnk--> Gordian II, <!--del_lnk--> Balbinus and <!--del_lnk--> Hostilian. The population and the frontiers were abandoned, since the emperors were mostly concerned with defeating rivals and establishing their power.</p>
       <p>The economy also suffered during that epoch. The massive military expenditures from the <!--del_lnk--> Severi caused a devaluation of Roman coins. <!--del_lnk--> Hyperinflation came at this time as well. The <!--del_lnk--> Plague of Cyprian broke out in 250 and killed a huge portion of the population.</p>
       <p>In 260 AD, the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Syria Palaestina, <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor and <!--del_lnk--> Egypt separated from the rest of the Roman state to form the <!--del_lnk--> Palmyrene Empire, ruled by Queen <!--del_lnk--> Zenobia and centered on <!--del_lnk--> Palmyra. In that same year the <!--del_lnk--> Gallic Empire was created by <!--del_lnk--> Postumus, retaining <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Britain</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Gaul. These countries separated from Rome after the capture of emperor <!--del_lnk--> Valerian, who was the first Roman ruler to be captured by enemies; Valerian was captured and executed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sassanid_Empire.htm" title="Sassanid">Sassanids</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Persia">Persia</a> &ndash; a humiliating fact for the Romans.</p>
       <p>The crisis began to recede during the reigns of <!--del_lnk--> Claudius Gothicus (268&ndash;270), who defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Goths invaders, and <!--del_lnk--> Aurelian (271&ndash;275), who reconquered both Gallic and Palmyrene Empire During the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Diocletian, a more competent ruler, the crisis was overcome.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Dominate">Dominate</span></h4>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Diocletian">Diocletian</span></h5>
       <p>In 284 AD, Diocletian was hailed as Imperator by the eastern legions. Diocletian healed the empire from the crisis, by political and economic shifts. A new form of government was established: the <!--del_lnk--> Tetrarchy. The Empire was divided among four emperors, two in the West and two in the East. The first tetrarchs were Diocletian (in the East), <!--del_lnk--> Maximian (in the West), and two junior emperors, <!--del_lnk--> Galerius (in the East) and <!--del_lnk--> Flavius Constantius (in the West). To adjust the economy, Diocletian made several tax reforms.</p>
       <p>Diocletian expelled the Persians who plundered <!--del_lnk--> Syria and conquered some barbarian tribes with Maximian. He adopted many behaviors of Eastern monarchs, like wearing pearls and golden sandals and robes. Anyone in presence of the emperor had now to prostrate himself &ndash; a common act in the East, but never practiced in Rome before. Diocletian did not use a disguised form of Republic, as the other emperors since <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Augustus</a> had done.</p>
       <p>Diocletian was also responsible for a significant Christian persecution. In 303 he and <!--del_lnk--> Galerius started the persecution and ordered the destruction of all the Christian churches and scripts and forbade Christian worship.</p>
       <p>Diocletian abdicated in 305 AD together with <!--del_lnk--> Maximian, thus, he was the first Roman emperor to resign. His reign ended the traditional form of imperial rule, the <!--del_lnk--> Principate (from <!--del_lnk--> princeps) and started the <!--del_lnk--> Dominate (from Dominus, &ldquo;Master&rdquo;)</p>
       <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Constantine_and_the_Christianity">Constantine and the Christianity</span></h5>
       <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Constantine_the_Great.htm" title="Constantine I">Constantine</a> assumed the empire as a tetrarch in 306. He conducted many wars against the other tetrarchs. Firstly he defeated <!--del_lnk--> Maxentius in 312. In 313, he issued the <!--del_lnk--> Edict of Milan, which granted liberty for Christians to profess their religion. Constantine was converted to Christianity, enforcing the Christian faith. Therefore, he began the Christianization of the Empire and of Europe &ndash; a process concluded by the Catholic Church in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Alamanni were defeated by him during 306&ndash;308. In 324 he defeated another tetrarch, <!--del_lnk--> Licinius, and controlled all the empire, as it was before <!--del_lnk--> Diocletian. To celebrate his victories and Christianity&rsquo;s relevance, he rebuilt <!--del_lnk--> Byzantium and renamed it Nova Roma (&ldquo;New Rome&rdquo;); but the city soon gained the informal name of <a href="../../wp/c/Constantinople.htm" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> (&ldquo;City of Constantine&rdquo;). The city served as a new capital for the Empire. In fact, Rome had lost its central importance since the <!--del_lnk--> Crisis of the 3rd century &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Mediolanum was the capital from 286 to 330, and continued to hold the imperial court of West until the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Honorius, when <!--del_lnk--> Ravenna was made capital, in the 5th century.</p>
       <p>Constantine&rsquo;s administrative and monetary reforms, reuniting the Empire under one emperor, and rebuilding the city of Byzantium changed the high period of the <!--del_lnk--> ancient world.</p>

       <p>After <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Constantine_the_Great.htm" title="Constantine I">Constantine</a>&rsquo;s rule, the empire&rsquo;s deterioration became more evident and entered into a critical stage. Christian values, which were centered in a heaven in an afterlife, were responsible for making Romans less warlike and not so willing to risk their lives for the country &ndash; in total opposition to the <!--del_lnk--> old and traditional Roman values. This anti-bellicosity forced the Army to accept barbarian mercenaries in its lines.</p>
       <p>Under the last of the Constantinian dynasty and early Valentinian dynasty, Rome lost many decisive battles against the <a href="../../wp/s/Sassanid_Empire.htm" title="Sassanid Empire">Persians</a> and Germanic barbarians: in 363, emperor <!--del_lnk--> Julian the Apostate was killed in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Samarra, against the Persians and the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Adrianople resulted in a decisive victory for the <!--del_lnk--> Goths and cost the life of emperor <!--del_lnk--> Valens (364&ndash;378). <!--del_lnk--> Theodosius (379&ndash;395) gave even more force to the Christian faith; after his death, the Empire was divided into the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Eastern Roman Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>, ruled by <!--del_lnk--> Arcadius and the <a href="../../wp/w/Western_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Western Roman Empire">Western Roman Empire</a>, commanded by <!--del_lnk--> Honorius; both were Theodosius&rsquo; sons.</p>
       <p>The situation became more critical in 408, after the death of <!--del_lnk--> Stilicho, a general who impeded a larger barbarian invasion in the early years of the 5th century. In 410, the Theodosian dynasty saw the <!--del_lnk--> Visigoths <!--del_lnk--> sack Rome. During the 5th century, the Western Empire saw a significant reduction of its territory. The <!--del_lnk--> Vandals conquered North Africa, the <!--del_lnk--> Visigoths claimed <!--del_lnk--> Gaul, <!--del_lnk--> Hispania was taken by the <!--del_lnk--> Suebi, <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Britain</a> was abandoned by the central government, and the Empire almost collapsed during the invasions of <a href="../../wp/a/Attila.htm" title="Attila">Attila</a>, chieftain of the <!--del_lnk--> Huns.</p>
       <p>Fatally, general <!--del_lnk--> Orestes refused to have the barbarian &ldquo;allies&rdquo; serving the army, and tried to expel them from Italy. Unhappy with this resolution, the chieftain <!--del_lnk--> Odoacer, from the <!--del_lnk--> Heruli, defeated and killed Orestes, invaded <!--del_lnk--> Ravenna and dethroned <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Romulus_Augustulus.htm" title="Romulus Augustus">Romulus Augustus</a>, son of Orestes. This event happened in 476, and historians usually take it as the mark of the end of <!--del_lnk--> Classical Antiquity and beginning of the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.</p>
       <p>Having lasted for about 1200 years, the rule of Rome in the West ended. The Eastern Empire had a different fate. It survived for almost 1000 years after the fall of its <a href="../../wp/w/Western_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Western Roman Empire">Western counterpart</a> and became the most stable Christian <!--del_lnk--> realm during the Middle Ages. During the 6th century, <!--del_lnk--> Justinian briefly reconquered <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">Northern Africa</a> and Italy, but Byzantine possessions in the West were reduced to <!--del_lnk--> southern Italy and <!--del_lnk--> Sicily within a few years after Justinian's death. In the east, partially resulting from the destructive <!--del_lnk--> Plague of Justinian, the Byzantines were threatened by the rise of Islam, whose followers rapidly <!--del_lnk--> conquered the territories of Syria, <!--del_lnk--> Armenia and <!--del_lnk--> Egypt during the <!--del_lnk--> Byzantine-Arab Wars, and soon presented a direct <!--del_lnk--> threat to Constantinople. In the following century, the Arabs also <!--del_lnk--> captured southern Italy and Sicily.</p>
       <p>The Byzantines, however, managed to stop further Islamic expansion into their lands during the 8th century and, beginning in the 9th century, reclaimed parts of the conquered lands. In 1000 AD, the Eastern Empire was at its height: <!--del_lnk--> Basileios&nbsp;II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia, culture and trade flourished. However, soon after the expansion was abruptly stopped in 1071 with their defeat in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Manzikert. The aftermath of this important battle sent the empire into a protracted period of decline. Two decades of internal strife and <!--del_lnk--> Turkic invasions ultimately paved the way for Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Alexius&nbsp;I Comnenus to send a call for help to the Western Europe kingdoms in 1095.</p>
       <p>The West responded with the <a href="../../wp/c/Crusades.htm" title="Crusades">Crusades</a>, eventually resulting in the <!--del_lnk--> Sack of Constantinople by participants in the <!--del_lnk--> Fourth Crusade. The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 fragmented what remained of the Empire into successor states, the ultimate victor being that of <!--del_lnk--> Nicaea. After the recapture of Constantinople by Imperial forces, the Empire was little more than a Greek state confined to the <!--del_lnk--> Aegean coast. The Eastern Empire collapsed when <!--del_lnk--> Mehmed&nbsp;II conquered Constantinople on 29 May,&nbsp;1453.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Historians">Historians</span></h3>
       <p>Rome has a very rich history, which was explored by many authors, both ancient and modern. The first history works were written after the <!--del_lnk--> First Punic War. Many of these works were made for propaganda of the Roman culture and customs, and also as moral essays. Although the diversity of works, many of them are lost and due to this, there are large gaps in Roman history, which are filled by unreliable works, as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Historia Augusta</i> and books from obscure authors. However, there remain a number of accounts of Roman History.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="In_Roman_times">In Roman times</span></h4>
       <p>There is a huge variety of historians who lived in Roman times and wrote on Rome. The first historians used their works for lauding of Roman culture and customs. By the end of Republic, some historians distorted their histories to flatter their patrons &ndash; this happened on the time of <!--del_lnk--> Marius' and <!--del_lnk--> Sulla's clash. <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Caesar</a> wrote his own histories to make a complete account of his military campaigns in <!--del_lnk--> Gaul and in the <!--del_lnk--> Civil War.</p>
       <p>In the Empire, the biographies of famous men and early emperors flourished, examples being <i><!--del_lnk--> The Twelve Caesars</i> of Suetonius, and Plutarch's <i><!--del_lnk--> Parallel Lives</i>. Other major works of Imperial times were that of Livy and Tacitus.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The imperial city of Rome was the largest urban centre of its time, with a population of about one million people (about the size of London in the early 19th century, when London was the largest city in the world), with some high-end estimates of 14 million and low-end estimates of 450,000. The public spaces in Rome resounded with such a din of hooves and clatter of iron <!--del_lnk--> chariot wheels that <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> had once proposed a ban on chariot traffic during the day. Historical estimates show that around 20 percent of the population under jurisdiction of ancient Rome (25&ndash;40%, depending on the standards used, in Roman Italy) lived in innumerable urban centers, with population of 10,000 and more and several <!--del_lnk--> military settlements, a very high rate of urbanization by pre-industrial standards. Most of these centers had a <!--del_lnk--> forum, temples, and other buildings similar to those in Rome.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Class_structure">Class structure</span></h3>
       <p>Roman society is largely viewed as <!--del_lnk--> hierarchical, with <!--del_lnk--> slaves (<i>servi</i>) at the bottom, <!--del_lnk--> freedmen (<i>liberti</i>) above them, and free-born citizens (<i>cives</i>) at the top. Free citizens were also divided by class. The broadest, and earliest, division was between the <!--del_lnk--> patricians, who could trace their ancestry to one of the 100 <!--del_lnk--> Patriarchs at the founding of the city, and the <!--del_lnk--> plebeians, who could not. This became less important in the later Republic, as some plebeian families became wealthy and entered politics, and some patrician families fell on hard times. Anyone, patrician or plebeian, who could count a consul as his ancestor was a <!--del_lnk--> noble (<i>nobilis</i>); a man who was the first of his family to hold the consulship, such as <!--del_lnk--> Marius or <!--del_lnk--> Cicero, was known as a <i><!--del_lnk--> novus homo</i> ("new man") and ennobled his descendants. Patrician ancestry, however, still conferred considerable prestige, and many religious offices remained restricted to patricians.</p>
       <p>A class division originally based on military service became more important. Membership of these classes was determined periodically by the <!--del_lnk--> Censors, according to property. The wealthiest were the Senatorial class, who dominated politics and command of the army. Next came the <!--del_lnk--> equestrians (<i>equites</i>, sometimes translated "knights"), originally those who could afford a warhorse, who formed a powerful mercantile class. Several further classes, originally based on what military equipment their members could afford, followed, with the <i>proletarii</i>, citizens who had no property at all, at the bottom. Before the reforms of Marius they were ineligible for military service and are often described as being just above freed slaves in wealth and prestige.</p>
       <p>Voting power in the Republic was dependent on class. Citizens were enrolled in voting "tribes", but the tribes of the richer classes had fewer members than the poorer ones, all the <i>proletarii</i> being enrolled in a single tribe. Voting was done in class order and stopped as soon as most of the tribes had been reached, so the poorer classes were often unable even to cast their votes.</p>
       <p>Women shared some basic rights with their male counterparts, but were not fully regarded as citizens and were thus not allowed to vote or take part in politics. At the same time the limited rights of women gradually were expanded (due to <!--del_lnk--> emancipation) and women reached freedom from <i>paterfamilias</i>, gained property rights and even had more juridical rights than their husbands, but still they had no voting rights and were absent from politics.</p>
       <p>Allied foreign cities were often given the <!--del_lnk--> Latin Right, an intermediary level between full citizens and foreigners (<i>peregrini</i>), which gave their citizens rights under <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_law.htm" title="Roman law">Roman law</a> and allowed their leading magistrates to become full Roman citizens. While there were varying degrees of Latin rights, the main division was between those <i>cum suffragio</i> ("with vote"; enrolled in a <!--del_lnk--> Roman tribe and able to take part in the <i>comitia tributa</i>) and <i>sine suffragio</i> ("without vote"; could not take part in Roman politics). Some of Rome's Italian allies were given full citizenship after the <!--del_lnk--> Social War of 91&ndash;88 BC, and full <!--del_lnk--> Roman citizenship was extended to all free-born men in the Empire by <!--del_lnk--> Caracalla in 212.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The basic units of Roman society were households and <a href="../../wp/f/Family.htm" title="Family">families</a>. Households included the head (usually the father) of the household, <i><!--del_lnk--> pater familias</i> (father of the family), his wife, children, and other relatives. In the upper classes, slaves and servants were also part of the household. The head of the household had great power (<i>patria potestas</i>, "father's power") over those living with him: He could force marriage (usually for money) and divorce, sell his children into slavery, claim his dependents' property as his own, and even had the right to punish or kill family members (though this last right apparently ceased to be exercised after the 1st century BC).</p>
       <p><i>Patria potestas</i> even extended over adult sons with their own households: A man was not considered a <i>paterfamilias</i>, nor could he truly hold property, while his own father lived. During the early period of Rome's history, a daughter, when she married, fell under the control (<i>manus</i>) of the <i>paterfamilias</i> of her husband's household, although by the late Republic this fell out of fashion, as a woman could choose to continue recognizing her father's family as her true family. However, as Romans reckoned <!--del_lnk--> descent through the male line, any children she had belonged to her husband's family.</p>
       <p>Little affection was shown for the children of Rome. The mother or an elderly relative often raised both boys and girls, and unwanted children were often sold as slaves. Children might have waited on tables for the family, but they could not have participated in the conversation. A Greek nurse usually taught the children Latin and Greek; the father, the boys how to swim and ride, although he sometimes hired a slave to teach them instead. At seven, a boy began his education. Having no school building, classes were held on a rooftop (if dark, the boy had to carry a lantern to school). Wax-covered boards were used because paper, papyrus, and parchment were too expensive&mdash;or he could just write in the sand. A loaf of bread to be eaten was also carried. Of course, rich boys had their materials carried by a slave.</p>
       <p>Groups of related households formed a family (<i><!--del_lnk--> gens</i>). Families were based on blood ties or <!--del_lnk--> adoption, but were also political and economic alliances. Especially during the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic, some powerful families, or <i><!--del_lnk--> Gentes Maiores</i>, came to dominate political life.</p>
       <p>In ancient Rome, marriage was often regarded more as a financial and political alliance than as a romantic association, especially in the upper classes (see <!--del_lnk--> marriage in ancient Rome). Fathers usually began seeking husbands for their daughters when these reached an age between twelve and fourteen. The husband was usually older than the bride. While upper class girls married very young, there is evidence that lower class women often married in their late teens or early 20s.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h3>
       <p>In the early Republic, there were no public schools, so boys were taught to read and write by their parents, or by educated <!--del_lnk--> slaves, called <i><!--del_lnk--> paedagogi</i>, usually of Greek origin. The primary aim of education during this period was to train young men in agriculture, warfare, <!--del_lnk--> Roman traditions, and public affairs. Young boys learned much about civic life by accompanying their fathers to religious and political functions, including the Senate for the sons of nobles. The sons of nobles were apprenticed to a prominent <!--del_lnk--> political figure at the age of 16, and campaigned with the army from the age of 17 (this system was still in use among some noble families into the imperial era).</p>
       <p>Educational practices were modified after the conquest of the Hellenistic kingdoms in the 3rd century BC and the resulting Greek influence, although it should be noted that Roman educational practices were still much different from Greek ones. If their parents could afford it, boys and some girls at the age of 7 were sent to a private school outside the home called a <i><!--del_lnk--> ludus</i>, where a teacher (called a <i>litterator</i> or a <!--del_lnk--> <i>magister ludi</i>, and often of Greek origin) taught them basic reading, writing, arithmetic, and sometimes Greek, until the age of 11.</p>
       <p>Beginning at age 12, students went to secondary schools, where the teacher (now called a <i>grammaticus</i>) taught them about <!--del_lnk--> Greek and <!--del_lnk--> Roman literature. At the age of 16, some students went on to <!--del_lnk--> rhetoric school (where the teacher, usually Greek, was called a <i><!--del_lnk--> rhetor</i>). Education at this level prepared students for legal careers, and required that the students memorize the laws of Rome. Pupils went to school every day, except religious festivals and market days. There were also summer holidays.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Government">Government</span></h3>
       <p>Initially, Rome was ruled by <!--del_lnk--> kings, who were elected from each of Rome's major tribes in turn. The exact nature of the king's power is uncertain. He may have held near-absolute power, or may also have merely been the chief executive of the <!--del_lnk--> Senate and the people. At least in military matters, the king's authority (<i><!--del_lnk--> Imperium</i>) was likely absolute. He was also the head of the <!--del_lnk--> state religion. In addition to the authority of the King, there were three administrative assemblies: the <!--del_lnk--> Senate, which acted as an advisory body for the King; the <!--del_lnk--> Comitia Curiata, which could endorse and ratify laws suggested by the King; and the <!--del_lnk--> Comitia Calata, which was an assembly of the priestly college that could assemble the people to bear witness to certain acts, hear proclamations, and declare the <!--del_lnk--> feast and holiday schedule for the next month.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> class struggles of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic resulted in an unusual mixture of democracy and <a href="../../wp/o/Oligarchy.htm" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a>. The word republic comes from the Latin <i>res publica</i>, which literally translates to "public business". <!--del_lnk--> Roman laws traditionally could only be passed by a vote of the Popular assembly (<!--del_lnk--> Comitia Tributa). Likewise, candidates for public positions had to run for election by the people. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Senate represented an oligarchic institution, which acted as an advisory body.</p>
       <p>In the Republic, the Senate held great authority (<i>auctoritas</i>), but no real legislative power; it was technically only an advisory council. However, as the Senators were individually very influential, it was difficult to accomplish anything against the collective will of the Senate. New Senators were chosen from among the most accomplished <!--del_lnk--> patricians by <!--del_lnk--> Censors (<i>Censura</i>), who could also remove a Senator from his office if he was found "morally corrupt"; a charge that could include bribery or, as under <!--del_lnk--> Cato the Elder, embracing one's wife in public. Later, under the reforms of the dictator <!--del_lnk--> Sulla, <!--del_lnk--> Quaestors were made automatic members of the Senate, though most of his reforms did not survive.</p>
       <p>The Republic had no fixed <!--del_lnk--> bureaucracy, and collected taxes through the practice of <!--del_lnk--> tax farming. Government positions such as <!--del_lnk--> quaestor, <!--del_lnk--> aedile, or <!--del_lnk--> praefect were funded from the office-holder's private finances. To prevent any citizen from gaining too much power, new <!--del_lnk--> magistrates were elected annually and had to share power with a colleague. For example, under normal conditions, the highest authority was held by two consuls. In an emergency, a temporary <!--del_lnk--> dictator could be appointed. Throughout the Republic, the administrative system was revised several times to comply with new demands. In the end, it proved inefficient for controlling the ever-expanding dominion of Rome, contributing to the establishment of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>.</p>
       <p>In the early Empire, the pretense of a republican form of government was maintained. The <!--del_lnk--> Roman Emperor was portrayed as only a <i><!--del_lnk--> princeps</i>, or "first citizen", and the Senate gained legislative power and all legal authority previously held by the popular assemblies. However, the rule of the Emperors became increasingly <a href="../../wp/a/Autocracy.htm" title="Autocracy">autocratic</a>, and the Senate was reduced to an advisory body appointed by the Emperor. The Empire did not inherit a set bureaucracy from the Republic, since the Republic did not have any permanent governmental structures apart from the Senate. The Emperor appointed assistants and advisers, but the state lacked many institutions, such as a centrally planned <!--del_lnk--> budget. Some historians have cited this as a significant reason for the <!--del_lnk--> decline of the Roman Empire.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3>
       <p>The roots of the legal principles and practices of the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Romans may be traced to the <!--del_lnk--> Law of the Twelve Tables promulgated in 449 BC and to the codification of law issued by order of Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Justinian I around 530 AD (see <!--del_lnk--> Corpus Juris Civilis). Roman law as preserved in Justinian's codes continued into the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, and formed the basis of similar codifications in continental Western Europe. Roman law continued, in a broader sense, to be applied throughout most of Europe until the end of the 17th century.</p>
       <p>The major divisions of the law of ancient Rome, as contained within the Justinian and Theodosian law codes, consisted of <i>Ius Civile</i>, <i>Ius Gentium</i>, and <i>Ius Naturale</i>. The <i>Ius Civile</i> ("Citizen Law") was the body of common laws that applied to Roman citizens. The <!--del_lnk--> <i>Praetores Urbani</i> (<i>sg. Praetor Urbanus</i>) were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens. The <i>Ius Gentium</i> ("Law of nations") was the body of common laws that applied to foreigners, and their dealings with Roman citizens. The <!--del_lnk--> <i>Praetores Peregrini</i> (<i>sg. Praetor Peregrinus</i>) were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens and foreigners. <i>Ius Naturale</i> encompassed natural law, the body of laws that were considered common to all beings.</p>

       <p>Ancient Rome commanded a vast area of land, with tremendous natural and human resources. As such, Rome's economy remained focused on <!--del_lnk--> farming and trade. Agricultural <!--del_lnk--> free trade changed the Italian landscape, and by the 1st century BC, vast grape and <!--del_lnk--> olive estates had supplanted the <!--del_lnk--> yeoman farmers, who were unable to match the imported grain price. The <!--del_lnk--> annexation of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, Sicily and <a href="../../wp/t/Tunisia.htm" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> in North Africa provided a continuous supply of grains. In turn, <a href="../../wp/o/Olive_oil.htm" title="Olive oil">olive oil</a> and <!--del_lnk--> wine were Italy's main exports. Two-tier <!--del_lnk--> crop rotation was practiced, but farm productivity was low, around 1 ton per hectare.</p>
       <p>Industrial and <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> activities were smaller. The largest such activities were the mining and <!--del_lnk--> quarrying of stones, which provided basic construction materials for the buildings of that period. In manufacturing, production was on a relatively small scale, and generally consisted of workshops and small factories that employed at most dozens of workers. However, some brick factories employed hundreds of workers.</p>
       <p>The economy of the early Republic was largely based on smallholding and paid labor. However, foreign wars and conquests made <!--del_lnk--> slaves increasingly cheap and plentiful, and by the late Republic, the economy was largely dependent on <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slave labor</a> for both skilled and unskilled work. Slaves are estimated to have constituted around 20% of the Roman Empire's population at this time and 40% in the city of Rome. Only in the Roman Empire, when the conquests stopped and the prices of slaves increased, did hired labor become more economical than slave ownership.</p>
       <p>Although <!--del_lnk--> barter was used in ancient Rome, and often used in tax collection, Rome had a very developed <a href="../../wp/c/Coin.htm" title="Coin">coinage</a> system, with <a href="../../wp/b/Brass_instrument.htm" title="Brass instrument">brass</a>, <!--del_lnk--> bronze, and <!--del_lnk--> precious metal coins in circulation throughout the Empire and beyond&mdash;some have even been discovered in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. Before the 3rd century BC, copper was traded by weight, measured in unmarked lumps, across <!--del_lnk--> central Italy. The original <!--del_lnk--> copper coins (<i><!--del_lnk--> as</i>) had a face value of one <!--del_lnk--> Roman pound of copper, but weighed less. Thus, Roman money's utility as a unit of exchange consistently exceeded its <!--del_lnk--> intrinsic value as metal. After <!--del_lnk--> Nero began debasing the silver <!--del_lnk--> denarius, its <!--del_lnk--> legal value was an estimated one-third greater than its intrinsic value.</p>
       <p>Horses were too expensive and other <!--del_lnk--> pack animals too slow. Mass trade on the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_roads.htm" title="Roman roads">Roman roads</a> connected military posts, not markets, and were rarely designed for wheels. As a result, there was little transport of <!--del_lnk--> commodities between Roman regions until the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Roman maritime trade in the 2nd century BC. During that period, a trading vessel took less than a month to complete a trip from <!--del_lnk--> Gades to <a href="../../wp/a/Alexandria.htm" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> via <!--del_lnk--> Ostia, spanning the entire length of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a>. Transport by sea was around 60 times cheaper than by land, so the volume for such trips was much larger.</p>
       <p>Some economists like <!--del_lnk--> Peter Temin consider the Roman Empire a <!--del_lnk--> market economy, similar in its degree of capitalistic practices to 17th century Netherlands and 18th century England.</p>

       <p>The early Roman army (c. 500 BC) was, like those of other contemporary <!--del_lnk--> city-states influenced by Greek civilization, a citizen <i><!--del_lnk--> militia</i> that practiced <!--del_lnk--> hoplite tactics. It was small (the population of free men of military age was then about 9,000) and organized in five classes (in parallel to the <i><!--del_lnk--> comitia centuriata</i>, the body of citizens organized politically), with three providing hoplites and two providing light infantry. The early Roman army was tactically limited and its stance during this period was essentially defensive.</p>
       <p>By the 3rd century BC, the Romans abandoned the hoplite formation in favour of a more flexible system in which smaller groups of 120 (or sometimes 60) men called <i><!--del_lnk--> maniples</i> could maneuver more independently on the battlefield. Thirty maniples arranged in three lines with supporting troops constituted a <!--del_lnk--> legion, totaling between 4,000 and 5,000 men.</p>
       <p>The early Republican legion consisted of five sections, each of which was equipped differently and had different places in formation: the three lines of manipular heavy infantry (<i><!--del_lnk--> hastati</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> principes</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> triarii)</i>, a force of light infantry (<i><!--del_lnk--> velites</i>), and the cavalry (<i><!--del_lnk--> equites</i>). With the new organization came a new orientation toward the offensive and a much more aggressive posture toward adjoining city-states.</p>
       <p>At nominal full strength, an early Republican legion included 4,000 to 5,000 men: 3,600 to 4,800 heavy infantry, several hundred light infantry, and several hundred cavalrymen. Legions were often significantly understrength from recruitment failures or following periods of active service due to accidents, battle casualties, disease and desertion. During the Civil War, Pompey's legions in the east were at full strength because they were recently recruited, while Caesar's legions were often well below nominal strength after long active service in Gaul. This pattern also held true for auxiliary forces.</p>
       <p>Until the late Republican period, the typical legionary was a property-owning citizen farmer from a rural area (an <i>adsiduus</i>) who served for particular (often annual) campaigns, and who supplied his own equipment and, in the case of <i>equites</i>, his own mount. Harris suggests that down to 200 BC, the average rural farmer (who survived) might participate in six or seven campaigns. Freedmen and slaves (wherever resident) and urban citizens did not serve except in rare emergencies.</p>
       <p>After 200 BC, economic conditions in rural areas deteriorated as manpower needs increased, so that the property qualifications for service were gradually reduced. Beginning with <!--del_lnk--> Gaius Marius in 107 BC, citizens without property and some urban-dwelling citizens (<i>proletarii</i>) were enlisted and provided with equipment, although most legionaries continued to come from rural areas. Terms of service became continuous and long&mdash;up to twenty years if emergencies required it although Brunt argues that six- or seven-year terms were more typical.</p>
       <p>Beginning in the 3rd century BC, legionaries were paid <i>stipendium</i> (amounts are disputed but Caesar famously "doubled" payments to his troops to 225 <!--del_lnk--> <i>denarii</i> a year), could anticipate booty and donatives (distributions of plunder by commanders) from successful campaigns and, beginning at the time of Marius, often were granted allotments of land upon retirement. Cavalry and light infantry attached to a legion (the <i>auxilia</i>) were often recruited in the areas where the legion served. Caesar formed a legion, the Fifth Alaudae, from non-citizens in Transalpine Gaul to serve in his campaigns in Gaul. By the time of Caesar Augustus, the ideal of the citizen-soldier had been abandoned and the legions had become fully professional. Legionaries received 900 <!--del_lnk--> <i>sesterces</i> a year and could expect 12,000 <i>sesterces</i> on retirement.</p>
       <p>At the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Civil War, Augustus reorganized Roman military forces, discharging soldiers and disbanding legions. He retained 28 legions, distributed through the provinces of the Empire. During the <!--del_lnk--> Principate, the tactical organization of the Army continued to evolve. The <i>auxilia</i> remained independent cohorts, and legionary troops often operated as groups of cohorts rather than as full legions. A new versatile type of unit &nbsp;- the <i>cohortes equitatae</i> &ndash; combined cavalry and legionaries in a single formation. They could be stationed at garrisons or outposts and could fight on their own as balanced small forces or combine with other similar units as a larger legion-sized force. This increase in organizational flexibility helped ensure the long-term success of Roman military forces.</p>
       <p>The Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Gallienus (253&ndash;268 AD) began a reorganization that created the last military structure of the late Empire. Withdrawing some legionaries from the fixed bases on the border, Gallienus created mobile forces (the <i><!--del_lnk--> Comitatenses</i> or field armies) and stationed them behind and at some distance from the borders as a strategic reserve. The border troops (<i>limitanei</i>) stationed at fixed bases continued to be the first line of defense. The basic unit of the field army was the "regiment", <i>legiones</i> or <i>auxilia</i> for infantry and <i>vexellationes</i> for cavalry. Evidence suggests that nominal strengths may have been 1,200 men for infantry regiments and 600 for cavalry, although many records show lower actual troop levels (800 and 400).</p>
       <p>Many infantry and cavalry regiments operated in pairs under the command of a <i><!--del_lnk--> comes</i>. In addition to Roman troops, the field armies included regiments of "barbarians" recruited from allied tribes and known as <i><!--del_lnk--> foederati</i>. By 400 AD, <i>foederati</i> regiments had become permanently established units of the Roman army, paid and equipped by the Empire, led by a Roman tribune and used just as Roman units were used. In addition to the <i>foederati</i>, the Empire also used groups of barbarians to fight along with the legions as "allies" without integration into the field armies. Under the command of the senior Roman general present, they were led at lower levels by their own officers.</p>
       <div class="thumb tright">
       </div>
       <p>Military leadership evolved greatly over the course of the history of Rome. Under the monarchy, the hoplite armies were led by the kings of Rome. During the early and middle Roman Republic, military forces were under the command of one of the two elected <!--del_lnk--> consuls for the year. During the later Republic, members of the Roman Senatorial elite, as part of the normal sequence of elected public offices known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> cursus honorum</i>, would have served first as <i><!--del_lnk--> quaestor</i> (often posted as deputies to field commanders), then as <!--del_lnk--> <i>praetor</i>.</p>
       <p>Following the end of a term as praetor or consul, a Senator might be appointed by the Senate as a <!--del_lnk--> <i>propraetor</i> or <!--del_lnk--> <i>proconsul</i> (depending on the highest office held before) to govern a foreign province. More junior officers (down to but not including the level of centurion) were selected by their commanders from their own <i><!--del_lnk--> clientelae</i> or those recommended by political allies among the Senatorial elite.</p>
       <p>Under Augustus, whose most important political priority was to place the military under a permanent and unitary command, the Emperor was the legal commander of each legion but exercised that command through a <!--del_lnk--> <i>legatus</i> (legate) he appointed from the Senatorial elite. In a province with a single legion, the legate commanded the legion (<i><!--del_lnk--> legatus legionis</i>) and also served as provincial governor, while in a province with more than one legion, each legion was commanded by a legate and the legates were commanded by the provincial governor (also a legate but of higher rank).</p>
       <p>During the later stages of the Imperial period (beginning perhaps with <!--del_lnk--> Diocletian), the Augustan model was abandoned. Provincial governors were stripped of military authority, and command of the armies in a group of provinces was given to generals (<!--del_lnk--> <i>duces</i>) appointed by the Emperor. These were no longer members of the Roman elite but men who came up through the ranks and had seen much practical soldiering. With increasing frequency, these men attempted (sometimes successfully) to usurp the positions of the Emperors who had appointed them. Decreased resources, increasing political chaos and civil war eventually left the Western Empire vulnerable to attack and takeover by neighboring barbarian peoples.</p>
       <p>Less is known about the <!--del_lnk--> Roman navy than the Roman army. Prior to the middle of the 3rd century BC, officials known as <i>duumviri navales</i> commanded a fleet of twenty ships used mainly to control piracy. This fleet was given up in 278 AD and replaced by allied forces. The <!--del_lnk--> First Punic War required that Rome build large fleets, and it did so largely with the assistance of and financing from allies. This reliance on allies continued to the end of the Roman Republic. The <!--del_lnk--> quinquereme was the main warship on both sides of the Punic Wars and remained the mainstay of Roman naval forces until replaced by the time of Caesar Augustus by lighter and more maneuverable vessels.</p>
       <p>As compared with a <!--del_lnk--> trireme, the quinquereme permitted the use of a mix of experienced and inexperienced crewmen (an advantage for a primarily land-based power), and its lesser maneuverability permitted the Romans to adopt and perfect <!--del_lnk--> boarding tactics using a troop of about 40 marines in lieu of the <!--del_lnk--> ram. Ships were commanded by a <!--del_lnk--> <i>navarch</i>, a rank equal to a centurion, who was usually not a citizen. Potter suggests that because the fleet was dominated by non-Romans, the navy was considered non-Roman and allowed to atrophy in times of peace.</p>
       <p>Information suggests that by the time of the late Empire (350 AD), the Roman navy comprised several fleets including warships and merchant vessels for transportation and supply. Warships were oared sailing galleys with three to five banks of oarsmen. Fleet bases included such ports as Ravenna, Arles, Aquilea, Misenum and the mouth of the Somme River in the West and Alexandria and Rhodes in the East. Flotillas of small river craft (<i>classes</i>) were part of the <i>limitanei</i> (border troops) during this period, based at fortified river harbors along the Rhine and the Danube. That prominent generals commanded both armies and fleets suggests that naval forces were treated as auxiliaries to the army and not as an independent service. The details of command structure and fleet strengths during this period are not well known, although fleets were commanded by prefects.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Life in ancient Rome revolved around the city of Rome, located on <!--del_lnk--> seven hills. The city had a vast number of <!--del_lnk--> monumental structures like the <a href="../../wp/c/Colosseum.htm" title="Colosseum">Colosseum</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Forum of Trajan and the <!--del_lnk--> Pantheon. It had <!--del_lnk--> theatres, <!--del_lnk--> gymnasiums, marketplaces, functional sewers, <a href="../../wp/t/Thermae.htm" title="Thermae">bath complexes</a> complete with libraries and shops, and fountains with fresh drinking water supplied by hundreds of miles of <!--del_lnk--> aqueducts. Throughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential architecture ranged from modest houses to <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_villa.htm" title="Roman villa">country villas</a>.</p>
       <p>In the capital city of Rome, there were <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">imperial</a> <a href="../../wp/h/House.htm" title="House">residences</a> on the elegant <!--del_lnk--> Palatine Hill, from which the word <i>palace</i> derives. The low <!--del_lnk--> Plebian and middle <!--del_lnk--> Equestrian classes lived in the city centre, packed into apartments, or <!--del_lnk--> Insulae, which were almost like modern <!--del_lnk--> ghettos. These areas, often built by upper class property owners to rent, were often centred upon <!--del_lnk--> collegia or <!--del_lnk--> taberna. These people, provided with a <!--del_lnk--> free supply of grain, and entertained by <!--del_lnk--> gladatorial games, were enrolled as <!--del_lnk--> clients of patrons among the upper class <!--del_lnk--> Patricians, whose assistance they sought and whose interests they upheld.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Language">Language</span></h3>
       <p>The native <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a> of the Romans was <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, an <!--del_lnk--> Italic language the <!--del_lnk--> grammar of which relies little on word order, conveying meaning through a system of <!--del_lnk--> affixes attached to <!--del_lnk--> word stems. Its <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_alphabet.htm" title="Latin alphabet">alphabet</a> was based on the <!--del_lnk--> Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn based on the <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_alphabet.htm" title="Greek alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>. Although surviving <!--del_lnk--> Latin literature consists almost entirely of <!--del_lnk--> Classical Latin, an artificial and highly stylized and polished <!--del_lnk--> literary language from the 1st century BC, the <!--del_lnk--> spoken language of the Roman Empire was <a href="../../wp/v/Vulgar_Latin.htm" title="Vulgar Latin">Vulgar Latin</a>, which significantly differed from Classical Latin in <!--del_lnk--> grammar and <!--del_lnk--> vocabulary, and eventually in pronunciation.</p>
       <p>While <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> remained the main written language of the Roman Empire, <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a> came to be the language spoken by the well-educated elite, as most of the literature studied by Romans was written in Greek. In the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which later became the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, Latin was never able to replace Greek, and after the death of Justinian, Greek became the official language of the Byzantine government. The expansion of the Roman Empire spread Latin throughout Europe, and Vulgar Latin evolved into <!--del_lnk--> dialects in different locations, gradually shifting into many distinct <!--del_lnk--> Romance languages.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion">Religion</span></h3>
       <p>Archaic <!--del_lnk--> Roman religion, at least concerning the gods, was made up not of written <!--del_lnk--> narratives, but rather of complex interrelations between gods and humans. Unlike in <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the gods were not personified, but were vaguely defined sacred spirits called <i><!--del_lnk--> numina</i>. Romans also believed that every person, place or thing had its own <i><!--del_lnk--> genius</i>, or divine soul. During the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic, <!--del_lnk--> Roman religion was organized under a strict system of priestly offices, which were held by men of senatorial rank. The College of Pontifices was uppermost body in this hierarchy, and its chief priest, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Pontifex Maximus</i>, was the head of the state religion. <!--del_lnk--> Flamens took care of the cults of various gods, while <!--del_lnk--> augurs were trusted with taking the <!--del_lnk--> auspices. The <!--del_lnk--> sacred king took on the religious responsibilities of the deposed kings. In the Roman Empire, emperors were deified, and the formalized <!--del_lnk--> imperial cult became increasingly prominent.</p>
       <p>As contact with the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a> increased, the old <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_mythology.htm" title="Roman mythology">Roman gods</a> became increasingly associated with <!--del_lnk--> Greek gods. Thus, <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter_%2528mythology%2529.htm" title="Jupiter (mythology)">Jupiter</a> was perceived to be the same deity as <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mars became associated with <!--del_lnk--> Ares, and <!--del_lnk--> Neptune with <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon. The Roman gods also assumed the attributes and mythologies of these Greek gods. Under the Empire, the Romans absorbed the mythologies of their conquered subjects, often leading to situations in which the temples and priests of traditional Italian deities existed side by side with those of foreign gods.</p>
       <p>Beginning with Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Nero in the 1st century AD, Roman official policy towards Christianity was negative, and at some points, simply being a Christian could be punishable by death. Under Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Diocletian, the <!--del_lnk--> persecution of Christians reached its peak. However, it became an officially supported religion in the Roman state under Diocletian's successor, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Constantine_the_Great.htm" title="Constantine I">Constantine I</a>, with the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Edict of Milan in 313, and quickly became dominant. All religions except Christianity were prohibited in 391 AD by an edict of Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Theodosius I.</p>

       <p>Roman painting styles show <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> influences, and surviving examples are primarily <!--del_lnk--> frescoes used to adorn the walls and ceilings of country <!--del_lnk--> villas, though <!--del_lnk--> Roman literature includes mentions of paintings on wood, <a href="../../wp/i/Ivory.htm" title="Ivory">ivory</a>, and other materials. Several examples of Roman painting have been found at <a href="../../wp/p/Pompeii.htm" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>, and from these <!--del_lnk--> art historians divide the history of Roman painting into four periods. The first style of Roman painting was practiced from the early 2nd century BC to the early- or mid-1st century BC. It was mainly composed of imitations of <!--del_lnk--> marble and <!--del_lnk--> masonry, though sometimes including depictions of mythological characters.</p>
       <p>The second style of Roman painting began during the early 1st century BC, and attempted to depict realistically three-dimensional architectural features and landscapes. The third style occurred during the reign of <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Augustus</a> (27 BC&nbsp;&ndash; 14 AD), and rejected the <!--del_lnk--> realism of the second style in favor of simple ornamentation. A small architectural scene, landscape, or abstract design was placed in the centre with a <!--del_lnk--> monochrome background. The fourth style, which began in the 1st century AD, depicted scenes from mythology, while retaining architectural details and abstract patterns.</p>
       <p>Portrait sculpture during the period utilized youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and <!--del_lnk--> idealism. During the <!--del_lnk--> Antonine and <!--del_lnk--> Severan periods, ornate hair and bearding, with deep cutting and drilling, became popular. Advancements were also made in <!--del_lnk--> relief sculptures, usually depicting Roman victories.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Latin literature was, from its start, influenced heavily by Greek authors. Some of the earliest extant works are of historical <!--del_lnk--> epics telling the early military history of Rome. As the Republic expanded, authors began to produce poetry, comedy, history, and <!--del_lnk--> tragedy.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Roman music was largely based on <!--del_lnk--> Greek music, and played an important part in many aspects of Roman life. In the <!--del_lnk--> Roman military, musical instruments such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> tuba</i> (a long trumpet) or the <i>cornu</i> (similar to a <a href="../../wp/h/Horn_%2528instrument%2529.htm" title="Horn (instrument)">French horn</a>) were used to give various commands, while the <i>bucina</i> (possibly a trumpet or <a href="../../wp/h/Horn_%2528instrument%2529.htm" title="Horn (instrument)">horn</a>) and the <i>lituus</i> (probably an elongated J-shaped instrument), were used in ceremonial capacities. Music was used in the <!--del_lnk--> amphitheaters between fights and in the <i><!--del_lnk--> odea</i>, and in these settings is known to have featured the <i>cornu</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> hydraulis</i> (a type of water organ).</p>
       <p>Most religious rituals featured musical performances, with <i>tibiae</i> (double pipes) at sacrifices, <a href="../../wp/c/Cymbal.htm" title="Cymbal">cymbals</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Tambourines at <!--del_lnk--> orgiastic <!--del_lnk--> cults, and <!--del_lnk--> rattles and <!--del_lnk--> hymns across the spectrum. Some music historians believe that music was used at almost all public ceremonies. Music historians are not certain if Roman musicians made a significant contribution to the <!--del_lnk--> theory or practice of music.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> graffiti, <!--del_lnk--> brothels, paintings, and sculptures found in <a href="../../wp/p/Pompeii.htm" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Herculaneum suggest that the Romans had a sex-saturated culture.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scholarly_studies">Scholarly studies</span></h3>
       <p>Interest in studying ancient Rome arose during the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> in France. <!--del_lnk--> Charles Montesquieu wrote a work <i>Reflections on the Causes of the Grandeur and Declension of the Romans</i>. The first major work was <i><!--del_lnk--> The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> by <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_Gibbon.htm" title="Edward Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>, which encompassed the period from the end of 2nd century to the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. Like Montesquieu, Gibbon paid high tribute to the virtue of Roman citizens. <!--del_lnk--> Barthold Georg Niebuhr was a founder of the examination of ancient Roman history and wrote <i>The Roman History</i>, tracing the period until the <!--del_lnk--> First Punic war. Niebuhr tried to determine the way the Roman tradition evolved. According to him, Romans, like other people, had an historical <!--del_lnk--> ethos preserved mainly in the noble families.</p>
       <p>During the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Napoleon.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleonic</a> period a work titled <i>The History of Romans</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Victor Duruy appeared. It highlighted the <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Caesarean</a> period popular at the time. <i><!--del_lnk--> History of Rome</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Roman constitutional law</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</i>, all by <!--del_lnk--> Theodor Mommsen, became very important milestones. Later the work <i>Greatness and Decline of Rome</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Guglielmo Ferrero was published. The Russian work <i>&#x41E;&#x447;&#x435;&#x440;&#x43A;&#x438; &#x43F;&#x43E; &#x438;&#x441;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x438;&#x438; &#x440;&#x438;&#x43C;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E; &#x437;&#x435;&#x43C;&#x43B;&#x435;&#x432;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x434;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x44F;, &#x43F;&#x440;&#x435;&#x438;&#x43C;&#x443;&#x449;&#x435;&#x441;&#x442;&#x432;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x43E; &#x432; &#x44D;&#x43F;&#x43E;&#x445;&#x443; &#x418;&#x43C;&#x43F;&#x435;&#x440;&#x438;&#x438;</i> (<i>The Outlines on Roman Landownership History, Mainly During the Empire</i>) by Ivan Grevs contained information on the economy of <!--del_lnk--> Pomponius Atticus, one of the greatest landowners during the end of the Republic.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cuisine">Cuisine</span></h3>
       <p>Ancient Roman cuisine changed over the long duration of this ancient civilization. Dietary habits were affected by the influence of Greek culture, the political changes from kingdom to republic to empire, and empire's enormous expansion, which exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. In the beginning the differences between social classes were not very great, but disparities developed with the empire's growth.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Games_and_activities">Games and activities</span></h3>
       <p>The youth of Rome had several forms of play and exercise, such as <!--del_lnk--> jumping, <a href="../../wp/w/Wrestling.htm" title="Wrestling">wrestling</a>, <!--del_lnk--> boxing, and <!--del_lnk--> racing. In the countryside, pastimes for the wealthy also included fishing and hunting. The Romans also had several forms of ball playing, including one resembling <!--del_lnk--> handball. <!--del_lnk--> Dice games, <a href="../../wp/b/Board_game.htm" title="Board game">board games</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> gamble games were popular pastimes. Women did not take part in these activities. For the wealthy, dinner parties presented an opportunity for entertainment, sometimes featuring music, dancing, and poetry readings. <!--del_lnk--> Plebeians sometimes enjoyed similar parties through clubs or associations, although recreational dining usually meant patronizing <!--del_lnk--> taverns. Children entertained themselves with toys and such games as <!--del_lnk--> leapfrog.</p>
       <p>A popular form of entertainment was <!--del_lnk--> gladiatorial combats. Gladiators fought either to the death or to "first blood" with a variety of weapons in different scenarios. These fights achieved their height of popularity under the emperor <a href="../../wp/c/Claudius.htm" title="Claudius">Claudius</a>, who placed the outcome of the combat firmly in the hands of the Emperor with a hand gesture. Contrary to popular representations in film, several experts believe the gesture for death was not "thumbs down". Although no one is certain about what the gestures were, some experts conclude that the emperor signaled "death" by holding a raised fist to the winning combatant and then extending his thumb upwards, while "mercy" was indicated by a raised fist with no extended thumb. Animal shows were also popular with the Romans, where foreign animals were either displayed for the public or combined with gladiatorial combat. A prisoner or gladiator, armed or unarmed, was thrown into the arena and an animal was released.</p>
       <p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Circus Maximus</i>, another popular site in Rome, was primarily used for <!--del_lnk--> horse and <!--del_lnk--> chariot racing, and when the Circus was flooded, there could be sea battles. It was also used for many other events. The Circus could hold up to 385,000 people; people all over Rome would visit it. Two temples, one with seven large eggs and one with seven dolphins, lay in the middle of the track of Circus Maximus, and when the racers made a lap, one of each would be removed. This was done to keep the spectators and the racers informed of the race statistics.</p>
       <p>Other than for sports, the Circus Maximus was also an area of marketing and gambling. Higher authorities, such as the Emperor, also attended games in the Circus Maximus, as it was considered rude to avoid attendance. The higher authorities, knights, and many other people who were involved with the race, sat in reserved seats located above everyone else. It was also considered inappropriate for emperors to favour a team. The Circus Maximus was created in 600 BC and hosted the last horse-racing game in 549 AD, after a custom enduring over a millennium.</p>

       <p>Ancient Rome boasted impressive technological feats, using many advancements that were lost in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> and not rivaled again until the 19th and 20th centuries. An example of this is <!--del_lnk--> Insulated glazing, which was not invented again until the 1930s. Many practical Roman innovations were adopted from earlier Greek designs. Advancements were often divided and based on craft. <!--del_lnk--> Artisans guarded technologies as <!--del_lnk--> trade secrets.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Roman civil engineering and <!--del_lnk--> military engineering constituted a large part of Rome's technological superiority and legacy, and contributed to the construction of hundreds of roads, bridges, <!--del_lnk--> aqueducts, <!--del_lnk--> baths, theaters and <!--del_lnk--> arenas. Many monuments, such as the <a href="../../wp/c/Colosseum.htm" title="Colosseum">Colosseum</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Pont du Gard, and <!--del_lnk--> Pantheon, remain as testaments to Roman engineering and culture.</p>
       <p>The Romans were renowned for their <!--del_lnk--> architecture, which is grouped with Greek traditions into "<!--del_lnk--> Classical architecture". Although there were many differences from <!--del_lnk--> Greek architecture, Rome borrowed heavily from Greece in adhering to strict, formulaic building designs and proportions. Aside from two new <!--del_lnk--> orders of columns, <!--del_lnk--> composite and <!--del_lnk--> Tuscan, and from the <!--del_lnk--> dome, which was derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Etruscan <!--del_lnk--> arch, Rome had relatively few architectural innovations until the end of the Republic.</p>

       <p>In the 1st century BC, Romans started to use concrete, widely. Concrete was invented in the late 3rd century BC. It was a powerful cement derived from <!--del_lnk--> pozzolana, and soon supplanted <!--del_lnk--> marble as the chief Roman building material and allowed many daring architectural schemata. Also in the 1st century BC, <!--del_lnk--> Vitruvius wrote <i><!--del_lnk--> De architectura</i>, possibly the first complete treatise on architecture in history. In late 1st century BC, Rome also began to use <!--del_lnk--> glassblowing soon after its invention in <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> about 50 BC. <a href="../../wp/m/Mosaic.htm" title="Mosaic">Mosaics</a> took the Empire by storm after samples were retrieved during <!--del_lnk--> Lucius Cornelius Sulla's campaigns in Greece.</p>
       <p>Concrete made possible the paved, durable <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_roads.htm" title="Roman roads">Roman roads</a>, many of which were still in use a thousand years after the fall of Rome. The construction of a vast and efficient travel network throughout the Empire dramatically increased Rome's power and influence. It was originally constructed to allow <!--del_lnk--> Roman legions to be rapidly deployed. But these highways also had enormous economic significance, solidifying Rome's role as a trading crossroads&mdash;the origin of the saying "all roads lead to Rome". The Roman government maintained way stations that provided refreshments to travelers at regular intervals along the roads, constructed bridges where necessary, and established a system of horse relays for <!--del_lnk--> couriers that allowed a dispatch to travel up to 800 kilometers (500&nbsp;mi) in 24 hours.</p>
       <p>The Romans constructed numerous <!--del_lnk--> aqueducts to supply water to cities and industrial sites and to aid in <!--del_lnk--> their agriculture. The city of Rome was supplied by 11 aqueducts with a combined length of 350 kilometres (220&nbsp;mi). Most aqueducts were constructed below the surface, with only small portions above ground supported by arches. Sometimes, where valleys deeper than 50 metres (165&nbsp;ft) had to be crossed, <!--del_lnk--> inverted siphons were used to convey water across a valley.<sup class="reference plainlinks nourlexpansion" id="ref_waterhistory"><!--del_lnk--> </sup></p>
       <p>The Romans also made major advancements in <!--del_lnk--> sanitation. Romans were particularly famous for their public <!--del_lnk--> baths, called <i><a href="../../wp/t/Thermae.htm" title="Thermae">thermae</a></i>, which were used for both hygienic and social purposes. Many Roman houses came to have <!--del_lnk--> flush toilets and <!--del_lnk--> indoor plumbing, and a complex <!--del_lnk--> sewer system, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Cloaca Maxima</i>, was used to drain the local <!--del_lnk--> marshes and carry waste into the Tiber river.</p>
       <p>Some historians have speculated that lead pipes in the sewer and plumbing systems led to widespread <!--del_lnk--> lead poisoning, which contributed to the decline in <!--del_lnk--> birth rate and general decay of Roman society leading up to the <!--del_lnk--> fall of Rome. However, lead content would have been minimized because the flow of water from aqueducts could not be shut off; it ran continuously through public and private outlets into the drains, and only a few taps were in use. Other authors have raised similar objections to this theory, also pointing out that Roman water pipes were thickly coated with deposits that would have prevented lead from leaching into the water.</p>

       <p>Ancient Rome is the progenitor of <!--del_lnk--> Western civilization. The <!--del_lnk--> customs, <!--del_lnk--> religion, <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_law.htm" title="Roman law">law</a>, <!--del_lnk--> technology, <!--del_lnk--> architecture, <!--del_lnk--> political system, <!--del_lnk--> military, <!--del_lnk--> literature, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin language">languages</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_alphabet.htm" title="Latin alphabet">alphabet</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a> and many factors and aspects of western civilization are all inherited from Roman advancements.
