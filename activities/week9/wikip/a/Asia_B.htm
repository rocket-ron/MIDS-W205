<p><strong>In Asia, we currently care for approximately 27,000 <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sponsor_A_Child_B.htm">sponsored 
children</a> in 149 SOS Children's Villages.&nbsp; Some of these children have 
joined an SOS Children's Village as a result of one of Asia's natural disasters in the last decade, including the Asian Tsunami 
and the Kashmir earthquake.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Our Family Strengthening Programmes, SOS Medical Centres and SOS 
Social Centres provide services for about a quarter of a million more 
children and their families.</p>
<div>
<p>
By <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/Sponsor_A_Child_B.htm">sponsoring a child</a> in Asia, SOS Children will provide a loving home to a child who may have been orphaned or abandoned.</p>
</div>
<p>Please note that several of the SOS Children's Villages in Asia, particularly in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/i/India_C.htm">India</a> and <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/p/Pakistan_D.htm">Pakistan</a>,
 are now self-sufficient with the generous support of local supporters 
and sponsors. In these Villages, supporters from the same country as the
 SOS Children's Village pay for child sponsorships and construction 
projects. We believe this is a positive step for our charity and it allows our work to develop in new areas.</p>
<div>
<h2><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_KBImage_preview" alt="Central Asia map" />SOS Central Asian Child Sponsorship</h2>
<h3>Armenia<br /></h3>
<p>Following a devastating earthquake in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/a/Armenia_B.htm">Armenia</a></strong>
 in 1988, we constructed an SOS Children's Village for orphaned 
children in the town of Kotayk, just outside the area that had been 
destroyed and about 10 miles from the capital Yerevan.&nbsp; A second Village later opened in Idjevan.</p>
<h3>Azerbaijan<br /></h3>
<p>At present SOS Children support over 9,600 people in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan_C.htm">Azerbaijan</a></strong>
 through two SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages, one SOS Youth Home, one SOS Nursery 
School, one SOS Playbus and two SOS Family Strengthening Programmes.</p>
<h3>Bangladesh<br /></h3>
<p>In <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh_B.htm">Bangladesh</a></strong>
 we currently run five SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages.&nbsp; Bangladesh is prone to 
extreme weather conditions.&nbsp; SOS Children&#x2019;s Village Chittagong was built
 after severe flooding, and also doubles up as a cyclone shelter.</p>
<h3>Georgia</h3>
<p>In <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/g/Georgia_A.htm">Georgia</a></strong> we operate two SOS Children&#x2019;s 
Villages.&nbsp; One is located in the capital Tbilisi, and is supported by 
Family Strengthening Programmes and an SOS Playbus.&nbsp; The other is 
located in the country&#x2019;s second city, Kutaisi.</p>
<h3>India</h3>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/i/India_C.htm">India</a></strong> is home to the largest amount of SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages in the 
world.&nbsp; We run 33 SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages throughout the country.&nbsp; In 
total we support 58,000 people.&nbsp; The SOS Children's Villages are located all over the vast country.</p>
<h3><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_DHImage_preview" alt="Child from Astana, Kazakhstan" height="377" width="250" />Kazakhstan</h3>
<p>Our most recent SOS Children's Village in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan_A.htm">Kazakhstan</a></strong> was opened in 2004.&nbsp; We have three villages now in the country, including one in the capital Astana.</p>
<h3>Kyrgyzstan</h3>
<p>There are two SOS Children's Villages in the north of <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/k/Kyrgyzstan_A.htm">Kyrgyzstan</a></strong>, one in the capital Bishkek, the other in Cholpon Ata.</p>
<h3>Nepal</h3>
<p>A ninth SOS Children's Village opened in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/n/Nepal_B.htm">Nepal</a></strong> in March 2010 in Lumbini, in
 the west of the country. The SOS Children's Village consists of 15 family houses which
 can provide a new home for up to 150 children.&nbsp; We have been working in Nepal since the 1970s.</p>
<h3>Pakistan</h3>
<p>We began working in <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/p/Pakistan_D.htm">Pakistan</a></strong> in 1977 when the first community was built in Lahore.
 Today, this SOS Children's Village is considered a model for modern 
child care in Pakistan.&nbsp; After the earthquake in Kashmir in 2005, SOS 
Children was named legal guardian of all unaccompanied children.&nbsp; An 
Emergency Relief Programme was initiated by us following the 2010 
flooding.</p>
<p>Please note that child sponsorship works slightly differently in 
Pakistan. See our <a title="Sponsor a child in Pakistan" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/p/Pakistan_D.htm">Pakistan page</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Sri Lanka</h3>
<p>Since August 2009, following the climax of the civil war, SOS 
Children has been running a childcare centre at the huge Chettikulam 
refugee camp close to the city of Vavuniya in northern <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka_B.htm">Sri Lanka</a></strong>.  The 
childcare centre provides temporary shelter, education and care to 
around 200 children orphaned or separated from their families.&nbsp; There are five SOS Children's Villages on the island.</p>
<h3>Uzbekistan</h3>
<p>We began working in <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan_A.htm">Uzbekistan</a></strong> in 1999 with the construction of SOS Children's Village Tashkent, on land donated by the government. A second SOS Children's Village in Uzbekistan opened in the ancient city of Samarkand
 in 2007.</p>

<h3>Cambodia<br /></h3>
<p>As nearly 10% of children in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/c/Cambodia_C.htm">Cambodia</a></strong>
 are orphans, the need for our work is great.&nbsp; We run three SOS 
Children&#x2019;s Villages in Cambodia, including a village in Phnom Penh, the 
capital.</p>
<h3>China, People&#x2019;s Republic of<br /></h3>
<p>We run nine SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/c/China_C.htm">China</a></strong>,
 including Villages in large cities like Beijing and Tianjin.&nbsp; There is 
also a village in Lhasa, on the Tibetan Plateau and a village in Urumqi,
 in the west of the vast country.</p>
<h3>Indonesia<br /></h3>
<p>Three of our eight SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/i/Indonesia_B.htm">Indonesia</a></strong>: Banda Aceh, Medan and Meulaboh, located in Northern Sumatra, were built directly as a result of the Asian Tsunami in 2004.</p>
<h3>South Korea</h3>
<p>Our community in Daegu, in <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/South_Korea_A.htm"><strong>South Korea</strong></a>,
 was the first SOS Children's Village opened in Asia.&nbsp; It was 
constructed in 1965.&nbsp; Since then, two more SOS Children's Villages have 
been opened in South Korea, including a Village in the capital Seoul.</p>
<h3>Laos<br /></h3>
<p>Since we started working in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/l/Laos_B.htm">Laos</a></strong> in 1995, we have opened six SOS Children's Villages in the country. The sixth SOS Children's Village was recently opened in Savannakhet in the south of the country. It has 15 family houses, an SOS Nursery School and an SOS Social Centre.</p>
<h3>Mongolia</h3>
<p>At present we support over 700 people in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/m/Mongolia_A.htm">Mongolia</a></strong> through two SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages, one SOS Youth Home, one SOS Social Centre and one SOS Vocational Training Centre.</p>
<h3>Philippines, The</h3>
<p>We run eight SOS Children's Village in the <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/p/Philippines_B.htm">Philippines</a></strong>.&nbsp; On top of this, SOS Children runs SOS Schools, SOS Vocational Training Centres and <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/f/Family_Strengthening_B.htm">Family Strengthening Programmes</a>
 (FSPs) in the Philippines. FSPs aim to stop child abandonment and to 
keep families together, by providing child care, counselling, vocational
 training and medical support. In total, through all of our programmes 
(including the Villages and the FSPs) we are reaching more than 
6,700 Filipinos.</p>
<h3>Thailand</h3>
<p>SOS Children began its work in the country in 1972. The fifth SOS Children's Village in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/t/Thailand_A.htm">Thailand</a></strong> was opened in<strong> </strong>Phuket 
in 2008. The community was established to help children in the southern 
region, particularly children who had lost their families in the Tsunami
 disaster.</p>
<h3>Vietnam</h3>
<p>We operate 13 SOS Children's Villages in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_B.htm">Vietnam</a></strong>, from the north to the south of the country.&nbsp; The most recent, Dien Bien Phu, was opened in December 2009.</p>
<h1><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_CGImage_preview" alt="Child from Jorpati, Nepal" height="250" width="363" />The Story of SOS Child Sponsorship in Asia<br /></h1>
<div>
<div>
<p>The first SOS Children's Village in Asia was opened in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/South_Korea_A.htm">South Korea</a>
 in 1965. The sensational '<em>Rice Grain</em>' fund-raising campaign made it 
possible to open a village in Daegu for Korean War orphans, which was the first SOS Children's Village outside of Europe.</p>
<p>The family-based concept was integrated smoothly into the cultural 
context of most Asian countries. Another important aspect is that SOS 
Children is an apolitical and secular organisation which 
carries out its activities in each country as a local association, 
employing local people. SOS Children requires permission from
 the relevant government to begin working in its country. The fact that 
SOS Children is classed as a national and unbiased 
organisation in the countries we work in makes it possible for us to become 
involved in many cases, such as in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka_B.htm">Sri Lanka</a>.</p>
<p><a class="internal" href="../../wp/i/India_C.htm">India</a> now has the most SOS Children's Villages in the world. There are also eight SOS Children's Villages for <a class="internal" href="../../wp/t/Tibetan_India.htm">Tibetan</a> children, two of which, Dharamsala and Leh-Ladakh, are the biggest in the world. <a class="internal" href="../../wp/n/Nepal_B.htm">Nepal</a>
 also has villages and facilities specifically for Tibetan children, who
 grow up according to their own culture and religion and speaking their 
own language. Since 2000 there has even been an SOS Children's Village 
in Lhasa, in the <a class="internal" href="../../wp/t/Tibetan_India.htm">Tibet</a> Autonomous Region and there are nine in total in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/c/China_C.htm">China</a>.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, SOS Children was 
also able to gain a foothold in Central Asia, where the provisions for 
and the care of orphans was a great cause for concern. The social 
transformation experience also stretched increasing numbers of families
 to the limit; alcoholism, neglect and poverty
 meant that many children did not receive adequate care or had to live 
elsewhere. Our first village in Georgia marked the beginning of a quick growth in villages in 1996. Projects followed in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan_A.htm">Kazakhstan</a>, <a class="internal" href="../../wp/k/Kyrgyzstan_A.htm">Kyrgyzstan</a>, <a class="internal" href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan_C.htm">Azerbaijan</a> and <a class="internal" href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan_A.htm">Uzbekistan</a>. It was finally possible to open an SOS Children's Village in 2002 in Ulaanbaatar which is the capital of <a class="internal" href="../../wp/m/Mongolia_A.htm">Mongolia</a>.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_NJImage_preview" alt="sponsor a child in China" height="250" width="377" />SOS Children's work in Asia has not always been easy, as
 a result of political events and influence. One of the saddest moments 
came in 1976 when children, mothers and staff members were forced to 
flee the SOS Children's Villages in Da Lat and Go Vap in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_B.htm">Vietnam</a>. SOS Children was not able to return to work in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_B.htm">Vietnam</a> until 1987. There are now twelve SOS Children's Villages in the country.</p>
<p>SOS Children's work in Asia has increasingly been characterised by emergency relief
 action, which has often been followed by the construction of SOS Children's 
Villages and other social facilities. In the aftermath of 
environmental and natural disasters and political unrest in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/i/India_C.htm">India</a> (violent conflicts in Assam and <a class="internal" href="../../wp/p/Pakistan_D.htm">Kashmir</a>,
 a poisonous gas leak in Bhopal, floods and storms in Visakhapatnam and 
Orissa, earthquakes in Latur and Gujarat) and after the devastating 
earthquake in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/p/Pakistan_D.htm">Pakistan</a>
 in 2005, SOS Children has been at work. In Pakistan, SOS Children also provided support for
 stranded Afghan refugees, particularly through its medical and 
educational facilities.</p>
<p>SOS Children's largest Emergency Relief Programme to date, which was spread out over several countries, was the
 relief programme that was launched following the tsunami disaster on 
26 December 2004. As part of the immediate emergency relief in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/i/Indonesia_B.htm">Indonesia</a>, <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka_B.htm">Sri Lanka</a>, India and <a class="internal" href="../../wp/t/Thailand_A.htm">Thailand</a>, a total of 2,232 family houses were built.&nbsp; On top of this 18 community
 centres, three SOS Social Centres and six SOS Children's Villages were constructed, over a period of three years. In addition, more than 340 fishing 
boats were made available. This emergency relief and reconstruction aid 
was made possible because people in Europe were impressively willing to make 
donations. Considerable donations were also made in the countries 
themselves (such as in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/i/India_C.htm">India</a>).</p>
