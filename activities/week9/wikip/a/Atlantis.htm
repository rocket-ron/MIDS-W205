       <p><b>Atlantis</b> (in <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greek.htm" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F08;&tau;&lambda;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#x1F76;&sigmaf; &nu;&#x1FC6;&sigma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, "island of <!--del_lnk--> Atlas") is a <!--del_lnk--> legendary island first mentioned in <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>'s dialogues <i><!--del_lnk--> Timaeus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Critias</i>, written about 360 BC. According to Plato, Atlantis was a <!--del_lnk--> naval power lying "in front of the <!--del_lnk--> Pillars of Hercules" that conquered many parts of Western Europe and Africa 9,000 years before the time of <!--del_lnk--> Solon, or approximately 9600 BC. After a failed attempt to invade <!--del_lnk--> Athens, Atlantis sank into the ocean "in a single day and night of misfortune".</p>
       <p>Scholars dispute whether and how much Plato's story or account was inspired by older traditions. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Critias</i>, Plato claims that his accounts of ancient Athens and Atlantis stem from a visit to <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egypt</a> by the legendary Athenian lawgiver <!--del_lnk--> Solon in the 6th century BC. In Egypt, Solon met a priest of <!--del_lnk--> Sais, who translated the history of ancient Athens and Atlantis, recorded on <!--del_lnk--> papyri in <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian hieroglyphs, into <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a>. Some scholars argue Plato drew upon memories of past events such as the <!--del_lnk--> Thera eruption or the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>, while others insist that he took inspiration from contemporary events like the destruction of <!--del_lnk--> Helike in 373 BC or the failed <!--del_lnk--> Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415&ndash;413 BC.</p>
       <p>The possible existence of a genuine Atlantis was discussed throughout <!--del_lnk--> classical antiquity, but it was usually rejected and occasionally parodied by later authors. <!--del_lnk--> Alan Cameron states: "It is only in modern times that people have taken the Atlantis story seriously; no one did so in antiquity". The <i>Timaeus</i> remained known in a <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> rendition by <!--del_lnk--> Calcidius through the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, and the allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up by <a href="../../wp/h/Humanism.htm" title="Humanism">Humanists</a> in <!--del_lnk--> utopian works of several <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> writers, such as <a href="../../wp/f/Francis_Bacon.htm" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>'s <i><!--del_lnk--> New Atlantis</i> and <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_More.htm" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a>'s <i><!--del_lnk--> Utopia</i>. Atlantis inspires today's literature, from science fiction to comic books to films. Its name has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p><a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>'s dialogues <i>Timaeus</i> and <i>Critias</i>, written in 360 BC, contain the earliest references to Atlantis. For unknown reasons, Plato never completed <i>Critias</i>. Plato introduced Atlantis in <i>Timaeus</i>:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed the course of a mighty host, which, starting from a distant point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of Europe, and Asia to boot. For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>The four persons appearing in those two dialogues are the politicians <!--del_lnk--> Critias and <!--del_lnk--> Hermocrates as well as the philosophers <a href="../../wp/s/Socrates.htm" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Timaeus of Locri, although only Critias speaks of Atlantis. In his works Plato makes extensive use of the <!--del_lnk--> Socratic dialogues in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition.</p>
       <p>The <i>Timaeus</i> begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's <i><!--del_lnk--> Republic</i> (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions an allegedly historical tale that would make the perfect example, and follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the <i>Critias</i>. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the "perfect society" and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the "perfect" traits described in the <i>Republic</i>.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Critias"><i>Critias</i></span></h3>
       <p>According to Critias, the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Hellenic</a> gods of old divided the land so that each god might own a lot; <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Libya and <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor combined, but it afterwards was sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean. The Egyptians, Plato asserted, described Atlantis as an island comprising mostly mountains in the northern portions and along the shore, and encompassing a great plain of an oblong shape in the south "extending in one direction three thousand <i><!--del_lnk--> stadia</i> [about 555&nbsp;km; 345&nbsp;mi], but across the centre inland it was two thousand stadia [about 370&nbsp;km; 230&nbsp;mi]." Fifty stadia [9&nbsp;km; 6&nbsp;mi] from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides...broke it off all round about... the central island itself was five stades in diameter [about 0.92&nbsp;km; 0.57&nbsp;mi].</p>
       <p>In Plato's myth, Poseidon fell in love with Cleito, the daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Evenor and Leucippe, who bore him five pairs of male twins. The eldest of these, <!--del_lnk--> Atlas, was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (called the Atlantic Ocean in his honour), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his <!--del_lnk--> fiefdom. Atlas's twin Gadeirus, or Eumelus in Greek, was given the extremity of the island towards the pillars of Hercules. The other four pairs of twins&mdash;Ampheres and Evaemon, <!--del_lnk--> Mneseus and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor, and Azaes and Diaprepes&mdash;were also given "rule over many men, and a large territory."</p>
       <p>Poseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular <!--del_lnk--> moats of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each of the city's rings. The walls were constructed of red, white and black rock quarried from the moats, and were covered with <!--del_lnk--> brass, <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a> and the precious metal <!--del_lnk--> orichalcum, respectively.</p>
       <p>According to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Gibraltar and those who dwelt within them. The Atlanteans had conquered the parts of Libya within the Pillars of Hercules as far as Egypt and the European continent as far as <!--del_lnk--> Tyrrhenia, and subjected its people to slavery. The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire, and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands.</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">But at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and one grievous day and night befell them, when the whole body of your warriors was swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean at that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up by the shoal mud which the island created as it settled down.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> logographer <!--del_lnk--> Hellanicus of Lesbos wrote an earlier work titled <i>Atlantis</i>, of which only a few fragments survive. Hellanicus' work appears to have been a genealogical one concerning the daughters of Atlas (&#x1F08;&tau;&lambda;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#x1F76;&sigmaf; in Greek means "of Atlas"), but some authors have suggested a possible connection with Plato's island. <!--del_lnk--> John V. Luce notes that when he writes about the genealogy of Atlantis's kings, Plato writes in the same style as Hellanicus and suggests a similarity between a fragment of Hellanicus's work and an account in the <i>Critias</i>. Robert Castleden suggests Plato may have borrowed his title from Hellanicus, and that Hellanicus may have based his work on an earlier work on Atlantis.</p>
       <p>Gunnar Rudberg suggested that Plato's try to realize his political ideas in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Syracuse, Sicily could have heavily inspired the Atlantis account.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Interpretations">Interpretations</span></h2>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient">Ancient</span></h3>
       <p>Some ancient writers viewed Atlantis as fiction while others believed it was real. The philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Crantor, a student of Plato's student <!--del_lnk--> Xenocrates, is often cited as an example of a writer who thought the story to be historical fact. His work, a commentary on Plato's <i>Timaeus</i>, is lost, but <!--del_lnk--> Proclus, a <!--del_lnk--> Neoplatonist of the 5th century AD, reports on it. The passage in question has been represented in the modern literature either as claiming that Crantor actually visited Egypt, had conversations with priests, and saw hieroglyphs confirming the story or as claiming that he learned about them from other visitors to Egypt. Proclus wrote:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">As for the whole of this account of the Atlanteans, some say that it is unadorned history, such as Crantor, the first commentator on Plato. Crantor also says that Plato's contemporaries used to criticize him jokingly for not being the inventor of his Republic but copying the institutions of the Egyptians. Plato took these critics seriously enough to assign to the Egyptians this story about the Athenians and Atlanteans, so as to make them say that the Athenians really once lived according to that system.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>The next sentence is often translated "Crantor adds, that this is testified by the prophets of the Egyptians, who assert that these particulars [which are narrated by Plato] are written on pillars which are still preserved." But in the original, the sentence starts not with the name Crantor but with the ambiguous <i>He</i>, and whether this referred to Crantor or to Plato is the subject of considerable debate. Proponents of both Atlantis as a myth and Atlantis as history have argued that the word refers to Crantor.</p>
       <p>Alan Cameron argues that it should be interpreted as referring to Plato, and that when Proclus writes that "we must bear in mind concerning this whole feat of the Athenians, that it is neither a mere myth nor unadorned history, although some take it as history and others as myth", he is treating "Crantor's view as mere personal opinion, nothing more; in fact he first quotes and then dismisses it as representing one of the two unacceptable extremes".</p>
       <p>Cameron also points out that whether <i>he</i> refers to Plato or to Crantor, the statement does not support conclusions such as Otto Muck's "Crantor came to Sais and saw there in the temple of Neith the column, completely covered with hieroglyphs, on which the history of Atlantis was recorded. Scholars translated it for him, and he testified that their account fully agreed with Plato's account of Atlantis" or J. V. Luce's suggestion that Crantor sent "a special enquiry to Egypt" and that he may simply be referring to Plato's own claims.</p>
       <p>Another passage from Proclus' commentary on the <i>Timaeus</i> gives a description of the geography of Atlantis:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>That an island of such nature and size once existed is evident from what is said by certain authors who investigated the things around the outer sea. For according to them, there were seven islands in that sea in their time, sacred to <!--del_lnk--> Persephone, and also three others of enormous size, one of which was sacred to Hades, another to Ammon, and another one between them to Poseidon, the extent of which was a thousand stadia [200&nbsp;km]; and the inhabitants of it&mdash;they add&mdash;preserved the remembrance from their ancestors of the immeasurably large island of Atlantis which had really existed there and which for many ages had reigned over all islands in the Atlantic sea and which itself had like-wise been sacred to Poseidon. Now these things Marcellus has written in his <i>Aethiopica</i>".</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Marcellus remains unidentified.</p>
       <p>Other ancient historians and philosophers believing in the existence of Atlantis were <!--del_lnk--> Strabo and <!--del_lnk--> Posidonius.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Plato's account of Atlantis may have also inspired <!--del_lnk--> parodic imitation: writing only a few decades after the <i>Timaeus</i> and <i>Critias</i>, the historian <!--del_lnk--> Theopompus of <!--del_lnk--> Chios wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as <!--del_lnk--> Meropis. This description was included in Book 8 of his voluminous <i>Philippica</i>, which contains a dialogue between King <!--del_lnk--> Midas and <!--del_lnk--> Silenus, a companion of <!--del_lnk--> Dionysus. Silenus describes the Meropids, a race of men who grow to twice normal size, and inhabit two cities on the island of Meropis (Cos?): <i>Eusebes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&Epsilon;&#x1F50;&sigma;&epsilon;&beta;&#x3AE;&sigmaf;</span>, "Pious-town") and <i>Machimos</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&Mu;&#x3AC;&chi;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, "Fighting-town"). He also reports that an army of ten million soldiers crossed the ocean to conquer <!--del_lnk--> Hyperborea, but abandoned this proposal when they realized that the Hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth. Heinz-G&uuml;nther Nesselrath has argued that these and other details of Silenus' story are meant as imitation and exaggeration of the Atlantis story, for the purpose of exposing Plato's ideas to ridicule.</p>
       <p>Zoticus, a <!--del_lnk--> Neoplatonist philosopher of the 3rd century AD, wrote an epic poem based on Plato's account of Atlantis.</p>
       <p>The 4th century historian <!--del_lnk--> Ammianus Marcellinus, relying on a lost work by <!--del_lnk--> Timagenes, a historian writing in the 1st century BC, writes that the <!--del_lnk--> Druids of <!--del_lnk--> Gaul said that part of the inhabitants of Gaul had migrated there from distant islands. Some have understood Ammianus's testimony as a claim that at the time of Atlantis's actual sinking into the sea, its inhabitants fled to western Europe; but Ammianus in fact says that &ldquo;the Drasidae (Druids) recall that a part of the population is indigenous but others also migrated in from islands and lands beyond the <a href="../../wp/r/Rhine.htm" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>" (<i>Res Gestae</i> 15.9), an indication that the immigrants came to Gaul from the north (Britain, the Netherlands or Germany), not from a theorized location in the Atlantic Ocean to the south-west. Instead, the Celts that dwelled along the ocean were reported to venerate twin gods (<!--del_lnk--> Dioscori) that appeared to them coming from that ocean.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Jewish_and_Christian">Jewish and Christian</span></h3>
       <p>The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Philo in the early 1st century AD wrote about the destruction of Atlantis in his <i>On the Eternity of the World</i>, xxvi. 141:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">...And the island of Atalantes which was greater than Africa and Asia, as Plato says in the Timaeus, in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inundation and suddenly disappeared, becoming sea, not indeed navigable, but full of gulfs and eddies.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Some scholars believe<!--del_lnk--> Clement of Rome cryptically referred to Atlantis in his <!--del_lnk--> First Epistle of Clement, 20: 8:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">...The ocean which is impassable for men, and the worlds beyond it, are directed by the same ordinances of the Master.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>On this passage the theologian <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Barber Lightfoot (<i>Apostolic Fathers</i>, 1885, II, p.&nbsp;84) noted: "Clement may possibly be referring to some known, but hardly accessible land, lying without the pillars of Hercules. But more probably he contemplated some unknown land in the far west beyond the ocean, like the fabled Atlantis of Plato..."</p>
       <p>Other early Christian writers wrote about Atlantis, though they had mixed views on whether it once existed or was an untrustworthy myth of pagan origin. <!--del_lnk--> Tertullian believed Atlantis was once real and wrote that in the Atlantic Ocean once existed "(the isle) that was equal in size to Libya or Asia" referring to Plato's geographical description of Atlantis. The early Christian apologist writer <!--del_lnk--> Arnobius also believed Atlantis once existed but blamed its destruction on pagans.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Cosmas Indicopleustes in the 6th century wrote of Atlantis in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Christian Topography</i> in an attempt to prove his theory that the world was flat and surrounded by water:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">...In like manner the philosopher Timaeus also describes this Earth as surrounded by the Ocean, and the Ocean as surrounded by the more remote earth. For he supposes that there is to westward an island, Atlantis, lying out in the Ocean, in the direction of Gadeira (Cadiz), of an enormous magnitude, and relates that the ten kings having procured mercenaries from the nations in this island came from the earth far away, and conquered Europe and Asia, but were afterwards conquered by the Athenians, while that island itself was submerged by God under the sea. Both Plato and Aristotle praise this philosopher, and Proclus has written a commentary on him. He himself expresses views similar to our own with some modifications, transferring the scene of the events from the east to the west. Moreover he mentions those ten generations as well as that earth which lies beyond the Ocean. And in a word it is evident that all of them borrow from Moses, and publish his statements as their own.</div>

People had begun believing that the <a href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm" title="Maya civilization">Mayan</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aztec.htm" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> ruins could possibly be the remnants of Atlantis.</p>
       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Impact_of_Mayanism">Impact of Mayanism</span></h5>
       <p>Much speculation began as to the origins of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm" title="Mayans">Mayans</a>, which lead to a variety of narratives and publications which tried to rationalize the discoveries within the context of the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> and which had undertones of <!--del_lnk--> racism in their connections between the Old and New World. The <!--del_lnk--> Europeans believed the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous people to be inferior and incapable of building that which was now in <!--del_lnk--> ruins and by sharing a common <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a> they insinuate that another race must have been responsible.</p>
       <p>In the middle and late 19th century, several renowned <!--del_lnk--> Mesoamerican <!--del_lnk--> scholars, starting with <!--del_lnk--> Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, and including <!--del_lnk--> Edward Herbert Thompson and <!--del_lnk--> Augustus Le Plongeon, formally proposed that Atlantis was somehow related to Mayan and <a href="../../wp/a/Aztec.htm" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> culture.</p>
       <p>French scholar <!--del_lnk--> Brasseur de Bourbourg traveled extensively through <!--del_lnk--> Mesoamerica in the mid-1800s, and was renowned for his translations of <!--del_lnk--> Mayan texts, most notably the <!--del_lnk--> sacred book <!--del_lnk--> Popol Vuh, as well as a comprehensive <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a> of the region. However, soon after these publications, <!--del_lnk--> Brasseur de Bourbourg lost his academic credibility, due to his claim that the <!--del_lnk--> Maya peoples had descended from the <!--del_lnk--> Toltecs, who he believed were the surviving population of the racially superior <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a> of Atlantis. His work combined with the skillful, romantic illustrations of <!--del_lnk--> Jean Frederic Waldeck, which visually alluded to <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and other aspects of the <!--del_lnk--> Old World, creating an authoritative <!--del_lnk--> fantasy and exciting much interest in the connections between worlds.</p>
       <p>Inspired by Brasseur de Bourbourg&rsquo;s diffusion theories, pseudoarchaeologist <!--del_lnk--> Augustus Le Plongeon traveled to <!--del_lnk--> Mesoamerica and performed some of the first <!--del_lnk--> excavations of many famous Mayan ruins. Le Plongeon invented <!--del_lnk--> narratives, such as the kingdom of Moo saga, which <!--del_lnk--> romantically drew connections between himself, his wife Alice, and <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian deities <!--del_lnk--> Osiris and <a href="../../wp/i/Isis.htm" title="Isis">Isis</a>, as well as with <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Schliemann, who had just discovered the ancient city of <!--del_lnk--> Troy from <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> epics. He also believed that he had found connections between the <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Mayan languages, which produced a <!--del_lnk--> narrative of the destruction of Atlantis.</p>
       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ignatius_Donnelly">Ignatius Donnelly</span></h5>
       <p>The 1882 publication of <i><!--del_lnk--> Atlantis: the Antediluvian World</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Ignatius L. Donnelly stimulated much popular interest in Atlantis. He was greatly inspired by early works in <!--del_lnk--> Mayanism, and like them attempted to establish that all known <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Ancient civilizations">ancient civilizations</a> were descended from Atlantis, which he saw as a technologically sophisticated, more advanced <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a>. Donnelly drew parallels between creation stories in the Old and New Worlds, attributing the connections to Atlantis, where he believed existed the Biblical <!--del_lnk--> Garden of Eden. As implied by the title of his book, he also believed that Atlantis was destroyed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Flood_myth.htm" title="Great Flood">Great Flood</a> mentioned in the Bible.</p>
       <p>Donnelly is credited as the "father of 19th century Atlantis revival" and is the reason the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Myth">myth</a> endures today. He unintentionally promoted an alternative method of inquiry to history and science and the idea that myths contain hidden information that opens them to "ingenious" interpretation by people who believe they have new or special insight.</p>
       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Madame_Blavatsky_and_the_Theosophists">Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophists</span></h5>
       <p>The Russian mystic <!--del_lnk--> Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and her partner <!--del_lnk--> Henry Steel Olcott founded their <!--del_lnk--> Theosophical Society in the 1870s with a philosophy that combined western <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">romanticism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> eastern religious concepts. Blavatsky and her followers in this group are often cited as the founders of <!--del_lnk--> New Age and other spiritual movements.</p>
       <p>Blavatsky took up <!--del_lnk--> Donnelly&rsquo;s interpretations when she wrote <i><!--del_lnk--> The Secret Doctrine</i> (1888), which she claimed was originally dictated in Atlantis itself. She maintained that the Atlanteans were cultural heroes (contrary to <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>, who describes them mainly as a military threat). She believed in a form of racial <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a> (as opposed to primate evolution), in which the Atlanteans were the fourth "<!--del_lnk--> Root Race", succeeded by the fifth and most superior "<!--del_lnk--> Aryan race" (her own race). The <!--del_lnk--> Theosophists believed that the civilization of Atlantis reached its peak between 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago but destroyed itself through internal <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="Warfare">warfare</a> brought about by the inhabitants' dangerous use of <!--del_lnk--> psychic and <!--del_lnk--> supernatural powers.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Rudolf Steiner, the founder of <!--del_lnk--> Anthroposophy and <!--del_lnk--> Waldorf Schools, along with other well known <!--del_lnk--> Theosophists, such as <!--del_lnk--> Annie Besant, also wrote of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Cultural">cultural</a> evolution in much the same vein.</p>
       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Nazism_and_occultism">Nazism and occultism</span></h5>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Blavatsky had also been inspired by the work of the 18th-century <!--del_lnk--> astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Sylvain Bailly, who had "Orientalized" the Atlantis <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Myth">myth</a> in his mythical continent of <!--del_lnk--> Hyperborea, a reference to <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek myths">Greek myths</a> featuring a Northern European region of the same name, home to a giant, godlike race. Her retooling of this theory in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Secret Doctrine</i> provided the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazis">Nazis</a> with a mythological precedent and pretense for their ideological platform and subsequent genocide.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Julius Evola&rsquo;s writing in 1934 also suggested that the Atlanteans were <!--del_lnk--> Hyperborean, <!--del_lnk--> Nordic supermen who originated at the North Pole (see <!--del_lnk--> Thule). Similarly, <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Rosenberg (in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Myth of the Twentieth Century</i>, 1930) spoke of a "Nordic-Atlantean" or "Aryan-Nordic" master race.</p>
       <h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Edgar_Cayce">Edgar Cayce</span></h5>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Edgar Cayce was a man from humble upbringings in <!--del_lnk--> Kentucky who allegedly possessed <!--del_lnk--> psychic abilities, which were performed from a trance-like state. In addition to healing the sick from this state, he also spoke frequently on the topic of Atlantis. In his "life readings," he purportedly revealed that many of his subjects were <!--del_lnk--> reincarnations of people that had lived on Atlantis, and by tapping into their <!--del_lnk--> collective consciousness, the "<!--del_lnk--> Akashic Records&rdquo; (a term borrowed from <!--del_lnk--> Theosophy), he was able to give detailed descriptions of the lost continent. He also asserted that Atlantis would "rise" again in the 1960s (sparking much popularity of the myth in that decade), as well as that there is a "<!--del_lnk--> Hall of Records" beneath the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian Sphinx that holds the historical texts of Atlantis.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_times">Recent times</span></h4>
       <p>As <!--del_lnk--> continental drift became more widely accepted during the 1960s, and the increased understanding of <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a> demonstrated the impossibility of a lost continent in the geologically recent past, most &ldquo;Lost Continent&rdquo; theories of Atlantis began to wane in popularity.</p>
       <p>Plato scholar Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Julia Annas, <!--del_lnk--> Regents Professor of Philosophy at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Arizona, had this to say on the matter:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">The continuing industry of discovering Atlantis illustrates the dangers of reading Plato. For he is clearly using what has become a standard device of fiction&mdash;stressing the historicity of an event (and the discovery of hitherto unknown authorities) as an indication that what follows is fiction. <i>The idea is that we should use the story to examine our ideas of government and power</i>. We have missed the point if instead of thinking about these issues we go off exploring the sea bed. The continuing misunderstanding of Plato as historian here enables us to see why his distrust of imaginative writing is sometimes justified.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Kenneth Feder points out that Critias's story in the <i>Timaeus</i> provides a major clue. In the dialogue, Critias says, referring to Socrates' hypothetical society:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">And when you were speaking yesterday about your city and citizens, the tale which I have just been repeating to you came into my mind, and I remarked with astonishment how, by some mysterious coincidence, you agreed in almost every particular with the narrative of Solon. ...</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Feder quotes A. E. Taylor, who wrote, "We could not be told much more plainly that the whole narrative of Solon's conversation with the priests and his intention of writing the poem about Atlantis are an invention of Plato's fancy."</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Location_hypotheses">Location hypotheses</span></h2>
       <p>Since Donnelly's day, there have been dozens of locations proposed for Atlantis, to the point where the name has become a generic concept, divorced from the specifics of Plato's account. This is reflected in the fact that many proposed sites are not within the Atlantic at all. Few today are scholarly or archaeological hypotheses, while others have been made by <!--del_lnk--> psychic or other <!--del_lnk--> pseudoscientific means. Many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the Atlantis story (water, catastrophic end, relevant time period), but none has been demonstrated to be a true historical Atlantis.</p>

       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="In_or_near_the_Mediterranean_Sea">In or near the Mediterranean Sea</span></h3>
       <p>Most of the historically proposed locations are in or near the Mediterranean Sea: islands such as <!--del_lnk--> Sardinia, <!--del_lnk--> Crete, <a href="../../wp/s/Santorini.htm" title="Santorini">Santorini</a>, Sicily, Cyprus, and <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a>; land-based cities or states such as <!--del_lnk--> Troy, <!--del_lnk--> Tartessos, and Tantalus (in the province of <!--del_lnk--> Manisa, <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>); <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>-<!--del_lnk--> Sinai or <!--del_lnk--> Canaan; and northwestern Africa. The <!--del_lnk--> Thera eruption, dated to the 17th or 16th century BC, caused a large <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a> that some experts hypothesize devastated the <a href="../../wp/m/Minoan_civilization.htm" title="Minoan civilization">Minoan civilization</a> on the nearby island of Crete, further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe that inspired the story.</p>
       <p>A. G. Galanopoulos argued that Plato's dating of 9,000 years before Solon's time was the result of an error in translation, probably from Egyptian into Greek, which produced "thousands" instead of "hundreds". Such an error would also rescale Plato's Atlantis to the size of Crete, while leaving the city the size of the crater on Thera; 900 years before Solon would be the 15th century BC. In the area of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> the following locations have been proposed: <!--del_lnk--> Bosporus and <!--del_lnk--> Ancomah (a legendary place near <!--del_lnk--> Trabzon).</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="In_the_Atlantic_Ocean_and_Europe">In the Atlantic Ocean and Europe</span></h3>
       <p>In 2011, a team, working on a documentary for the <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic Channel, led by Professor Richard Freund from the <!--del_lnk--> University of Hartford, claimed to have found evidence of Atlantis in southwestern <!--del_lnk--> Andalusia. The team identified its possible location within the <!--del_lnk--> marshlands of the <!--del_lnk--> Do&ntilde;ana National Park, in <!--del_lnk--> the area that once was the <!--del_lnk--> Lacus Ligustinus, between the <!--del_lnk--> Huelva, <!--del_lnk--> C&aacute;diz and <!--del_lnk--> Seville provinces, and speculated that Atlantis had been destroyed by a <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a>, extrapolating results from a previous study by Spanish researchers, published four years earlier.</p>
       <p>Spanish scientists have dismissed Freund's speculations, claiming that he sensationalised their work. The anthropologist Juan Villar&iacute;as-Robles, who works with the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish National Research Council, said, "Richard Freund was a newcomer to our project and appeared to be involved in his own very controversial issue concerning King Solomon's search for ivory and gold in <!--del_lnk--> Tartessos, the well documented settlement in the Do&ntilde;ana area established in the first millennium BC", and described Freund's claims as "fanciful".</p>
       <p>A similar theory had previously been put forward by a German researcher, Rainer W. K&uuml;hne, but based only on satellite imagery and placing Atlantis in the <!--del_lnk--> Marismas de Hinojos, north of the city of <!--del_lnk--> C&aacute;diz. Before that, the historian <!--del_lnk--> Adolf Schulten had stated in the 1920s that Plato had used Tartessos as the basis for his Atlantis myth.</p>
       <p>The location of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean has a certain appeal given the closely related names. Popular culture often places Atlantis there, perpetuating the original Platonic setting. Several hypotheses place the sunken island in northern Europe, including <!--del_lnk--> Doggerland in the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> (by <!--del_lnk--> Olof Rudbeck in <i><!--del_lnk--> Atland</i>, 1672&ndash;1702). Some have proposed the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic Shelf as a possible location, and that there is a link to Ireland.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands and <!--del_lnk--> Madeira Islands have also been identified as a possible location, west of the Straits of Gibraltar but in relative proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. Various islands or island groups in the Atlantic were also identified as possible locations, notably the <!--del_lnk--> Azores. However detailed geological studies of the Canary Islands, the Azores, Madeira, and the ocean bottom surrounding them found a complete lack of any evidence for the catastrophic subsidence of these islands at any time during their existence and a complete lack of any evidence that the ocean bottom surrounding them was ever dry land at any time in the recent past, with the exception of what appeared to be beaches. The submerged island of <!--del_lnk--> Spartel near the Strait of Gibraltar has also been suggested.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Other_locations">Other locations</span></h3>
       <p>Several writers have speculated that <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> is the site of Atlantis, while others have proposed <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean</a> locations such the alleged <!--del_lnk--> Cuban sunken city off the <!--del_lnk--> Guanahacabibes peninsula in <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Bermuda Triangle. Areas in the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a> and Indian Oceans have also been proposed including <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> (i.e. <!--del_lnk--> Sundaland). Likewise some have speculated that the continent of South America bears striking similarities to the description of Atlantis by Plato, particularly the <!--del_lnk--> Altiplano region of the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a>. The stories of a lost continent off the coast of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, named "<!--del_lnk--> Kumari Kandam," have inspired some to draw parallels to Atlantis.</p>
