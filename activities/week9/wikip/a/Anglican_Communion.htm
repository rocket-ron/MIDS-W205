       <p>The <b>Anglican Communion</b> is an international association of churches consisting of the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> and of national and regional <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> churches in <!--del_lnk--> full communion with it and specifically with its principal <!--del_lnk--> primate, the <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. There is no single "Anglican Church" with universal juridical authority as each national or regional church has full autonomy.</p>
       <p>The status of full communion means, ideally, that there is mutual agreement on essential doctrines and that full participation in the sacramental life of each church is available to all <!--del_lnk--> communicant Anglicans.</p>
       <p>With a membership currently estimated at around 80 million members worldwide, the Anglican Communion is the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Churches</a>. Some of these churches are known as Anglican, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Anglican Church of Canada, due to their historical link to England (<i>Ecclesia Anglicana</i> means "English Church"). Some, for example the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_Ireland.htm" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>, the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Episcopal_Church.htm" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish</a> and <!--del_lnk--> American Episcopal churches, and some other associated churches have a separate name. Each church has its own <!--del_lnk--> doctrine and <!--del_lnk--> liturgy, based in most cases on that of the Church of England; and each church has its own legislative process and overall <a href="../../wp/e/Episcopal_polity.htm" title="Episcopal polity">episcopal polity</a>, under the leadership of a local primate.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, religious head of the Church of England, has no formal authority outside that jurisdiction, but is recognised as symbolic head of the worldwide communion. Among the other primates, he is considered as <i><!--del_lnk--> primus inter pares</i>.</p>
       <p>The Anglican Communion considers itself to be part of the <!--del_lnk--> One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church and to be both <!--del_lnk--> Catholic and <!--del_lnk--> Reformed. For some adherents it represents a non-papal Catholicism, for others a form of <!--del_lnk--> Protestantism though without a dominant guiding figure such as <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther.htm" title="Martin Luther">Luther</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Knox, <a href="../../wp/j/John_Calvin.htm" title="John Calvin">Calvin</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Zwingli or <a href="../../wp/j/John_Wesley.htm" title="John Wesley">Wesley</a>. For others, their self-identity represents some combination of the two. The communion encompasses a wide spectrum of belief and practice including <!--del_lnk--> evangelical, <!--del_lnk--> liberal, and <!--del_lnk--> Catholic.</p>
       <p>The Anglican Communion Office is headed by its Secretary General, the Reverend Canon Kenneth Kearon.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ecclesiology.2C_polity_and_ethos">Ecclesiology, polity and ethos</span></h2>
       <p>The Anglican Communion has no official legal existence nor any governing structure which might exercise authority over the member churches. There is an Anglican Communion Office in London, under the aegis of the Archbishop of Canterbury, but it only serves in a supporting and organisational role. The Communion is held together by a shared history, expressed in its <!--del_lnk--> ecclesiology, <!--del_lnk--> polity and <!--del_lnk--> ethos and also by participation in international consultative bodies.</p>
       <p>Three elements have been important in holding the Communion together: first, the shared ecclesial structure of the component churches, manifested in an <a href="../../wp/e/Episcopal_polity.htm" title="Episcopal polity">episcopal polity</a> maintained through the <a href="../../wp/a/Apostolic_succession.htm" title="Apostolic succession">apostolic succession</a> of bishops and <!--del_lnk--> synodical government; second, the principle of belief expressed in worship, investing importance in approved prayer books and their rubrics; and third, the historical documents and the writings of early Anglican <!--del_lnk--> divines that have influenced the ethos of the Communion.</p>
       <p>Originally, the Church of England was self-contained and relied for its unity and identity on its own history, its traditional legal and episcopal structure and its status as an <!--del_lnk--> established church of the state. As such Anglicanism was, from the outset, a movement with an explicitly <a href="../../wp/e/Episcopal_polity.htm" title="Episcopal polity">episcopal polity</a>, a characteristic which has been vital in maintaining the unity of the Communion by conveying the episcopate's role in manifesting visible catholicity and ecumenism.</p>
       <p>Early in its development, Anglicanism developed a vernacular prayer book, called the <a href="../../wp/b/Book_of_Common_Prayer.htm" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>. Unlike other traditions, Anglicanism has never been governed by a <!--del_lnk--> magisterium nor by appeal to one founding <!--del_lnk--> theologian, nor by an extra-credal summary of doctrine (such as the <!--del_lnk--> Westminster Confession of the <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian Church). Instead, Anglicans have typically appealed to the Book of Common Prayer (1662) and its offshoots as a guide to Anglican theology and practice. This had the effect of inculcating the principle of <i><!--del_lnk--> lex orandi, lex credendi</i> ("the law of prayer is the law of belief") as the foundation of Anglican identity and confession.</p>
       <p>Protracted conflict through the seventeenth century with more radical <!--del_lnk--> Protestants on the one hand and Roman Catholics who still recognised the primacy of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Pope">Pope</a> on the other, resulted in an association of churches that were both deliberately vague about doctrinal principles, yet bold in developing parameters of acceptable deviation. These parameters were most clearly articulated in the various <!--del_lnk--> rubrics of the successive prayer books, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion. These Articles (though no longer binding) have had an influence on the ethos of the Communion, an ethos reinforced by their interpretation and expansion by such influential early theologians as <!--del_lnk--> Richard Hooker, <!--del_lnk--> Lancelot Andrewes, <!--del_lnk--> John Cosin, and others.</p>
       <p>With the expansion of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, and hence the growth of Anglicanism outside Great Britain and Ireland, the Communion sought to establish new vehicles of unity. The first major expression of this were the <!--del_lnk--> Lambeth Conferences of the communion's bishops, first convened by Archbishop of Canterbury <!--del_lnk--> Charles Longley in 1867. From the outset, these were not intended to displace the autonomy of the emerging provinces of the Communion, but to "discuss matters of practical interest, and pronounce what we deem expedient in resolutions which may serve as safe guides to future action."</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Chicago_Lambeth_Quadrilateral">Chicago Lambeth Quadrilateral</span></h2>
       <p>One of the enduringly influential early resolutions of the conference was the so-called <!--del_lnk--> Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral of 1888. Its intent was to provide the basis for discussions of reunion with the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches, but it had the ancillary effect of establishing parameters of Anglican identity. It establishes four principles with these words:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>That, in the opinion of this Conference, the following Articles supply a basis on which approach may be by God's blessing made towards Home Reunion:</dd>
       </dl>
       <dl>
        <dd>(a) The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as "containing all things necessary to salvation," and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith.</dd>
        <dd>(b) The Apostles' Creed, as the Baptismal Symbol; and the Nicene Creed, as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith.</dd>
        <dd>(c) The two Sacraments ordained by Christ Himself - Baptism and the Supper of the Lord - ministered with unfailing use of Christ's <!--del_lnk--> Words of Institution, and of the elements ordained by Him.</dd>
        <dd>(d) The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the Unity of His Church.</dd>
       </dl>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Instruments_of_communion">Instruments of communion</span></h2>
       <p>As mentioned above, the Anglican Communion has no international juridical organisation. The Archbishop of Canterbury's role is strictly symbolic and unifying and the Communion's three international bodies are consultative and collaborative, their resolutions having no legal effect on the autonomous provinces of the Communion. Taken together, however, the four do function as "instruments of communion", since all churches of the communion participate in them. In order of antiquity, they are:</p>

       <ol>
        <li>The <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> (<i>ab origine</i>) functions as the spiritual head of the Communion. He is the focus of unity, since no church claims membership in the Communion without being in communion with him. The present incumbent is <a href="../../wp/j/Justin_Welby.htm" title="Justin Welby">Justin Welby</a>.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Lambeth Conference (first held in 1867) is the oldest international consultation. It is a forum for bishops of the Communion to reinforce unity and collegiality through manifesting the <!--del_lnk--> episcopate, to discuss matters of mutual concern, and to pass resolutions intended to act as guideposts. It is held roughly every ten years and invitation is by the Archbishop of Canterbury.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Anglican Consultative Council (first met in 1971) was created by a 1968 Lambeth Conference resolution, and meets usually at three-yearly intervals. The council consists of representative bishops, clergy, and laity chosen by the thirty-eight provinces. The body has a permanent secretariat, the Anglican Communion Office, of which the Archbishop of Canterbury is president.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Primates' Meeting (first met in 1979) is the most recent manifestation of international consultation and deliberation, having been first convened by Archbishop <!--del_lnk--> Donald Coggan as a forum for "leisurely thought, prayer and deep consultation".</li>
       </ol>
       <p>Since there is no binding authority in the Communion, these international bodies are a vehicle for consultation and persuasion. In recent years, persuasion has tipped over into debates over conformity in certain areas of doctrine, discipline, worship, and ethics. The most notable example has been the objection of many provinces of the Communion (particularly in Africa and Asia) to the changing role of homosexuals in the North American churches (e.g., by <!--del_lnk--> blessing same-sex unions and ordaining and consecrating gays and lesbians in same-sex relationships), and to the process by which changes were undertaken. Those who objected condemned these actions as unscriptural, unilateral, and without the agreement of the Communion prior to these steps being taken. In response, the <!--del_lnk--> American Episcopal Church and the <!--del_lnk--> Anglican Church of Canada answered that the actions had been undertaken after lengthy scriptural and theological reflection, legally in accordance with their own <!--del_lnk--> canons and constitutions and after extensive consultation with the provinces of the Communion.</p>
       <p>The Primates' Meeting voted to request the two churches to withdraw their delegates from the 2005 meeting of the Anglican Consultative Council. Canada and the United States decided to attend the meeting but without exercising their right to vote. They have not been expelled or suspended, since there is no mechanism in this voluntary association to suspend or expel an independent province of the Communion. Since membership is based on a province's communion with Canterbury, expulsion would require the Archbishop of Canterbury's refusal to be in communion with the affected jurisdiction(s). In line with the suggestion of the <!--del_lnk--> Windsor Report, <a href="../../wp/r/Rowan_Williams.htm" title="Rowan Williams">Rowan Williams</a> (the previous Archbishop of Canterbury) recently established a working group to examine the feasibility of an Anglican covenant which would articulate the conditions for communion in some fashion.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Provinces">Provinces</span></h2>
       <p>All 38 <!--del_lnk--> provinces of the Anglican Communion are autonomous, each with its own <!--del_lnk--> primate and governing structure. These provinces may take the form of national churches (such as in Canada, <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, or Japan) or a collection of nations (such as the <!--del_lnk--> West Indies, <a href="../../wp/c/Central_Africa.htm" title="Central Africa">Central Africa</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia).

       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>The Anglican Communion traces much of its growth to the older mission organisations of the Church of England such as the <!--del_lnk--> Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (founded 1698), the <!--del_lnk--> Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (founded 1701) and the <!--del_lnk--> Church Missionary Society (founded 1799). The <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> (which until the 20th century included the <!--del_lnk--> Church in Wales) initially separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1538 in the reign of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">King Henry VIII</a>, reunited in 1555 under <a href="../../wp/m/Mary_I_of_England.htm" title="Mary I of England">Queen Mary I</a> and then separated again in 1570 under <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_I_of_England.htm" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> (the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated Elizabeth I in 1570 in response to the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Supremacy 1559). The <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> has always thought of itself not as a new foundation but rather as a reformed continuation of the ancient "English Church" (<i>Ecclesia Anglicana</i>) and a reassertion of that church's rights. As such it was a distinctly national phenomenon. The <!--del_lnk--> Church of Scotland separated from the Roman Catholic Church with the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Reformation in 1560 and the split from it of the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Episcopal_Church.htm" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a> began in 1582 in the reign of <a href="../../wp/j/James_VI_and_I.htm" title="James VI and I">James VI of Scotland</a> over disagreements about the role of bishops.</p>
       <p>The oldest-surviving Anglican church outside of the British Isles (Britain and Ireland) is <!--del_lnk--> St Peter's Church in <!--del_lnk--> St. George's, <a href="../../wp/b/Bermuda.htm" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, established in 1612 (though the actual building had to be rebuilt several times over the following century). This is also the oldest surviving non-Roman Catholic church in the <!--del_lnk--> New World. It remained part of the Church of England until 1978 when the <!--del_lnk--> Anglican Church of Bermuda separated. The Church of England was the established church not only in England, but in its trans-Oceanic colonies.</p>
       <p>Thus the only member churches of the present Anglican Communion existing by the mid-18th century were the Church of England, its closely linked sister church, the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_Ireland.htm" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> (which also separated from Roman Catholicism under Henry VIII) and the Scottish Episcopal Church which for parts of the 17th and 18th centuries was partially underground (it was suspected of <!--del_lnk--> Jacobite sympathies).</p>
       <p>However, the enormous expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> brought Anglicanism along with it. At first all these colonial churches were under the jurisdiction of the <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of London. After the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution, the parishes in the newly independent country found it necessary to break formally from a church whose <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Governor was (and remains) the <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Monarchy of the United Kingdom">British monarch</a>. Thus they formed their own dioceses and national church, the <!--del_lnk--> Episcopal Church in the United States of America, in a mostly amicable separation.</p>
       <p>At about the same time, in the colonies which remained linked to the crown, the Church of England began to appoint colonial bishops. In 1787 a bishop of <!--del_lnk--> Nova Scotia was appointed with a jurisdiction over all of British North America; in time several more colleagues were appointed to other cities in present-day Canada. In 1814 a bishop of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/k/Kolkata.htm" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> was made; in 1824 the first bishop was sent to the <!--del_lnk--> West Indies and in 1836 to Australia. By 1840 there were still only ten colonial bishops for the Church of England; but even this small beginning greatly facilitated the growth of Anglicanism around the world. In 1841 a "Colonial Bishoprics Council" was set up and soon many more dioceses were created.</p>
       <p>In time, it became natural to group these into provinces and a <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan was appointed for each province. Although it had at first been somewhat established in many colonies, in 1861 it was ruled that, except where specifically established, the Church of England had just the same legal position as any other church. Thus a colonial bishop and colonial diocese was by nature quite a different thing from their counterparts back home. In time bishops came to be appointed locally rather than from England and eventually national synods began to pass ecclesiastical legislation independent of England.</p>
       <p>A crucial step in the development of the modern communion was the idea of the <!--del_lnk--> Lambeth Conferences (discussed above). These conferences demonstrated that the bishops of disparate churches could manifest the unity of the church in their episcopal collegiality despite the absence of universal legal ties. Some bishops were initially reluctant to attend, fearing that the meeting would declare itself a council with power to legislate for the church; but it agreed to pass only advisory resolutions. These Lambeth Conferences have been held roughly every 10 years since 1878 (the second such conference) and remain the most visible coming-together of the whole Communion.</p>

       <p>The churches of the Anglican Communion have traditionally held that ordination in the <!--del_lnk--> historic episcopate is a core element in the validity of clerical ordinations. The Roman Catholic Church does not recognise most Anglican orders (see <i><!--del_lnk--> Apostolicae Curae</i>). Some <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Churches</a> have issued statements to the effect that Anglican orders could be accepted, yet have still reordained former Anglican clergy; other Orthodox churches have rejected Anglican orders altogether. Orthodox bishop <!--del_lnk--> Kallistos Ware explains this apparent discrepancy as follows:</p>
       <p><i>Anglican clergy who join the Orthodox Church are reordained; but [some Orthodox Churches hold that] if Anglicanism and Orthodoxy were to reach full unity in the faith, perhaps such reordination might not be found necessary. It should be added, however, that a number of individual Orthodox theologians hold that under no circumstances would it be possible to recognise the validity of Anglican Orders.</i></p>
