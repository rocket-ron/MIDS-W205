<h2><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_BIImage_preview" alt="Smiling girl from Nairobi, Kenya" />Child Sponsorship with SOS Children</h2>
<p>If you choose to sponsor a child with SOS Children, you will be directly supporting an orphaned or abandoned child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For SOS Children, the word "<em>sponsor</em>" means money is for "<em>supporting</em>" or "<em>helping to pay for</em>" a child in need.</p>
<p>100% of child sponsorship donations with SOS Children are spent on the care of children. The sponsor 
gets information about the child, can write and visit and see what 
difference their money makes.</p>
<p>Sponsoring is an excellent way of helping children who are alone and in desperate need of help: children who, through no fault of their own, have nothing and no-one following the devastating effects of war, famine, disaster or poverty.</p>
<h3>You can give children a second chance in life</h3>
<p>Sponsor a child and you&#x2019;ll offer them real hope both now and in the future. That&#x2019;s because your money will help provide them with a stable childhood in a permanent home, as well as access to healthcare and a good standard of education. So, when they eventually reach adulthood, they can go on to lead full and independent lives.</p>
<div>
<p>Sponsoring a child can be a thoroughly rewarding experience &#x2013; both for you and the communities you are helping. For them, it is so reassuring to know that there is someone, even on the other side of the world, who cares about them. For you it can be gratifying to see that your money is not a &#x2018;drop in the ocean&#x2019; but is actually making a real difference.</p>
</div>
<h3>Keeping you in touch with regular updates</h3>
<p>You&#x2019;ll receive our regular newsletter featuring fascinating photos and stories on our work in over 500 SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages around the world. We are sure you will also be keen to know how your sponsored child is getting on and from time to time we will send you an update/report on their progress when we can. Plus, you are welcome to write to your sponsored child, for example at their birthday or Christmas.</p>
<p>You can also sign up to <a class="external-link" href="https://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/subscribe">SOS eNews</a> to find out more about how SOS Children is working around the world.</p>
<h3>It&#x2019;s easy to become a sponsor</h3>
<div>
<p>Simply visit our <a title="Sponsor a Child" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/s/Sponsor_A_Child_B.htm">child sponsorship page</a> and click the sponsor online button.&nbsp; Then fill in your details and specify any special instructions you would like us to know about. Once we have received your completed form, we will send you details in 3-4 weeks about your sponsored child.</p>

<h2><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_MIImage_preview" alt="Child at Alwaye Cochin, India" />Pros and Cons of Sponsoring a Child</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>There is some discussion in the media from time to time about whether child
 sponsorship is the best way to help children in poorer countries. Part 
of the problem is that different charities call child sponsorship different things. What we consider child sponsorship is a little different 
from some other charities.&nbsp; Below is an in-depth look at some common child sponsorship criticisms and our responses:</p>
</div>
<h3>

<strong>First argument</strong>:</h3>
<div>
<p>"In most cases child sponsorship is a misnomer. It is community
 development by a different name. Sponsorship contributions are pooled 
with other donations and used to support projects to benefit the local 
community." (Quote from "A Rough Guide to a Better World")</p>
</div>
<h3>

<strong>Our view</strong>:</h3>
<div>
<p>We are not a general poverty relief charity. General poverty relief charities are very good things, but we have a specialised approach concentrating on children
 who are all alone without anyone to care for them.</p>
<p>If you sponsor with SOS
 Children you are primarily paying for your sponsored child to have a home and
 family in an SOS Children's Village. On average, an SOS Children's 
Village also supports around ten children in the community for each 
child who lives in the village (e.g. through providing a school, medical care and a local nurse supporting child-headed families affected by AIDS
 in the nearby area).</p>
<p>Sponsors who started after March 2005 contribute 
towards the full cost of the village and these programmes. But most of 
what you pay for is the direct care of the children you sponsor. They 
are <em><strong>our</strong></em> children, they have no one else to care for them.</p>
</div>
<h3>

<strong>Second argument</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>"It can be degrading for the family and parents 
of a child to be reminded of their dependency on a distant stranger. For
 this reason communication with sponsors is often discouraged".</p>
</div>
<h3>

<strong>Our view</strong>:</h3>
<div>
<p>The children whom we take in have lost their parents 
and have no family to care for them. In circumstances where children 
feel alone and unloved, we believe that sponsorship is actually positive
 rather than degrading for the child to feel there is someone somewhere 
taking an interest in them. We encourage contact between sponsors and 
children. With our special commitment to children who have lost their 
parents, sponsorship is a positive thing.</p>
</div>
<h3> <strong><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_MJImage_preview" alt="Children from Bogota, Colombia" />Third argument:</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>"The administration expenses involved in sponsorship are high and this money could be better used directly helping poverty".</p>
</div>
<h3> <strong>Our view</strong>:</h3>
<div>
<p>If the strict alternative to sponsorship is for all
 the money to be used to help children, then that would be better. Some 
donors give regular donations without sponsorship and they are very 
valued. However, it has been estimated that the whole world's poverty 
could be cured for the amount of money that Europeans spend on ice 
cream. We do not accept the argument that the money which is currently 
spent building relationships between European adults and third-world 
orphans is not money well spent; the alternative is more likely to be 
that more money is spent inside Europe on alternatives, than this money 
would provide in additional aid.</p>
<p>Our administrative and other expenses (including informing you further 
about what your payments are achieving, bank charges and passing on 
correspondence and news) we are more than capable of covering through tax reclaimed from the governent thanks to donors Gift-Aid their contribution, allowing us to reclaim 25% of the donation in tax. We use any left-over reclaimed tax for
 other general charitable purposes worldwide.</p>
<p>We cannot recover tax from people 
who give us CAF vouchers, use payroll giving or do not agree to Gift 
Aid, but that's fine by us. We even have a little left over from those 
who do Gift Aid their donations.</p>

<h3>  
<strong>Fourth argument</strong>:</h3>
<div>
<p>"There are privacy issues involved in publishing details of children available to sponsor".</p>
</div>
<h3> 
<strong>Our view:</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>We agree and we would not do this. Sponsors obviously 
get the real details of the children they support but they are not given
 permission to publish these. We do not post "<em>available to sponsor</em>" 
pictures. Fundraising would be much easier if we broadcast tales of 
children's misery but we do not give out children's details publicly, 
and avoid publishing identifiable photographs and names of children 
unless we have genuine permission to do so (for example in some 
instances from the child themselves once they have grown up). We take 
the issue of protecting our children seriously - after all, that is what 
we are here for.</p>
<p> 

There is one other thing we ought to mention. Since we encourage 
relationships between sponsors and children, when we increase the 
"minimum" price for sponsorship we do not generally terminate 
sponsorships when the sponsor does not feel able to increase their 
contribution (unless the gap becomes very large). Ending a sponsorship 
can give a negative message to a child who has already suffered in life. This means that our average income per sponsorship is 
considerably less than &#xA3;20/month, nearer &#xA3;10/month. 

The actual cost of providing a proper loving home for a child all alone 
varies from country to country but nowhere is it less than &#xA3;40/month 
(Pakistan).</p>
<p>Of course, the cost per child of helping children in the 
community is much less than this: our costs supporting a child-led AIDS
 family are less than &#xA3;10/month per child, but although many charities 
would offer these type of children in the community for sponsorship, we 
keep sponsorship for children living in the villages. (Some donors do 
support children in the community by making a regular donation and 
entering an instruction like "for African Aids Orphans").</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_GLImage_preview" alt="Group of children at Cebu, Philippines" />Each child generally only has a maximum of two sponsors from the UK, although for Basse in The Gambia and Chipata in Zambia this rises to five. Children do sometimes have sponsors from other countries, too.&nbsp;Of course, all the money raised from a child sponsorship goes to that 
child's village and the local community. This may seem less attractive than 
sponsoring with a charity where
 each child only has one sponsor. However, it is important to remember that 
where "sponsorship" includes children who are not directly
 given a home by a charity
 but instead receive the occasional visit from an aid worker, there is generally no guarantee that an individual child is not being sponsored through a number of different charities. several different&nbsp;charities. For example, one may be supporting a nearby school while another is providing&nbsp;<a href="../../wp/s/Sos_Medical_Centres.htm">medical</a>&nbsp;care&nbsp;in a nearby town). If you still wish to sponsor via SOS but would like to be the only sponsor of a child, consider&nbsp;<a title="Sponsor a child in Pakistan" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/p/Pakistan_D.htm">sponsoring in Pakistan</a>. Here,&nbsp;dedicated sponsorship begins at &#xA3;40 not &#xA3;20, but we are able to offer one sponsor per child, or two sponsors at a monthly rate of &#xA3;25.</p>
<p>
You may think that this means our child sponsorship relationship is not the unqiue experience offered by some charities. However, our child sponsors 
recognise that with SOS Children, sponsorship is already rather special. In 
practice the majority of sponsors worldwide do not visit or write 
regularly to their sponsored child. Sponsors that do so are appreciated,
 and develop as unique a personal relationship as can grow between people anywhere in the world.</p>
