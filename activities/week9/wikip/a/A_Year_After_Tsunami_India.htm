<h2>A year post tsunami: look back at India work</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="image-left image-inline" src="../../wp/i/_AOIImage_preview" alt="One year post tsunami India children" /></p>
<p>Many towns and villages on
the south coast of India were flattened by the <a title="Emergency Relief Archive: look back at the Asian Tsunami" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/2/2004_Asian_Tsunami.htm">tsunami</a>; the people who
lived here lost everything. SOS Children has reconstructed over 800
simple but functional family homes, and the new owners are very pleased
with them.</p>
<p>Two new SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages will provide loving
homes to children who lost their parents on December 26th. One will be
constructed in Pondicherry Town on India&#x2019;s east coast, and will become
home for 140 children. Construction is beginning this month and the
village will be completed in 2007. The second will be built in Port
Blair on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands: land allocation is currently
underway.</p>
<p>As well as rebuilding homes and villages, SOS
Children runs <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Schools.htm">education programmes</a> for both children and adults so
people can have a better quality of life. In Murtypudukuppam, a village
near Pondicherry Town, we have been running tailoring and handiwork
classes for women, and primary education classes for children. Work on
permanent facilities for these classes will be completed shortly. In
the Karaikal District a day care centre offers young children play
activities, trauma counselling for those affected by the tsunami and
hot meals, while their parents are out at work. A vocational training
centre will be constructed on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to
provide the teenagers there with the skills needed by the local labour
market. Young children will also benefit from a brand new <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Schools.htm">SOS nursery
school</a>.</p>
<p>In the towns where SOS Children has undertaken
extensive reconstruction programmes, there are SOS community centres
which run adult education classes and also have medical and day care
facilities. <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Medical_Centres.htm">Medical services</a> include community nurses and a dispensary.
After the community centres have been fully constructed, they will be
handed over to the local communities to manage and run.</p>
<h3>Return to Normality<br /></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life is gradually coming back to normal. <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Soschildrensvillages.htm">SOS Children</a>&#x2019;s work in the tsunami-affected areas of Southern <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/i/India_A.htm">India</a>.&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p>The
calm and serene life in the coastal belts of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry
was shattered by the devastating Tsunami which struck the coastal belts
of both the states in the morning of 26 December 2004 and left behind a
trail of destruction of human life, property and standing crops. The
magnitude of the damages was such that it caught everyone napping
including the local administration. Initial reports in visual media
reported a grim situation in Chennai and Pondicherry state. It was only
late in the night of 26 December that the reports of destruction from
Nagapattinam and Kanyakumari started pouring in and everyone realised
the intensity of the catastrophe. It took the better part of a
fortnight to assess the actual damages to houses, boats, livestock and
most important the loss of human lives.</p>
<p>SOS Children joined the
<a title="SOS Emergency Relief Appeals" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/e/Emergency_Appeal.htm">relief work </a>during the morning of 28 December 2004. The ground
realities in Nagapattinam and Velankanni were very tough and testing.
The whole place resembled a battlefield - bodies lying all over the
place - it was a gory sight. The beaches which were, until a couple of
days earlier, places full of mirth and joy both for the locals as well
as the tourists became a graveyard with human corpses scattering the
ground. The towns of Nagapattinam and Velankanni were deserted;
survivors had fled for their lives. There were heart rending scenes
everywhere. A newly married woman lost her husband on the second day of
marriage and another woman had lost her all her children and husband in
the tsunami. Thousands of people were seen fleeing from Nagapattinam
and Velankanni with their surviving family members and belongings on
their head.</p>
<p>There was shortage of food, medicines, clothing and
other essential items. Mass looting of shops in the city of
Nagapattinam meant that all the shops were closed until the first week
of January. Entire villages had been wiped out. A 30 tonne boat was
found tossed 3 km inland due to the tsunami. Every time a vehicle
stopped the people surrounded the vehicle begging for food. Most of the
children and elders looked malnourished due to hunger and starvation.
There was expectancy in their looks when someone came forward. Everyone
had a sad story to tell. Life in the few days and weeks was
disorganised and nomadic for almost everyone. People were asked to
vacate their villages fearing the outbreak of an epidemic. They were
put in transit camps.</p>
<p>The living conditions for our staff in
Nagapattinam were very difficult in the first couple of months, with
the district administration evacuating the entire population to nearby
towns of Thiruvarur. The water became contaminated and the atmosphere
was full of the stench of human deaths. Even the use of tonnes of
bleaching powder and the use of face masks could not get rid of the
feeling of extreme nausea and giddiness in the initial few days. Water,
food and accommodation became very difficult in the first few weeks.
Travel and communication was also difficult in the initial days.</p>
<p>SOS
Children India started 16 child protection centres
starting from Pondichery to Kanyakumari including the worst affected
districts of Nagapattinam and Cuddalore of Tamil Nadu. Besides the
distribution of food, various activities were organised to help the
children to overcome their trauma and health camps were set up. After
one month of such activities, longer term efforts were put into action
to enable not only the relief, but also rehabilitation and
re-construction programmes that were so vital for the area. To help
families rebuild their lives, one thousand families in six villages of
Tamil Nadu and Pondichery were helped through the provision of
temporary shelters, provisions for three months and utensils. 238
mechanised boats complete with nets were given to groups of families.
Seven children&#x2019;s parks, four day care centres and construction of more
than 500 permanent houses have been undertaken in the affected
villages.</p>
<p>SOS Children has also supported almost 2,000
children, from 900 families, with their education, nutrition and
health. Three main multipurpose activity centres and four satellite
centres are in operation in affected villages and a temporary SOS
Children&#x2019;s Village, based in a rented house in Pondichery, currently
provides a home for 26 children. The task of identifying needy families
to receive support and start up grants was undertaken with the
participation of the local communities themselves and volunteers have
assisted in the running of activities for the children.</p>
<p>Life is
gradually coming back to normal in all the villages and fishing
activity has resumed. Children are going to school equipped with school
bags and other stationary items and are all excited about moving into
the permanent houses in the near future. They are looking forward to
the future with renewed hope and enthusiasm. Activities to help
children overcome their trauma, child care, construction of sanitary
facilities and temporary shelters are among the activities SOS Children
has undertaken with the support of other NGOs. The local government has
been very co-operative and has participated with SOS Children in its
tsunami relief and rehabilitation work, in particular in helping with
the reestablishment of infrastructure in the affected areas.</p>
<p>SOS Children completed all of our emergency relief work post tsunami without funding from DEC, BBC or other "mass" appeals. Our <a title="SOS Emergency Relief Appeals" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/e/Emergency_Appeal.htm">emergency relief programs</a> were funded in large part by existing long term supporters, <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sponsor_A_Child_A.htm">child sponsors</a> and major donors. We are particular indebted to people who took out six month <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sponsor_A_Child_A.htm">emergency relief sponsorships </a>often while waiting for the position of tsunami orphans to become clear. &nbsp;</p>
