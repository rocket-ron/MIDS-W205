       <p><b>Alexander Graham Bell</b> (<!--del_lnk--> 3 March <a href="../../wp/1/1847.htm" title="1847">1847</a> &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 2 August <a href="../../wp/1/1922.htm" title="1922">1922</a>) was an eminent <!--del_lnk--> scientist, <!--del_lnk--> inventor and <!--del_lnk--> innovator who is widely credited with the invention of the <a href="../../wp/t/Telephone.htm" title="Telephone">telephone</a>. His father, grandfather and brother had all been associated with work on <!--del_lnk--> elocution and <!--del_lnk--> speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices that eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the invention of the telephone in 1876.</p>
       <p>Many other inventions marked Bell's later life including <!--del_lnk--> groundbreaking work in <!--del_lnk--> hydrofoils and <!--del_lnk--> aeronautics. In 1888, Alexander Graham Bell became one of the founding members of the <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic Society. In reflection, Bell considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study. Upon Bell's death, all telephones throughout the United States "stilled their ringing for a silent minute in tribute to the man whose yearning to communicate made them possible."</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_years">Early years</span></h2>
       <p>Alexander Bell was born in <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> on <!--del_lnk--> March 3 <a href="../../wp/1/1847.htm" title="1847">1847</a>. Throughout his early life, Bell was a British subject. The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, Edinburgh, Scotland, and now has a commemorative marker at the doorstep, marking it as Alexander Graham Bell's birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell (1845&ndash;1870) and Edward Charles Bell (1848&ndash;1867). Both of his brothers died of <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, Edward in 1867 and Melville in 1870. His father was Professor <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Melville Bell, and his mother was Eliza Grace(nee Symonds). Although he was born "Alexander", at age ten, he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers. For his 11th birthday, his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the middle name "Graham" chosen out of admiration for Alexander Graham, a Canadian being treated by his father and boarder who had become a family friend. To close relatives and friends he remained "Alec" which his father continued to call him into later life.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_invention">First invention</span></h3>
       <p>As a child, young Aleck Bell displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering <a href="../../wp/b/Botany.htm" title="Botany">botanical</a> specimens as well as <!--del_lnk--> experimenting even at an early age. His best friend was Ben Herdman, a neighbour whose family operated a flour <!--del_lnk--> mill, the scene of many forays. When their typical child's play had caused a racket one day, John Herdman admonished the two boys, "Why don't you do something useful?" Young Aleck asked what needed to be done at the mill. He was told <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a> had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking <!--del_lnk--> machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years.  In return, John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop to "invent."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_work_with_speech">Early work with speech</span></h3>
       <p>From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist. Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he revelled in mimicry and "voice tricks" akin to ventriloquism that constantly entertained family guests. Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour. He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity. Bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study <!--del_lnk--> acoustics.</p>
       <p>His family was long associated with the teaching of <!--del_lnk--> elocution: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, his uncle in <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his <i>The Standard Elocutionist</i> (1860) and <!--del_lnk--> treatise on <i><!--del_lnk--> Visible Speech</i>, which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. <i>The Standard Elocutionist</i> appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct <!--del_lnk--> deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Aleck's father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but also to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound. Aleck became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities in deciphering <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic and even <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> symbols.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h3>
       <p>As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father. At an early age, however, he was enrolled at the <!--del_lnk--> Royal High School, Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at age 15, completing the first four forms only. His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades. His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father. Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell. During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself. At age 16, Bell secured a position as a "pupil-teacher" of <!--del_lnk--> elocution and music, in Weston House Academy, at <!--del_lnk--> Elgin, <!--del_lnk--> Moray, Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and &pound;10 per session. The following year, he attended the <!--del_lnk--> University of Edinburgh; joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_experiments_with_sound">First experiments with sound</span></h3>
       <p>Bell's father encouraged Aleck's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique <!--del_lnk--> automaton, developed by Sir <!--del_lnk--> Charles Wheatstone based on the earlier work of <!--del_lnk--> Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen. The rudimentary "mechanical man" simulated a human voice. Aleck was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a "big prize" if they were successful. While his brother constructed the <!--del_lnk--> throat and <!--del_lnk--> larynx, Aleck tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic <!--del_lnk--> skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could "<!--del_lnk--> speak," albeit only a few words. The boys would carefully adjust the "<!--del_lnk--> lips" and when a <!--del_lnk--> bellows forced air through the <!--del_lnk--> windpipe, a very recognizable "Mama" ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention.</p>
       <p>Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's Skye terrier, "Trouve". After he taught it to growl continuously, Aleck would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and <!--del_lnk--> vocal cords to produce a crude-sounding "Ow ah oo ga ma ma." With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate "How are you grandma?" More indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a "talking dog." However, these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of <a href="../../wp/s/Sound.htm" title="Sound">sound</a>, using <!--del_lnk--> tuning forks to explore <!--del_lnk--> resonance. At the age of 19, he wrote a report on his work and sent it to Alexander Ellis, a colleague of his father. Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Dismayed to find that <!--del_lnk--> groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by <!--del_lnk--> Hermann von Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork "<!--del_lnk--> contraption", he pored over the German scientist's book, <i>Sensations of Tone</i>. From his translation of the original German edition, Aleck then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, "Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if <a href="../../wp/v/Vowel.htm" title="Vowel">vowel</a> sounds could be produced by <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electrical</a> means so could <a href="../../wp/c/Consonant.htm" title="Consonant">consonants</a>, so could <!--del_lnk--> articulate speech."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Family_tragedy">Family tragedy</span></h3>
       <p>In 1865, when the Bell family moved to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment. Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a <!--del_lnk--> telegraph wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend. Throughout the fall and winter, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward "Ted," was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as "A.G. Bell") and served the next year as an instructor at <!--del_lnk--> Somerset College, <a href="../../wp/b/Bath%252C_Somerset.htm" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Somerset, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's passing, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother, "Melly" had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at the <!--del_lnk--> University College London, Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.</p>
       <p>Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's private school for the deaf in <!--del_lnk--> South Kensington, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. His first two pupils were "deaf mute" girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870, Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis. His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland. Bell's parents precipitated a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly. Making a swift judgement, Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property, conclude all of his brother's affairs (Bell took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp), and join his father and mother in setting out for the "<!--del_lnk--> New World." Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Canada">Canada</span></h2>
       <p>In 1870, at age 23, Bell, his brother's widow, Caroline (Margaret Ottaway), and his parents travelled on the <i>SS Nestorian</i> to Canada. After landing at Quebec City, the Bells boarded a train to <a href="../../wp/m/Montreal.htm" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> and later to <!--del_lnk--> Paris, Ontario to stay with the Reverend Thomas Henderson, a family friend. After a brief stay with the Hendersons, the Bell family purchased a ten and a half acre farm at Tutelo Heights (now called Tutela Heights), near <!--del_lnk--> Brantford, <!--del_lnk--> Ontario. The property consisted of an orchard, larger farm house, stable, pigsty, hen-house and a carriage house, which bordered the <!--del_lnk--> Grand River.</p>
       <p>At the homestead, Bell set up his own workshop in the converted <!--del_lnk--> carriage house near to what he called his "dreaming place," a large hollow, nestled in trees at the back of the property, above the river. Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada, Bell found the climate and environs to his liking, and rapidly improved. He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the <!--del_lnk--> Six Nations Reserve across the river at <!--del_lnk--> Onondaga, he learned the Mohawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols. For his work, Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a <!--del_lnk--> Mohawk headdress and danced traditional dances.</p>
       <p>After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on Helmholtz's work with electricity and sound. He designed a <a href="../../wp/p/Piano.htm" title="Piano">piano</a>, which, by means of electricity, could transmit its music at a distance. Once the family was settled in, both Bell and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871, he accompanied his father to Montreal, where Melville was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_with_the_deaf">Work with the deaf</span></h2>
       <p>Subsequently, his father was invited by Sarah Fuller, principal of the <!--del_lnk--> Boston School for Deaf Mutes (which continues today as the public <!--del_lnk--> Horace Mann School for the Deaf), in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Boston.htm" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts, <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fuller's instructors, but he declined the post, in favour of his son. Travelling to Boston in April 1871, Bell provided a successful inservicing of the school's instructors. He was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the <!--del_lnk--> American Asylum for Deaf-mutes in <!--del_lnk--> Hartford and the <!--del_lnk--> Clarke School for the Deaf in <!--del_lnk--> Northampton.</p>
       <p>Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his experiments with his "harmonic telegraph."The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver as needed. Unsure of his future, he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher. His father helped him set up his private practise by contacting <!--del_lnk--> Gardiner Greene Hubbard, the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation. Teaching his father's system, in October 1872, Alexander Bell opened a school in Boston named the "Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech" which attracted a large number of deaf pupils. His first class numbered 30 students. Working as a private tutor, one of his most famous pupils was <a href="../../wp/h/Helen_Keller.htm" title="Helen Keller">Helen Keller</a>, who came to him as a young child, unable to see, hear or speak. She later was to say that Bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that "inhuman silence which separates and estranges."</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Continuing_experimentation">Continuing experimentation</span></h2>
       <p>In the following year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the <!--del_lnk--> Boston University School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was "swept up" by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors resident in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house. Keeping up "<!--del_lnk--> night owl" hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover. Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches. Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell only retained two students, six-year old "Georgie" Sanders, deaf from birth and 15-year old Mabel Hubbard. Each pupil would serve to play an important role in the next developments. George's father, Thomas Sanders, a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay at nearby <!--del_lnk--> Salem with Georgie's grandmother, complete with a room to "experiment." Although the offer was made by George's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together with free room and board thrown in. Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years his junior but became the object of Bell's affection. Losing her hearing after a bout of <!--del_lnk--> scarlet fever at age five, she had learned to read lips but her father, Gardiner Greene Hubbard, Bell's <!--del_lnk--> benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Telephone">Telephone</span></h2>
       <p>By 1874, Bell's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage with progress it made both at his new Boston "laboratory" (a rented facility) as well as at his family home in Canada a big success.. While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a "phonautograph," a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations. Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves. Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulatory currents back into sound. But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.</p>
       <p>In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of <!--del_lnk--> Western Union President William Orton, had become "the nervous system of commerce." Orton had contracted with inventors <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Edison.htm" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Elisha Gray to find a way to send multiple <!--del_lnk--> telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines. When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments. Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's patent attorney, Anthony Pollok.</p>
       <p>In March 1875, Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Henry, who was then director of the <!--del_lnk--> Smithsonian Institution, and asked Henry's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph. Henry replied that Bell had "the germ of a great invention". When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, "Get it!" That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas A. Watson, an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of <!--del_lnk--> Charles Williams, changed all that.</p>
       <p>With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell was able to hire Thomas Watson as his assistant and the two of them experimented with <!--del_lnk--> acoustic telegraphy. On <!--del_lnk--> 2 June <a href="../../wp/1/1875.htm" title="1875">1875</a>, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the "<!--del_lnk--> gallows" sound-powered telephone, which was able to transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.</p>

       <p>Meanwhile, Elisha Gray was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter. On <!--del_lnk--> 14 February <a href="../../wp/1/1876.htm" title="1876">1876</a>, Gray filed a <!--del_lnk--> caveat with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed an application with the patent office for the telephone. There is a debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent.</p>
       <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 14 February <a href="../../wp/1/1876.htm" title="1876">1876</a>, Bell was in Boston. Hubbard, who was paying the costs of Bell's patents, told his patent lawyer, Anthony Pollok, to file Bell's application in the U.S. Patent Office. This was done without Bell's knowledge. Patent Number 174,465 was issued to Bell on <!--del_lnk--> 7 March <a href="../../wp/1/1876.htm" title="1876">1876</a> by the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Patent Office which covered "the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically&hellip; by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound."</p>
       <p>Three days after his patent was issued, Bell experimented with a water transmitter, using an acid-water mixture. Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water which varied the electrical resistance in the circuit. When Bell spoke the famous sentence "Mr Watson &mdash; Come here &mdash; I want to see you" into the liquid transmitter, Watson, listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.</p>
       <p>Bell's successful test of Gray's water transmitter design provided a <!--del_lnk--> proof of concept experiment that proved to Bell's satisfaction that clear human voice sounds could be electrically transmitted. After that, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and did not use a water transmitter in public demonstrations or in commercial applications.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Later_developments">Later developments</span></h3>
       <p>Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought a working model of his telephone home. On <!--del_lnk--> 3 August <a href="../../wp/1/1876.htm" title="1876">1876</a>, from the telegraph office in <!--del_lnk--> Mount Pleasant five miles (eight km) away from Brantford, Alexander sent a tentative telegram indicating he was ready. With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines, fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing. These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.</p>
       <p>Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy. Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25 million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent. Bell's investors would become <!--del_lnk--> millionaires while he fared well from residuals and he, at one point, had assets nearly reaching one million dollars.</p>
       <p>Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures in order to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public. Only one day after his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 Centenary Exhibition in <a href="../../wp/p/Philadelphia.htm" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> made the telephone the featured headline worldwide. Influential visitors to the exhibition included <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, and later Bell had the opportunity to personally demonstrate the invention to <!--del_lnk--> William Thomson, a renowned Scottish scientist and even <a href="../../wp/q/Queen_Victoria.htm" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> who had requested a private audience at <!--del_lnk--> Osborne House, her <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a> home; she called the demonstration "most extraordinary." The enthusiasm that surrounded Bell's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, and by 1886, over 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one of the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the <!--del_lnk--> carbon microphone from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for long distances, unlike Bell's voice-powered transmitter that required users to shout into it to be heard at the receiving telephone, even at short distances. On <!--del_lnk--> 25 January <a href="../../wp/1/1915.htm" title="1915">1915</a>, Alexander Graham Bell sent the first transcontinental telephone call, at 15 Day Street in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, which was received by <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Watson at 333 Grant Avenue in <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco.htm" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> New York Times reported: "On October 9, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Watson talked by telephone to each other over a two-mile (3 km) wire stretched between Cambridge and Boston. It was the first wire conversation ever held. Yesterday afternoon [on January 25, 1915] the same two men talked by telephone to each other over a 3,400-mile (5,500&nbsp;km) wire between New York and San Francisco. Dr. Bell, the veteran inventor of the telephone, was in New York, and Mr. Watson, his former associate, was on the other side of the continent. They heard each other much more distinctly than they did in their first talk thirty-eight years ago."</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Competitors">Competitors</span></h3>
       <p>As is sometimes common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous developments can occur, as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone. Over a period of 18 years, the Bell Telephone Company faced over 600 litigations posing legal challenges concerning the rights to the telephone, but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent  and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage. Bell's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments. The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off a myriad of lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by Elisha Gray and <!--del_lnk--> Amos Dolbear. In personal correspondence to Bell, both Gray and Dolbear had acknowledged his prior work, which considerably weakened their later claims.</p>
       <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 13 January <a href="../../wp/1/1887.htm" title="1887">1887</a>, the United States Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation. After a series of decisions and reversals, the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court, though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided.  By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles, the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents (No. 174,46 and dated <!--del_lnk--> 7 March <a href="../../wp/1/1876.htm" title="1876">1876</a> and No. 186,787 dated <!--del_lnk--> 30 January <a href="../../wp/1/1877.htm" title="1877">1877</a>) were no longer in effect, although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case's importance as a <!--del_lnk--> "precedent." With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest (on both sides) arising from the original trial, the U.S. Attorney General dropped the law suit on <!--del_lnk--> 30 November <a href="../../wp/1/1897.htm" title="1897">1897</a> leaving several issues undecided on the merits.</p>
       <p>During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Italian inventor <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Meucci also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> in 1834. In 1886, in the first of three cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's evidence in this case was disputed due to lack of material evidence of his inventions as his working models were reportedly lost at the Western Union laboratory. Meucci's work, like many other inventors of the period, was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments, the final case involving Meucci was eventually dropped upon Meucci's death. However, due to the efforts of Congressman <!--del_lnk--> Vito Fossella, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="U.S. House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 11 June <a href="../../wp/2/2002.htm" title="2002">2002</a> stated that Meucci's "work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged," even though this did not put an end to a still contentious issue. Most modern scholars do not recognize the claims that Bell's work on the telephone was influenced by Meucci's inventions. </p>
       <p>The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world with patent applications made in most major countries, but when Bell had delayed the German patent application, the electrical firm of <!--del_lnk--> Siemens &amp; Halske (S&amp;H) managed to set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent. The Siemens company produced near-identical copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay royalties. A series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation. The strain on Bell by his constant appearances in court, necessitated by the legal battles, eventually resulted in his resignation from the company.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Family_life">Family life</span></h2>
       <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 11 July <a href="../../wp/1/1877.htm" title="1877">1877</a>, a few days after the <!--del_lnk--> Bell Telephone Company was established, Bell married <!--del_lnk--> Mabel Hubbard (1857&ndash;1923) at the Hubbard estate in <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge, and shortly thereafter, embarked on a year-long honeymoon in Europe. During that excursion, Alec took a handmade model of his telephone with him, making it a "working holiday." Although the courtship had begun years earlier, Alexander waited until he was financially secure before marrying. Although the telephone appeared to be an "instant" success, it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell's main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897. One unusual request exacted by his fianc&eacute;e was that he use "Alec" rather than the family's earlier familiar name of "Aleck." From 1876, he would sign his name "Alec Bell." They had four children: Elsie May Bell (1878&ndash;1964) who married <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert Grosvenor of <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic fame, Marian Hubbard Bell (1880&ndash;1962) who was referred to as "Daisy", and two sons who died in infancy.</p>
       <p>In 1882, Bell became a <!--del_lnk--> naturalized citizen of the United States. The Bell family maintained a residence in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a>, where Alec set up a laboratory. In 1915, he characterized his status as: "I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries." Despite this declaration, Bell has been claimed as a "native son" by <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, Scotland and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated. That summer, the Bells had a vacation on <!--del_lnk--> Cape Breton Island in <!--del_lnk--> Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of <!--del_lnk--> Baddeck. Returning in 1886, Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking <!--del_lnk--> Bras d'Or Lake. By 1889, a large house, christened "The Lodge" was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings were begun that the Bells would name <i><!--del_lnk--> Beinn Bhreagh</i>(Gaelic: <i>beautiful</i> <i>mountain</i>) after Alec's ancestral Scottish highlands. Bell would spend his final, and some of his most productive, years in residence in both Washington, D.C. and <!--del_lnk--> Beinn Bhreagh.</p>
       <p>Until the end of his life, Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes, but <i>Beinn Bhreagh</i> would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that annual stays lengthened. Both Mabel and Alec became immersed in the Baddeck community and were accepted by the villagers as "their own." The Bells were still in residence at <i>Beinn Bhreagh</i> when the <!--del_lnk--> Halifax Explosion occurred on <!--del_lnk--> 6 December <a href="../../wp/1/1917.htm" title="1917">1917</a>. Mabel and Alec mobilized the community to help victims in Halifax.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Later_inventions">Later inventions</span></h2>
       <p>Although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied. According to his biographer, Charlotte Gray, Bell's work ranged "unfettered across the scientific landscape" and he often went to bed voraciously reading the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, scouring it for new areas of interest. The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the <!--del_lnk--> photophone, one for the <!--del_lnk--> phonograph, five for aerial vehicles, four for "hydroairplanes" and two for <a href="../../wp/s/Selenium.htm" title="Selenium">selenium</a> cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the <!--del_lnk--> audiometer to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding alternative fuels.</p>
       <p>Bell worked extensively in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. During his Volta Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they were unable to develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the <!--del_lnk--> tape recorder, the <!--del_lnk--> hard disc and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Floppy_disk.htm" title="Floppy disc">floppy disc</a> drive and other <!--del_lnk--> magnetic media.</p>
       <p>Bell's own home used a primitive form of <!--del_lnk--> air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. <a href="../../wp/m/Methane.htm" title="Methane">Methane</a> gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with <!--del_lnk--> composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using <!--del_lnk--> solar panels to heat houses.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Metal_detector">Metal detector</span></h3>
       <p>Bell is also credited with the invention of the <!--del_lnk--> metal detector in 1881. The device was hurriedly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">U.S. President</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/James_A._Garfield.htm" title="James Garfield">James Garfield</a>. The metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame the President was lying on disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. The president's surgeons, who were sceptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternately, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus. Bell gave a full account of his experiments in a paper read before the <!--del_lnk--> American Association for the Advancement of Science(AAAS) in August 1882.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The March 1906 <i><!--del_lnk--> Scientific American</i> article by American <!--del_lnk--> hydrofoil pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of <!--del_lnk--> hydrofoils and <!--del_lnk--> hydroplanes. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell and assistant <!--del_lnk--> Frederick W. "Casey" Baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor <!--del_lnk--> Enrico Forlanini and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.</p>
       <p>During his world tour of 1910&ndash;1911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over <!--del_lnk--> Lake Maggiore. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the <i>Dhonnas Beag</i>, the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil. The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial HD-4, powered by <!--del_lnk--> Renault engines. A top speed of 54 miles per hour (87&nbsp;km/h) was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty. In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in Westmount, Nova Scotia to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near <!--del_lnk--> Baddeck, Nova Scotia. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a>, work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two 350 <!--del_lnk--> horsepower (260&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kW) engines in July 1919. On <!--del_lnk--> 9 September <a href="../../wp/1/1919.htm" title="1919">1919</a>, the HD-4 set a world's marine speed record of 70.86 miles per hour (114.04&nbsp;km/h). This record stood for ten years.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Bell was a supporter of aerospace engineering research through the <!--del_lnk--> Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of Mrs. Mabel Bell and with her financial support. The AEA was headed by Bell and the founding members were four young men: American <!--del_lnk--> Glenn H. Curtiss, a motorcycle manufacturer who later was awarded the Scientific American Trophy for the first official one-kilometre flight in the <!--del_lnk--> Western hemisphere and became a world-renowned airplane manufacturer; <!--del_lnk--> Frederick W. Baldwin, the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in <!--del_lnk--> Hammondsport, New York; <!--del_lnk--> J.A.D. McCurdy; and Lieutenant <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Selfridge, an official observer from the U.S. government. In 1891, Bell began experiments to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft.</p>
       <p>In 1898, Bell experimented with <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tetrahedron.htm" title="Tetrahedral">tetrahedral</a> <!--del_lnk--> box kites and wings constructed of multiple compound <!--del_lnk--> tetrahedral kites covered in silk. The tetrahedral wings were named <i>Cygnet</i> I, II and III, and were flown both unmanned and manned (<i>Cygnet I</i> crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge) in the period from 1907&ndash;1912. Some of Bell's kites are on display at the <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site.</p>
       <p>The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders. Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Red Wing</i>, framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air-cooled engine. On <!--del_lnk--> 12 March <a href="../../wp/1/1908.htm" title="1908">1908</a>, over <!--del_lnk--> Keuka Lake, the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America. The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder (later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control). One of the AEA project's inventions, the <!--del_lnk--> aileron, is a standard component of aircraft today. (The aileron was also invented independently by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Esnault-Pelterie.) The <i>White Wing</i> and <i>June Bug</i> were to follow and by the end of 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished. However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $10,000 grant from Mrs. Bell allowed it to continue with experiments.</p>
       <p>Their final aircraft design, the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Silver Dart</i> embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines. On <!--del_lnk--> 23 February <a href="../../wp/1/1909.htm" title="1909">1909</a>, Bell was present as the <i>Silver Dart</i> flown by J.A.D. McCurdy from the frozen ice of Bras d'Or, made the first aircraft flight in Canada. Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand. With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the <i>Silver Dart</i> would revert to Baldwin and McCurdy who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the Canadian Army.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Eugenics">Eugenics</span></h2>
       <p>Along with many very prominent thinkers and scientists of the time, Bell was connected with the <!--del_lnk--> eugenics movement in the United States. In his lecture <i>Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race</i> presented to the <!--del_lnk--> National Academy of Sciences on <!--del_lnk--> 13 November <a href="../../wp/1/1883.htm" title="1883">1883</a> he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry. However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist <!--del_lnk--> David Starr Jordan's Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the <!--del_lnk--> American Breeders Association. The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man. From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the <!--del_lnk--> Eugenics Record Office associated with <!--del_lnk--> Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory in <!--del_lnk--> New York, and regularly attended meetings. In 1921, he was the honorary president of the <!--del_lnk--> Second International Congress of Eugenics held under the auspices of the <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History in New York. Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the <!--del_lnk--> compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a "defective variety of the human race". By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and the <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> laws were used as a model for eugenics laws in <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Awards.2C_honors_and_tributes">Awards, honours and tributes</span></h2>
       <p>In 1880, Bell received the <!--del_lnk--> Volta Prize of 50,000 francs ($10,000) for the invention of the telephone from L&rsquo;<!--del_lnk--> Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise, representing the French government, in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Among the luminaries who judged were <a href="../../wp/v/Victor_Hugo.htm" title="Victor Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Alexandre Dumas, p&egrave;re. The Volta Prize was established by Napoleon Banaparte in 1803 to honour <!--del_lnk--> Alessandro Volta, an Italian physicist noted for developing the battery. (The modern usage of the word "<a href="../../wp/v/Volt.htm" title="Volt">volt</a>" is derived from his name.) Since he was reaching affluent circumstances himself, Bell used the money from the Prize to create a number of social structures in and around Washington, D.C. using the symbolic "Volta": the "Volta Fund," "Volta Laboratories" and "Volta Bureau."</p>
       <p>In partnership with Gardiner Hubbard, Bell established the publication <i>Science</i> in 1883. In 1888, Bell was one of the founding members of the <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic Society and became its second president (1897&ndash;1904) and Regent of the <!--del_lnk--> Smithsonian Institution (1898&ndash;1922). He was the recipient of many honours. The <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> government conferred on him the decoration of the <!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;gion d'honneur (Legion of Honour); the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the <!--del_lnk--> Albert Medal in 1902; and the <!--del_lnk--> University of W&uuml;rzburg, <!--del_lnk--> Bavaria, granted him a Ph.D. He was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> AIEE's <!--del_lnk--> Edison Medal in 1914 "For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone."</p>
       <p>The bel (B) is a unit of measurement invented by <!--del_lnk--> Bell Labs and named after Bell. The bel was too large for everyday use, so the <!--del_lnk--> decibel (dB), equal to 0.1 B, became more commonly used as a unit for measuring sound intensity.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> IEEE's <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Graham Bell Medal has been presented since 1976 to an individual or team, honoring outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications.</p>
