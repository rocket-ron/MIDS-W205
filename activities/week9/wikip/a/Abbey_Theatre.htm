       <p>The <b>Abbey Theatre</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Irish: <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga"><i>Amharclann na Mainistreach</i></span>), also known as the <b>National Theatre of Ireland</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Irish: <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga"><i>Amharclann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann</i></span>), is a <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theatre">theatre</a> located in <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a>. The Abbey first opened its doors to the public on 27 December 1904. Despite losing its original building to a fire in 1951, it has remained active to the present day. The Abbey was the first state-subsidized theatre in the English-speaking world; from 1925 onwards it received an annual subsidy from the <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_Free_State.htm" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a>. Since July 1966, the Abbey has been located at 26 Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1.</p>
       <p>In its early years, the theatre was closely associated with the writers of the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Literary Revival, many of whom were involved in its founding and most of whom had plays staged there. The Abbey served as a nursery for many of the leading <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_theatre.htm" title="Irish theatre">Irish playwrights</a> and actors of the 20th century, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/W._B._Yeats.htm" title="William Butler Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Augusta%252C_Lady_Gregory.htm" title="Augusta, Lady Gregory">Augusta, Lady Gregory</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Sean O'Casey and <!--del_lnk--> John Millington Synge. In addition, through its extensive programme of touring abroad and its high visibility to foreign, particularly American, audiences, it has become an important part of the <!--del_lnk--> Irish tourist industry.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The Abbey arose from three distinct bases, the first of which was the seminal <!--del_lnk--> Irish Literary Theatre. Founded by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Augusta%252C_Lady_Gregory.htm" title="Isabella Augusta Gregory">Lady Gregory</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Edward Martyn and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/W._B._Yeats.htm" title="W.B.Yeats">W.B.Yeats</a> in 1899&mdash;with assistance from <!--del_lnk--> George Moore&mdash;it presented plays in the Ancient Concert Rooms and the <!--del_lnk--> Gaiety Theatre, which brought critical approval but limited public interest.</p>
       <p>The second base involved the work of two Irish brothers, <!--del_lnk--> William and <!--del_lnk--> Frank Fay. William worked in the 1890s with a touring company in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, while Frank was heavily involved in amateur dramatics in Dublin. After William returned to Dublin, the Fay brothers staged productions in halls around the city and eventually formed <!--del_lnk--> W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company, focused on the development of Irish acting talent. In April 1902, the Fays gave three performances of <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;'s play <i>Deirdre</i> and Yeats' <i>Cathleen N&iacute; Houlihan</i> in a hall in St. Theresa's Hall on Clarendon Street. The performances played to a mainly working-class audience rather than the usual middle-class Dublin theatregoers. The run was a great success, thanks in part to <!--del_lnk--> Maud Gonne, who played the lead in Yeats' play. The company continued at the Ancient Concert Rooms, producing works by <!--del_lnk--> Seumas O'Cuisin, <!--del_lnk--> Fred Ryan and Yeats.</p>
       <p>The third base was financial support and experience of <!--del_lnk--> Annie Horniman. Horniman was a middle-class Englishwoman with previous experience of theatre production, having been involved in the presentation of <!--del_lnk--> George Bernard Shaw's <i><!--del_lnk--> Arms and the Man</i> in London in 1894. She came to Dublin in 1903 to act as Yeats' unpaid secretary and to make costumes for a production of his play <i>The King's Threshold</i>. Her money helped found the Abbey Theatre and, according to the critic Adrian Frazier, would "make the rich feel at home, and the poor&mdash;on a first visit&mdash;out of place."</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Encouraged by the St Theresa's Hall success, Yeats, Lady Gregory, &AElig;, Martyn, and <!--del_lnk--> John Millington Synge founded the Irish National Theatre Society in 1903 with funding from Horniman. They were joined by actors and playwrights from Fay's company. At first, they staged performances in the Molesworth Hall. When the <!--del_lnk--> Mechanics' Theatre in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in Marlborough Street became available after fire safety authorities closed it, Horniman and William Fay agreed to buy and refit the space to meet the society's needs.</p>
       <p>On 11 May 1904, the society formally accepted Horniman's offer of the use of the building. As Horniman did not usually reside in Ireland, the royal <!--del_lnk--> letters patent required were granted in the name of Lady Gregory, although paid for by Horniman. The founders appointed William Fay theatre manager, responsible for training the actors in the newly established repertory company. They commissioned Yeats' brother <!--del_lnk--> Jack to paint portraits of all the leading figures in the society for the foyer, and hired <!--del_lnk--> Sarah Purser to design stained glass for the same space.</p>
       <p>On 27 December, the curtains went up on opening night. The bill consisted of three one-act plays, <i>On Baile's Strand</i> and <i>Cathleen N&iacute; Houlihan</i> by Yeats, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Spreading the News</i> by Lady Gregory. On the second night, <i>In the Shadow of the Glen</i> by Synge replaced the second Yeats play. These two bills alternated over a five-night run. Frank Fay, playing <!--del_lnk--> C&uacute;chulainn in <i>On Baile's Strand</i>, was the first actor on the Abbey stage. Although Horniman had designed the costumes, neither she nor Lady Gregory was present. Horniman had returned to England. In addition to providing funding, her chief role with the Abbey over the coming years was to organise publicity and bookings for their touring productions in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and provincial England.</p>
       <p>In 1905 without properly consulting Horniman, Yeats, Lady Gregory and Synge decided to turn the theatre into a <!--del_lnk--> limited liability company, the National Theatre Society Ltd. Annoyed by this treatment, Horniman hired <!--del_lnk--> Ben Iden Payne, a former Abbey employee, to help run a new repertory company which she founded in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester, England">Manchester</a>. Leading actors <!--del_lnk--> M&aacute;ire Nic Shiubhlaigh, Honour Lavelle (Helen Laird), Emma Vernon, M&aacute;ire Garvey, Frank Walker, <!--del_lnk--> Seamus O'Sullivan, <!--del_lnk--> P&aacute;draic Colum and <!--del_lnk--> George Roberts left the Abbey.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_years">Early years</span></h3>
       <p>The new Abbey Theatre found great popular success, and large crowds attended many of its productions. The Abbey was fortunate in having Synge as a key member, as he was then considered one of the foremost English-language dramatists. The theatre staged many plays by eminent or soon-to-be eminent authors, including Yeats, Lady Gregory, Moore, Martyn, <!--del_lnk--> Padraic Colum, <!--del_lnk--> George Bernard Shaw, <!--del_lnk--> Oliver St John Gogarty, <!--del_lnk--> F. R. Higgins, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas MacDonagh, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Dunsany, <!--del_lnk--> T. C. Murray, <!--del_lnk--> James Cousins and <!--del_lnk--> Lennox Robinson. Many of these authors served on the board, and it was during this time that the Abbey gained its reputation as a writers' theatre.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The Abbey's fortunes worsened in January 1907 when the opening of Synge's <i><!--del_lnk--> The Playboy of the Western World</i> resulted in civil disturbance. The troubles (since known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Playboy Riots</i>) were encouraged, in part, by <!--del_lnk--> nationalists who believed the theatre was insufficiently political and who took offence at Synge's use of the word '<!--del_lnk--> shift', as it was known at the time as a symbol representing <!--del_lnk--> Kitty O'Shea and adultery, and hence was seen as a slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood. Much of the crowd rioted loudly, and the actors performed the remainder of the play in <!--del_lnk--> dumbshow. The theatre's decision to call in the police further roused anger of the nationalists. Although press opinion soon turned against the rioters and the protests faded, management of the Abbey was shaken. They chose not to stage Synge's next&mdash;and last completed&mdash;play, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tinker's Wedding</i> (1908), for fear of further disturbances. That same year, the Fay brothers' association with the theatre ended when they emigrated to the United States; Lennox Robinson took over the Abbey's day-to-day management.</p>
       <p>In 1909, Shaw's <i>The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet</i> led to further protests. The subsequent discussion occupied a full issue of the theatre's journal <i>The Arrow</i>. Also that year, the proprietors decided to make the Abbey independent of Annie Horniman, who had indicated a preference for this course. Relations with Horniman had been tense, partly because she wished to be involved in choosing which plays were to be performed and when. As a mark of respect for the death of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Edward_VII.htm" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">King Edward VII</a>, an understanding existed that Dublin theatres were to close on the night of 7 May 1910. Robinson, however, kept the Abbey open. When Horniman heard of Robinson's decision, she severed her connections with the company. By her own estimate, she had invested &pound;10,350&mdash;worth approximately $1 million in 2007 US dollars&mdash;on the project.</p>
       <p>With the loss of Horniman, Synge, and the Fays, the Abbey under Robinson tended to drift, suffering from falling public interest and box office returns. This trend was halted for a time by the emergence of <!--del_lnk--> Sean O'Casey as an heir to Synge. O'Casey's career as a dramatist began with <i>The Shadow of a Gunman</i>, staged by the Abbey in 1923. This was followed by <i>Juno and the Paycock</i> in 1924, and <i>The Plough and the Stars</i> in 1926. Theatregoers arose in riots over the last play, in a way reminiscent of those that had greeted the <i>Playboy</i> 19 years earlier. Concerned about public reaction, the Abbey rejected O'Casey's next play. He emigrated to London shortly thereafter.</p>
       <p>In 1924, Yeats and Lady Gregory offered the Abbey to the government of the Free State as a gift to the Irish people. Although the government refused, the following year Minister of Finance <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Blythe arranged an annual government subsidy of &pound;850 for the Abbey. This made the company the first state-supported theatre in the English-speaking world. The subsidy allowed the theatre to avoid bankruptcy, but the amount was too small to rescue it from financial difficulty.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Affiliated_schools">Affiliated schools</span></h4>
       <p><b>The Abbey School of Acting</b> and <b>The Abbey School of Ballet</b> were set up that year. The latter was led by <!--del_lnk--> Ninette de Valois&mdash;who had provided choreography for a number of Yeats' plays&mdash;and ran until 1933.</p>
       <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Peacock_and_the_Gate">The Peacock and the Gate</span></h4>
       <p>Around this time the company acquired additional space, allowing them to create a small experimental theatre, the <i>Peacock</i>, in the ground floor of the main theatre. In 1928, <!--del_lnk--> Hilton Edwards and <!--del_lnk--> Miche&aacute;l MacLiammoir launched the <!--del_lnk--> Gate Theatre, initially using the Peacock to stage works by European and American dramatists. The Gate primarily sought work from new Irish playwrights and, despite the new space, the Abbey entered a period of artistic decline.</p>
       <p>This is illustrated by the story of how one new work was said to have come to the Gate Theatre. <!--del_lnk--> Denis Johnston reportedly submitted his first play, <i>Shadowdance</i>, to the Abbey; however, Lady Gregory rejected it, returning it to the author with "The Old Lady says No" written across the title page. Johnston decided to re-title the play. The Gate staged <i>The Old Lady Says 'No'</i> in <i>The Peacock</i> in 1928. (Note: academic critics Joseph Ronsley and Christine St. Peter have questioned the veracity of this story.)</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="After_Yeats.27_withdrawal">After Yeats' withdrawal</span></h3>
       <p>The tradition of the Abbey as primarily a writers' theatre survived Yeats' withdrawal from day-to-day involvement. <!--del_lnk--> Frank O'Connor sat on the board from 1935 to 1939, served as managing director from 1937, and had two plays staged during this period. He was alienated from and unable to cope with many of the other board members. They held O'Connor's past adultery against him. Although he fought formidably to retain his position, soon after Yeats died, the board began machinations to remove O'Connor.</p>
       <p>During the 1940s and 1950s, the staple fare at the Abbey was comic farce set in the idealised peasant world of <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;amon de Valera. If it had ever existed, it was no longer considered relevant by most Irish citizens. As a result, audience numbers continued to decline. This drift might have been more dramatic but popular actors, including <!--del_lnk--> F. J. McCormick, and dramatists, including <!--del_lnk--> George Shiels, could still draw a crowd. <!--del_lnk--> Austin Clarke staged events for his Dublin Verse Speaking Society&mdash;later the <!--del_lnk--> Lyric Theatre&mdash;at the Peacock from 1941 to 1944 and the Abbey from 1944 to 1951.</p>
       <p>On 17 July 1951, fire destroyed the Abbey Theatre, with only the Peacock surviving intact. The company leased the old <!--del_lnk--> Queen's Theatre in September and continued in residence there until 1966.</p>
       <p>In February 1961, the ruins of the Abbey were demolished. The board had plans for rebuilding with a design by the Irish architect <!--del_lnk--> Michael Scott. On 3 September 1963, the <!--del_lnk--> President of Ireland, &Eacute;amon de Valera, laid the foundation stone for the new theatre. The Abbey reopened on 18 July 1966.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_years">Recent years</span></h2>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="New_generation">New generation</span></h3>
       <p>A new building; a new generation of dramatists, including such figures as <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Leonard, <!--del_lnk--> Brian Friel and <!--del_lnk--> Tom Murphy; and tourism that included the National Theatre as a key cultural attraction, helped revive the theatre. Beginning in 1957, the theatre's participation in the <!--del_lnk--> Dublin Theatre Festival aided its revival. Plays such as <!--del_lnk--> Brian Friel's <i><!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Here I Come!</i> (1964), <i>The Faith Healer</i> (1979) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Dancing at Lughnasa</i> (1990); <!--del_lnk--> Tom Murphy's <i><!--del_lnk--> A Whistle In the Dark</i> (1961) and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Gigli Concert</i> (1983); and <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Leonard's <i><!--del_lnk--> Da</i> (1973) and <i>A Life</i> (1980), helped raise the Abbey's international profile through successful runs in the <!--del_lnk--> West End in London, and on <!--del_lnk--> Broadway in New York City.</p>
       <p>In December 2004, the theatre celebrated its centenary with events that included performances of the original programme by amateur dramatic groups and a production of Michael West's <i>Dublin By Lamplight</i>, originally staged by Annie Ryan for <!--del_lnk--> The Corn Exchange company at the <!--del_lnk--> Project Arts Centre in November 2004. Despite the centenary, not all was well. Audience numbers were falling; the Peacock was closed for lack of money; the theatre was near bankruptcy, and the staff felt the threat of huge lay-offs.</p>
       <p>In September 2004 two members of the theatre's advisory council, playwrights Jimmy Murphy and <!--del_lnk--> Ulick O'Connor, had tabled a motion of <i>no confidence</i> in Artistic Director Ben Barnes. They criticised Barnes for touring with a play in Australia during the deep financial and artistic crisis at home. Barnes returned and temporarily held his position. The debacle put the Abbey under great public scrutiny. On 12 May 2005, Barnes and Managing Director Brian Jackson resigned after it was found that the theatre's deficit of &euro;1.85&nbsp;million had been underestimated. The new director, <!--del_lnk--> Fiach Mac Conghail, due to start in January 2006, took over in May 2005.</p>
       <p>On 20 August 2005, the Abbey Theatre Advisory Council approved a plan to dissolve the Abbey's owner, the National Theatre Society, and replace it with a <!--del_lnk--> company limited by guarantee, the Abbey Theatre Limited. After strong debate, the board accepted the program. Basing its actions on this plan, the Arts Council of Ireland awarded the Abbey &euro;25.7&nbsp;million in January 2006 to be spread over three years. The grant represented an approximate 43&nbsp;percent increase in the Abbey's revenues and was the largest grant ever awarded by the Arts Council. The new company was established on 1 February 2006, with the announcement of a new Abbey Board chaired by High Court Judge Bryan McMahon. In March 2007, the larger auditorium in the theatre was radically reconfigured by Jean-Guy Lecat as part of a major upgrade of the theatre.</p>
       <p>In 2009, the Literary Department announced the pilot of a new development initiative, the New Playwrights Programme. The six writers taking part in this pilot programme were: <!--del_lnk--> Aidan Harney, Lisa Keogh, Shona McCarthy, Jody O'Neill, Neil Sharpson and Lisa Tierney-Keogh.</p>
       <p>More than 20 writers have been commissioned by the Abbey since Mac&nbsp;Conghail was appointed director in May 2005. The Abbey is also producing new Irish plays commissioned and developed by London's Royal Court Theatre; <!--del_lnk--> Tom Murphy's <i>Alice Trilogy</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Marina Carr's <i>Woman and Scarecrow</i> are examples. The Abbey is also developing a relationship with the <!--del_lnk--> Public Theatre in New York, where it has presented two new plays; <i>Terminus</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Mark O'Rowe and <!--del_lnk--> Sam Shepard's <i>Kicking a Dead Horse</i>.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Development">Development</span></h3>
       <p>After discussions over many years, the Irish government announced in 2007 that a new theatre building would be procured for the Abbey by way of a <!--del_lnk--> public-private partnership contract for design, construction, financing and maintenance. This building will be in Dublin's "Docklands" area and will comprise three auditorium spaces, including a 700-seat main theatre, a 350-seat secondary performance space and a 150-seat studio theatre, along with rehearsal and education facilities, storage, wardrobe, archive and office space, and one or more bars and restaurants and a bookshop.</p>
       <p>The general and artistic operation of the new theatre will continue to be the responsibility of the Abbey Theatre Amharclann na Mainistreach Ltd.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Temporary_closure">Temporary closure</span></h3>
