       <p><b>Addition</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> mathematical operation that represents the total amount of objects together in a collection. It is signified by the <!--del_lnk--> plus sign (+). For example, in the picture on the right, there are 3 + 2 apples&mdash;meaning three apples and two apples together, which is a total of 5 apples. Therefore, 3 + 2 = 5. Besides counting fruits, addition can also represent combining other physical and abstract quantities using different kinds of numbers: <a href="../../wp/n/Negative_number.htm" title="Negative number">negative numbers</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Fraction_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Fraction (mathematics)">fractions</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Irrational_number.htm" title="Irrational number">irrational numbers</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Euclidean_vector.htm" title="Euclidean vector">vectors</a>, decimals and more.</p>
       <p>Addition follows several important patterns. It is <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Commutative_property.htm" title="Commutativity">commutative</a>, meaning that order does not matter, and it is <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Associative_property.htm" title="Associativity">associative</a>, meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, order in which addition is performed does not matter (see <i><!--del_lnk--> Summation</i>). Repeated addition of <a href="../../wp/1/1_%2528number%2529.htm" title="1 (number)">1</a> is the same as <!--del_lnk--> counting; addition of <a href="../../wp/0/0_%2528number%2529.htm" title="0 (number)">0</a> does not change a number. Addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as <a href="../../wp/s/Subtraction.htm" title="Subtraction">subtraction</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Multiplication.htm" title="Multiplication">multiplication</a>. All of these rules can be <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematical_proof.htm" title="Mathematical proof">proven</a>, starting with the addition of natural numbers and generalizing up through the <a href="../../wp/r/Real_number.htm" title="Real number">real numbers</a> and beyond. General <!--del_lnk--> binary operations that continue these patterns are studied in <a href="../../wp/a/Abstract_algebra.htm" title="Abstract algebra">abstract algebra</a>.</p>
       <p>Performing addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, 1 + 1, can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some animals. In <a href="../../wp/p/Primary_education.htm" title="Primary education">primary education</a>, students are taught to add numbers in the <a href="../../wp/d/Decimal.htm" title="Decimal">decimal</a> system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient <a href="../../wp/a/Abacus.htm" title="Abacus">abacus</a> to the modern <a href="../../wp/c/Computer.htm" title="Computer">computer</a>, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Notation_and_terminology">Notation and terminology</span></h2>
       <div class="thumb tright">
       </div>
       <p>Addition is written using the <!--del_lnk--> plus sign "+" between the terms; that is, in <!--del_lnk--> infix notation. The result is expressed with an <!--del_lnk--> equals sign. For example,</p>
       <dl>
        <dd><img alt="1 + 1 = 2 " class="tex" src="../../images/1512/151215.png" /> (verbally, "one plus one equals two")</dd>
        <dd><img alt="2 + 2 = 4 " class="tex" src="../../images/1512/151216.png" /> (verbally, "two plus two equals four")</dd>
        <dd><img alt="3 + 3 = 6 " class="tex" src="../../images/1512/151217.png" /> (verbally, "three plus three equals six")</dd>
        <dd><img alt="5 + 4 + 2 = 11 " class="tex" src="../../images/1512/151218.png" /> (see "associativity" <a href="#Associativity">below</a>)</dd>
        <dd><img alt="3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12" class="tex" src="../../images/1512/151219.png" /> (see "multiplication" <a href="#Related_operations">below</a>)</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>There are also situations where addition is "understood" even though no symbol appears:</p>
       <div class="thumb tright">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/1512/151220.png.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="358" src="../../images/1512/151220.png"  width="220" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

        </div>
       </div>
       <ul>
        <li>A column of numbers, with the last number in the column <!--del_lnk--> underlined, usually indicates that the numbers in the column are to be added, with the sum written below the underlined number.</li>
        <li>A whole number followed immediately by a <a href="../../wp/f/Fraction_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Fraction (mathematics)">fraction</a> indicates the sum of the two, called a <i>mixed number</i>. For example,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&frac12; = 3 + &frac12; = 3.5.<br /> This notation can cause confusion since in most other contexts <!--del_lnk--> juxtaposition denotes <a href="../../wp/m/Multiplication.htm" title="Multiplication">multiplication</a> instead.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The sum of a <!--del_lnk--> series of related numbers can be expressed through <!--del_lnk--> capital sigma notation, which compactly denotes iteration. For example,</p>
       <dl>
        <dd><img alt="\sum_{k=1}^5 k^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 55." class="tex" src="../../images/1512/151224.png" /></dd>
       </dl>
       <p><span id="summand"></span> The numbers or the objects to be added in general addition are called the <b>terms</b>, the <b>addends</b>, or the <b>summands</b>; this terminology carries over to the summation of multiple terms. This is to be distinguished from <i>factors</i>, which are <a href="../../wp/m/Multiplication.htm" title="Multiplication">multiplied</a>. Some authors call the first addend the <i>augend</i>. In fact, during the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, many authors did not consider the first addend an "addend" at all. Today, due to the <a href="../../wp/c/Commutative_property.htm" title="Commutative property">commutative property</a> of addition, "augend" is rarely used, and both terms are generally called addends.</p>
       <p>All of this terminology derives from <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>. "<!--del_lnk--> Addition" and "<!--del_lnk--> add" are <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> words derived from the Latin <!--del_lnk--> verb <i>addere</i>, which is in turn a <!--del_lnk--> compound of <i>ad</i> "to" and <i>dare</i> "to give", from the <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Indo-European root <span class="Unicode" lang="ine" style="white-space: nowrap" title="Proto-Indo-European language" xml:lang="ine"><i>*deh&#x2083;-</i></span> "to give"; thus to <i>add</i> is to <i>give to</i>. Using the <!--del_lnk--> gerundive <!--del_lnk--> suffix <i>-nd</i> results in "addend", "thing to be added". Likewise from <i>augere</i> "to increase", one gets "augend", "thing to be increased".</p>

       <p>"Sum" and "summand" derive from the Latin <!--del_lnk--> noun <i>summa</i> "the highest, the top" and associated verb <i>summare</i>. This is appropriate not only because the sum of two positive numbers is greater than either, but because it was once common to add upward, contrary to the modern practice of adding downward, so that a sum was literally higher than the addends. <i>Addere</i> and <i>summare</i> date back at least to <!--del_lnk--> Boethius, if not to earlier Roman writers such as <!--del_lnk--> Vitruvius and <!--del_lnk--> Frontinus; Boethius also used several other terms for the addition operation. The later <!--del_lnk--> Middle English terms "adden" and "adding" were popularized by <a href="../../wp/g/Geoffrey_Chaucer.htm" title="Geoffrey Chaucer">Chaucer</a>.<br style="clear:both;" />
       </p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Interpretations">Interpretations</span></h2>
       <p>Addition is used to model countless physical processes. Even for the simple case of adding <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_number.htm" title="Natural number">natural numbers</a>, there are many possible interpretations and even more visual representations.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Combining_sets">Combining sets</span></h3>
       <div class="floatright"><a class="image" href="../../images/1512/151229.png.htm"><img alt="AdditionShapes.svg" height="190" src="../../images/1512/151229.png"  width="200" /></a></div>
       <p>Possibly the most fundamental interpretation of addition lies in combining sets:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>When two or more disjoint collections are combined into a single collection, the number of objects in the single collection is the sum of the number of objects in the original collections.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>This interpretation is easy to visualize, with little danger of ambiguity. It is also useful in higher mathematics; for the <!--del_lnk--> rigorous definition it inspires, see <i><a href="#Natural_numbers">Natural numbers</a></i> below. However, it is not obvious how one should extend this version of addition to include fractional numbers or negative numbers.</p>
       <p>One possible fix is to consider collections of objects that can be easily divided, such as <!--del_lnk--> pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather than just combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Extending_a_length">Extending a length</span></h3>
       <p>A second interpretation of addition comes from extending an initial length by a given length:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>When an original length is extended by a given amount, the final length is the sum of the original length and the length of the extension.</li>
       </ul>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The sum <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> can be interpreted as a <!--del_lnk--> binary operation that combines <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, in an algebraic sense, or it can be interpreted as the addition of <i>b</i> more units to <i>a</i>. Under the latter interpretation, the parts of a sum <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> play asymmetric roles, and the operation <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> is viewed as applying the <!--del_lnk--> unary operation +<i>b</i> to <i>a</i>. Instead of calling both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> addends, it is more appropriate to call <i>a</i> the <b>augend</b> in this case, since <i>a</i> plays a passive role. The unary view is also useful when discussing <a href="../../wp/s/Subtraction.htm" title="Subtraction">subtraction</a>, because each unary addition operation has an inverse unary subtraction operation, and <i>vice versa.</i></p>

       </div>
       <p>Addition is <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Commutative_property.htm" title="Commutative">commutative</a>, meaning that one can reverse the terms in a sum left-to-right, and the result is the same as the last one.

       <dl>
        <dd><i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = <i>b</i> + <i>a</i>.</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>The fact that addition is commutative is known as the "commutative law of addition". This phrase suggests that there are other commutative laws: for example, there is a commutative law of multiplication. However, many <!--del_lnk--> binary operations are not commutative, such as subtraction and division, so it is misleading to speak of an unqualified "commutative law".</p>

       <div class="thumb tleft">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:102px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/1512/151244.png.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="105" src="../../images/1512/151244.png"  width="100" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>A somewhat subtler property of addition is <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Associative_property.htm" title="Associativity">associativity</a>, which comes up when one tries to define repeated addition. Should the expression</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>"<i>a</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>c</i>"</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>be defined to mean (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) + <i>c</i> or <i>a</i> + (<i>b</i> + <i>c</i>)? That addition is associative tells us that the choice of definition is irrelevant. For any three numbers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, it is true that</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>(<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) + <i>c</i> = <i>a</i> + (<i>b</i> + <i>c</i>).</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>For example, (1 + 2) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 = 1 + 5 = 1 + (2 + 3). Not all operations are associative, so in expressions with other operations like subtraction, it is important to specify the <!--del_lnk--> order of operations.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Identity_element">Identity element</span></h3>

       <p>When adding <a href="../../wp/0/0_%2528number%2529.htm" title="0 (number)">zero</a> to any number, the quantity does not change; zero is the <!--del_lnk--> identity element for addition, also known as the <!--del_lnk--> additive identity. In symbols, for any <i>a</i>,</p>
       <dl>
        <dd><i>a</i> + 0 = 0 + <i>a</i> = <i>a</i>.</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>This law was first identified in <!--del_lnk--> Brahmagupta's <i><!--del_lnk--> Brahmasphutasiddhanta</i> in 628 AD, although he wrote it as three separate laws, depending on whether <i>a</i> is negative, positive, or zero itself, and he used words rather than algebraic symbols. Later <!--del_lnk--> Indian mathematicians refined the concept; around the year 830, <!--del_lnk--> Mahavira wrote, "zero becomes the same as what is added to it", corresponding to the unary statement 0 + <i>a</i> = <i>a</i>. In the 12th century, <!--del_lnk--> Bhaskara wrote, "In the addition of cipher, or subtraction of it, the quantity, positive or negative, remains the same", corresponding to the unary statement <i>a</i> + 0 = <i>a</i>.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Successor">Successor</span></h3>
       <p>In the context of integers, addition of <a href="../../wp/1/1_%2528number%2529.htm" title="1 (number)">one</a> also plays a special role: for any integer <i>a</i>, the integer (<i>a</i> + 1) is the least integer greater than <i>a</i>, also known as the successor of <i>a</i>. Because of this succession, the value of some <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> can also be seen as the <img alt="b^{th}" class="tex" src="../../images/1512/151252.png" /> successor of <i>a</i>, making addition iterated succession.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Units">Units</span></h3>
       <p>To numerically add physical quantities with <!--del_lnk--> units, they must first be expressed with common units. For example, if a measure of 5&nbsp;feet is extended by 2&nbsp;inches, the sum is 62&nbsp;inches, since 60&nbsp;inches is synonymous with 5&nbsp;feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3 meters and 4 square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort of consideration is fundamental in <!--del_lnk--> dimensional analysis.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Performing_addition">Performing addition</span></h2>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Innate_ability">Innate ability</span></h3>
       <p>Studies on mathematical development starting around the 1980s have exploited the phenomenon of <!--del_lnk--> habituation: <!--del_lnk--> infants look longer at situations that are unexpected. A seminal experiment by <!--del_lnk--> Karen Wynn in 1992 involving <a href="../../wp/m/Mickey_Mouse.htm" title="Mickey Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> dolls manipulated behind a screen demonstrated that five-month-old infants <i>expect</i> 1 + 1 to be 2, and they are comparatively surprised when a physical situation seems to imply that 1 + 1 is either 1 or 3. This finding has since been affirmed by a variety of laboratories using different methodologies. Another 1992 experiment with older <!--del_lnk--> toddlers, between 18 to 35 months, exploited their development of motor control by allowing them to retrieve <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Table_tennis.htm" title="Ping-pong">ping-pong</a> balls from a box; the youngest responded well for small numbers, while older subjects were able to compute sums up to 5.</p>
       <p>Even some nonhuman animals show a limited ability to add, particularly <!--del_lnk--> primates. In a 1995 experiment imitating Wynn's 1992 result (but using <!--del_lnk--> eggplants instead of dolls), <!--del_lnk--> rhesus macaques and <!--del_lnk--> cottontop tamarins performed similarly to human infants. More dramatically, after being taught the meanings of the <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_numerals.htm" title="Arabic numerals">Arabic numerals</a> 0 through 4, one <!--del_lnk--> chimpanzee was able to compute the sum of two numerals without further training.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Discovering_addition_as_children">Discovering addition as children</span></h3>
       <p>Typically, children first master <!--del_lnk--> counting. When given a problem that requires that two items and three items be combined, young children model the situation with physical objects, often fingers or a drawing, and then count the total. As they gain experience, they learn or discover the strategy of "counting-on": asked to find two plus three, children count three past two, saying "three, four, <i>five</i>" (usually ticking off fingers), and arriving at five. This strategy seems almost universal; children can easily pick it up from peers or teachers. Most discover it independently. With additional experience, children learn to add more quickly by exploiting the commutativity of addition by counting up from the larger number, in this case starting with three and counting "four, <i>five</i>." Eventually children begin to recall certain addition facts ("<!--del_lnk--> number bonds"), either through experience or rote memorization. Once some facts are committed to memory, children begin to derive unknown facts from known ones. For example, a child asked to add six and seven may know that 6+6=12 and then reason that 6+7 is one more, or 13. Such derived facts can be found very quickly and most elementary school student eventually rely on a mixture of memorized and derived facts to add fluently.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Decimal_system">Decimal system</span></h3>
       <p>The prerequisite to addition in the <a href="../../wp/d/Decimal.htm" title="Decimal">decimal</a> system is the fluent recall or derivation of the 100 single-digit "addition facts". One could <!--del_lnk--> memorize all the facts by <!--del_lnk--> rote, but pattern-based strategies are more enlightening and, for most people, more efficient:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><i>Commutative property</i>: Mentioned above, using the pattern <i>a + b = b + a</i> reduces the number of "addition facts" from 100 to 55.</li>
        <li><i>One or two more</i>: Adding 1 or 2 is a basic task, and it can be accomplished through counting on or, ultimately, <!--del_lnk--> intuition.</li>
        <li><i>Zero</i>: Since zero is the additive identity, adding zero is trivial. Nonetheless, in the teaching of arithmetic, some students are introduced to addition as a process that always increases the addends; <!--del_lnk--> word problems may help rationalize the "exception" of zero.</li>
        <li><i>Doubles</i>: Adding a number to itself is related to counting by two and to <a href="../../wp/m/Multiplication.htm" title="Multiplication">multiplication</a>. Doubles facts form a backbone for many related facts, and students find them relatively easy to grasp.</li>
        <li><i>Near-doubles</i>: Sums such as 6+7=13 can be quickly derived from the doubles fact 6+6=12 by adding one more, or from 7+7=14 but subtracting one.</li>
        <li><i>Five and ten</i>: Sums of the form 5+x and 10+x are usually memorized early and can be used for deriving other facts. For example, 6+7=13 can be derived from 5+7=12 by adding one more.</li>
        <li><i>Making ten</i>: An advanced strategy uses 10 as an intermediate for sums involving 8 or 9; for example, 8&nbsp;+&nbsp;6 = 8&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;4 = 10&nbsp;+&nbsp;4 = 14.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>As students grow older, they commit more facts to memory, and learn to derive other facts rapidly and fluently. Many students never commit all the facts to memory, but can still find any basic fact quickly.</p>
       <p>The standard algorithm for adding multidigit numbers is to align the addends vertically and add the columns, starting from the ones column on the right. If a column exceeds ten, the extra digit is "<!--del_lnk--> carried" into the next column. An alternate strategy starts adding from the most significant digit on the left; this route makes carrying a little clumsier, but it is faster at getting a rough estimate of the sum. There are many other <!--del_lnk--> alternative methods.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Analog computers work directly with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms depend on the form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic_mean.htm" title="Arithmetic mean">averaging</a> <!--del_lnk--> lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two <!--del_lnk--> shafts, they can be added with a <!--del_lnk--> differential. A hydraulic adder can add the <!--del_lnk--> pressures in two chambers by exploiting <a href="../../wp/n/Newton%2527s_laws_of_motion.htm" title="Newton's laws of motion">Newton's second law</a> to balance forces on an assembly of <!--del_lnk--> pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two <!--del_lnk--> voltages (referenced to <!--del_lnk--> ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a <!--del_lnk--> resistor <!--del_lnk--> network, but a better design exploits an <!--del_lnk--> operational amplifier.</p>
       <p>Addition is also fundamental to the operation of <a href="../../wp/c/Computer.htm" title="Computer">digital computers</a>, where the efficiency of addition, in particular the <!--del_lnk--> carry mechanism, is an important limitation to overall performance.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Adding machines, mechanical calculators whose primary function was addition, were the earliest automatic, digital computers. <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Schickard's 1623 Calculating Clock could add and subtract, but it was severely limited by an awkward carry mechanism. Burnt during its construction in 1624 and unknown to the world for more than three centuries, it was rediscovered in 1957 and therefore had no impact on the development of mechanical calculators. <a href="../../wp/b/Blaise_Pascal.htm" title="Blaise Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> invented the mechanical calculator in 1642 with an ingenious gravity-assisted carry mechanism. <!--del_lnk--> Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism in a different sense: its wheels turned only one way, so it could add but not subtract, except by the <!--del_lnk--> method of complements. By 1674 <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> made the first mechanical multiplier; it was still powered, if not motivated, by addition.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Adders execute integer addition in electronic digital computers, usually using <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Binary_number.htm" title="Binary arithmetic">binary arithmetic</a>. The simplest architecture is the ripple carry adder, which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm. One slight improvement is the <!--del_lnk--> carry skip design, again following human intuition; one does not perform all the carries in computing 999 + 1, but one bypasses the group of 9s and skips to the answer.</p>
       <p>Since they compute digits one at a time, the above methods are too slow for most modern purposes. In modern digital computers, integer addition is typically the fastest arithmetic instruction, yet it has the largest impact on performance, since it underlies all the <!--del_lnk--> floating-point operations as well as such basic tasks as <!--del_lnk--> address generation during <!--del_lnk--> memory access and fetching <!--del_lnk--> instructions during <!--del_lnk--> branching. To increase speed, modern designs calculate digits in <!--del_lnk--> parallel; these schemes go by such names as carry select, <!--del_lnk--> carry lookahead, and the <!--del_lnk--> Ling pseudocarry. Almost all modern implementations are, in fact, hybrids of these last three designs.</p>
       <p>Unlike addition on <!--del_lnk--> paper, addition on a computer often changes the addends. On the ancient <a href="../../wp/a/Abacus.htm" title="Abacus">abacus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> adding board, both addends are destroyed, leaving only the sum. The influence of the abacus on mathematical thinking was strong enough that early <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> texts often claimed that in the process of adding "a number to a number", both numbers vanish. In modern times, the ADD instruction of a <!--del_lnk--> microprocessor replaces the augend with the sum but preserves the addend. In a <!--del_lnk--> high-level programming language, evaluating <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> does not change either <i>a</i> or <i>b</i>; if the goal is to replace <i>a</i> with the sum this must be explicitly requested, typically with the statement <i>a</i> = <i>a</i> + <i>b</i>. Some languages such as <a href="../../wp/c/C_%2528programming_language%2529.htm" title="C (programming language)">C</a> or <a href="../../wp/c/C%252B%252B.htm" title="C++">C++</a> allow this to be abbreviated as <i>a</i> += <i>b</i>.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Addition_of_natural_and_real_numbers">Addition of natural and real numbers</span></h2>
       <p>To prove the usual properties of addition, one must first <i>define</i> addition for the context in question. Addition is first defined on the <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_number.htm" title="Natural number">natural numbers</a>. In <a href="../../wp/s/Set_theory.htm" title="Set theory">set theory</a>, addition is then extended to progressively larger sets that include the natural numbers: the <a href="../../wp/i/Integer.htm" title="Integer">integers</a>, the <a href="../../wp/r/Rational_number.htm" title="Rational number">rational numbers</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/r/Real_number.htm" title="Real number">real numbers</a>. (In <!--del_lnk--> mathematics education, positive fractions are added before negative numbers are even considered; this is also the historical route)</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_numbers">Natural numbers</span></h3>
       <p>There are two popular ways to define the sum of two natural numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. If one defines natural numbers to be the <a href="../../wp/c/Cardinal_number.htm" title="Cardinal number">cardinalities</a> of finite sets, (the cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set), then it is appropriate to define their sum as follows:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Let N(<i>S</i>) be the cardinality of a set <i>S</i>. Take two disjoint sets <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, with N(<i>A</i>) = <i>a</i> and N(<i>B</i>) = <i>b</i>. Then <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> is defined as <img alt=" N(A \cup B)" class="tex" src="../../images/1512/151262.png" />.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Here, <i>A</i>&nbsp;U&nbsp;<i>B</i> is the <!--del_lnk--> union of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. An alternate version of this definition allows <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> to possibly overlap and then takes their <!--del_lnk--> disjoint union, a mechanism that allows common elements to be separated out and therefore counted twice.</p>
       <p>The other popular definition is recursive:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Let <i>n</i><sup>+</sup> be the <!--del_lnk--> successor of <i>n</i>, that is the number following <i>n</i> in the natural numbers, so 0<sup>+</sup>=1, 1<sup>+</sup>=2. Define <i>a</i> + 0 = <i>a</i>. Define the general sum recursively by <i>a</i> + (<i>b</i><sup>+</sup>) = (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>)<sup>+</sup>. Hence 1+1=1+0<sup>+</sup>=(1+0)<sup>+</sup>=1<sup>+</sup>=2.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Again, there are minor variations upon this definition in the literature. Taken literally, the above definition is an application of the <!--del_lnk--> Recursion Theorem on the <!--del_lnk--> poset <b>N</b><sup>2</sup>. On the other hand, some sources prefer to use a restricted Recursion Theorem that applies only to the set of natural numbers. One then considers <i>a</i> to be temporarily "fixed", applies recursion on <i>b</i> to define a function "<i>a</i> + ", and pastes these unary operations for all <i>a</i> together to form the full binary operation.</p>
       <p>This recursive formulation of addition was developed by Dedekind as early as 1854, and he would expand upon it in the following decades. He proved the associative and commutative properties, among others, through <!--del_lnk--> mathematical induction; for examples of such inductive proofs, see <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Addition.htm" title="Addition of natural numbers">Addition of natural numbers</a></i>.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The simplest conception of an integer is that it consists of an <a href="../../wp/a/Absolute_value.htm" title="Absolute value">absolute value</a> (which is a natural number) and a <!--del_lnk--> sign (generally either <!--del_lnk--> positive or <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Negative_number.htm" title="Negative numbers">negative</a>). The integer zero is a special third case, being neither positive nor negative. The corresponding definition of addition must proceed by cases:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>For an integer <i>n</i>, let |<i>n</i>| be its absolute value. Let <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> be integers. If either <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> is zero, treat it as an identity. If <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are both positive, define <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = |<i>a</i>| + |<i>b</i>|. If <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are both negative, define <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = &minus;(|<i>a</i>|+|<i>b</i>|). If <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> have different signs, define <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> to be the difference between |<i>a</i>| and |<i>b</i>|, with the sign of the term whose absolute value is larger.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Although this definition can be useful for concrete problems, it is far too complicated to produce elegant general proofs; there are too many cases to consider.</p>
       <p>A much more convenient conception of the integers is the <!--del_lnk--> Grothendieck group construction. The essential observation is that every integer can be expressed (not uniquely) as the difference of two natural numbers, so we may as well <i>define</i> an integer as the difference of two natural numbers. Addition is then defined to be compatible with subtraction:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Given two integers <i>a</i> &minus; <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> &minus; <i>d</i>, where <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> are natural numbers, define (<i>a</i> &minus; <i>b</i>) + (<i>c</i> &minus; <i>d</i>) = (<i>a</i> + <i>c</i>) &minus; (<i>b</i> + <i>d</i>).</li>
       </ul>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Rational_numbers_.28fractions.29">Rational numbers (fractions)</span></h3>
       <p>Addition of <a href="../../wp/r/Rational_number.htm" title="Rational number">rational numbers</a> can be computed using the <!--del_lnk--> least common denominator, but a conceptually simpler definition involves only integer addition and multiplication:</p>

       <p>A common construction of the set of real numbers is the Dedekind completion of the set of rational numbers. A real number is defined to be a <!--del_lnk--> Dedekind cut of rationals: a <!--del_lnk--> non-empty set of rationals that is closed downward and has no <!--del_lnk--> greatest element. The sum of real numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is defined element by element:</p>

       </ul>
       <p>This definition was first published, in a slightly modified form, by <!--del_lnk--> Richard Dedekind in 1872. The commutativity and associativity of real addition are immediate; defining the real number 0 to be the set of negative rationals, it is easily seen to be the additive identity. Probably the trickiest part of this construction pertaining to addition is the definition of additive inverses.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Unfortunately, dealing with multiplication of Dedekind cuts is a case-by-case nightmare similar to the addition of signed integers. Another approach is the metric completion of the rational numbers. A real number is essentially defined to be the a limit of a <!--del_lnk--> Cauchy sequence of rationals, lim <i>a</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>. Addition is defined term by term:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Define <img alt="\lim_na_n+\lim_nb_n = \lim_n(a_n+b_n)." class="tex" src="../../images/1512/151277.png" /></li>
       </ul>
       <p>This definition was first published by <a href="../../wp/g/Georg_Cantor.htm" title="Georg Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>, also in 1872, although his formalism was slightly different. One must prove that this operation is well-defined, dealing with co-Cauchy sequences. Once that task is done, all the properties of real addition follow immediately from the properties of rational numbers. Furthermore, the other arithmetic operations, including multiplication, have straightforward, analogous definitions.</p>

        <dd><i>e</i><sup><i>a</i> + <i>b</i></sup> = <i>e</i><sup><i>a</i></sup> <i>e</i><sup><i>b</i></sup>.</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>This identity allows multiplication to be carried out by consulting a <!--del_lnk--> table of <a href="../../wp/l/Logarithm.htm" title="Logarithm">logarithms</a> and computing addition by hand; it also enables multiplication on a <!--del_lnk--> slide rule. The formula is still a good first-order approximation in the broad context of <!--del_lnk--> Lie groups, where it relates multiplication of infinitesimal group elements with addition of vectors in the associated <!--del_lnk--> Lie algebra.</p>
       <p>There are even more generalizations of multiplication than addition. In general, multiplication operations always <!--del_lnk--> distribute over addition; this requirement is formalized in the definition of a <!--del_lnk--> ring. In some contexts, such as the integers, distributivity over addition and the existence of a multiplicative identity is enough to uniquely determine the multiplication operation. The distributive property also provides information about addition; by expanding the product (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)(<i>a</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>b</i>) in both ways, one concludes that addition is forced to be commutative. For this reason, ring addition is commutative in general.</p>
       <p><b><a href="../../wp/d/Division_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Division (mathematics)">Division</a></b> is an arithmetic operation remotely related to addition. Since <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> = <i>a</i>(<i>b</i><sup>&minus;1</sup>), division is right distributive over addition: (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) / <i>c</i> = <i>a</i> / <i>c</i> + <i>b</i> / <i>c</i>. However, division is not left distributive over addition; 1/ (2 + 2) is not the same as 1/2 + 1/2.</p>

       <p>The <b>maximum operation</b> "max (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>)" is a binary operation similar to addition. In fact, if two nonnegative numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are of different <!--del_lnk--> orders of magnitude, then their sum is approximately equal to their maximum. This approximation is extremely useful in the applications of mathematics, for example in truncating <a href="../../wp/t/Taylor_series.htm" title="Taylor series">Taylor series</a>. However, it presents a perpetual difficulty in <!--del_lnk--> numerical analysis, essentially since "max" is not invertible. If <i>b</i> is much greater than <i>a</i>, then a straightforward calculation of (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) &minus; <i>b</i> can accumulate an unacceptable <!--del_lnk--> round-off error, perhaps even returning zero. See also <i><!--del_lnk--> Loss of significance</i>.</p>
       <p>The approximation becomes exact in a kind of infinite limit; if either <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> is an infinite <a href="../../wp/c/Cardinal_number.htm" title="Cardinal number">cardinal number</a>, their cardinal sum is exactly equal to the greater of the two. Accordingly, there is no subtraction operation for infinite cardinals.</p>
       <p>Maximization is commutative and associative, like addition. Furthermore, since addition preserves the ordering of real numbers, addition distributes over "max" in the same way that multiplication distributes over addition:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd><i>a</i> + max (<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) = max (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>, <i>a</i> + <i>c</i>).</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>For these reasons, in <!--del_lnk--> tropical geometry one replaces multiplication with addition and addition with maximization. In this context, addition is called "tropical multiplication", maximization is called "tropical addition", and the tropical "additive identity" is <!--del_lnk--> negative infinity. Some authors prefer to replace addition with minimization; then the additive identity is positive infinity.</p>
       <p>Tying these observations together, tropical addition is approximately related to regular addition through the <a href="../../wp/l/Logarithm.htm" title="Logarithm">logarithm</a>:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>log (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) &asymp; max (log <i>a</i>, log <i>b</i>),</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>which becomes more accurate as the base of the logarithm increases. The approximation can be made exact by extracting a constant <i>h</i>, named by analogy with <!--del_lnk--> Planck's constant from <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, and taking the "<!--del_lnk--> classical limit" as <i>h</i> tends to zero:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd><img alt="\max(a,b) = \lim_{h\to 0}h\log(e^{a/h}+e^{b/h})." class="tex" src="../../images/1512/151286.png" /></dd>
       </dl>
       <p>In this sense, the maximum operation is a <i>dequantized</i> version of addition.</p>

       <p><b>Incrementation</b>, also known as the <!--del_lnk--> successor operation, is the addition of <a href="../../wp/1/1_%2528number%2529.htm" title="1 (number)">1</a> to a number.</p>
       <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Summation</b> describes the addition of arbitrarily many numbers, usually more than just two. It includes the idea of the sum of a single number, which is itself, and the <!--del_lnk--> empty sum, which is <a href="../../wp/0/0_%2528number%2529.htm" title="0 (number)">zero</a>. An infinite summation is a delicate procedure known as a <!--del_lnk--> series.</p>
       <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Counting</b> a finite set is equivalent to summing 1 over the set.</p>
       <p><b><a href="../../wp/i/Integral.htm" title="Integral">Integration</a></b> is a kind of "summation" over a <!--del_lnk--> continuum, or more precisely and generally, over a <!--del_lnk--> differentiable <a href="../../wp/m/Manifold.htm" title="Manifold">manifold</a>. Integration over a zero-dimensional manifold reduces to summation.</p>
       <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Linear combinations</b> combine multiplication and summation; they are sums in which each term has a multiplier, usually a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Real_number.htm" title="Real numbers">real</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Complex_number.htm" title="Complex numbers">complex</a> number. Linear combinations are especially useful in contexts where straightforward addition would violate some normalization rule, such as <!--del_lnk--> mixing of <!--del_lnk--> strategies in <a href="../../wp/g/Game_theory.htm" title="Game theory">game theory</a> or <!--del_lnk--> superposition of <!--del_lnk--> states in <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.</p>
       <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Convolution</b> is used to add two independent <a href="../../wp/r/Random_variable.htm" title="Random variable">random variables</a> defined by <a href="../../wp/p/Probability_distribution.htm" title="Probability distribution">distribution functions</a>. Its usual definition combines integration, subtraction, and multiplication. In general, convolution is useful as a kind of domain-side addition; by contrast, vector addition is a kind of range-side addition.</p>
