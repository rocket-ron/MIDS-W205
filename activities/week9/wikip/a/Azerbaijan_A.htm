<h2><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_OSImage_preview" alt="Children learning to dance in SOS Social Centre FSP in Baku, Azerbaijan" />Ganja</h2>
<p><strong>Description of Social Centre/FSP: </strong></p>
<p>A Social Centre was constructed in Ganja in 2009. The family strengthening programme offers access to essential services for children&#x2019;s development (eg. educational, nutritional, health support, social skills) and supports families to protect and care for their children. The programme also aims at linking families with income generating activities and offers help to improve the parents&#x2019; parenting skills.</p>
<p><strong>Work and Achievements: </strong></p>
<p>In order to expand services and reach more beneficiaries the project focused its activities on building of social centre. As a centre, Ganja Family Strengthening Programme started its activity in early June. Once a week the team organizes Mothers&#x2019; Club along with tutoring and handicraft classes for children beneficiaries&#x2019; (age range 7 - 14). Tutoring and handicraft classes are coordinated and held by two project volunteers. While mothers participate in Mothers&#x2019; Club, their children are engaged in tutoring and handicraft classes. The major goal of these activities is to develop new skills and give mothers and their children a chance to spend their leisure time effectively by coming together, sharing new skills and experience.</p>
<p>Together with volunteers, FS team created a play room within the Centre. Also, the strategy of individual approach to each family was implemented. Therefore, on the basis of investigations made by social workers, families&#x2019; needs were discovered and met individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Caregivers who successfully accomplished vocational courses were provided with necessary equipment (sewing machines, cosmetology tools, etc.) for building their business. In addition, with the help of the programme, several of these families got social benefits from the government.</p>
<p>Families continue to benefit from free juridical consultancy and medicines. In addition, expensive surgery of one child was organized by the project in 2009.</p>
<p>21 children from elementary school were provided with uniforms and school kits. One child&#x2019;s education fee was paid by the project. Currently,this child is the best student in the class.</p>
<p>Living conditions of 21 families were improved. This included repair work in the houses, distribution of heaters, beds, etc. Of the families</p>
