       <p><b>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger</b> (<small>English pronunciation:</small> <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> /&#x2C8;&#x283;w&#x254;rts&#x259;n&#x25B;&#x261;&#x259;r/</span>, <small>German:</small> <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> [&#x2C8;a&#x250;n&#x254;lt &#x2C8;al&#x254;&#x28F;s &#x2C8;&#x283;va&#x250;ts&#x259;n&#x2CC;&#x294;&#x25B;&#x261;&#x250;]</span>; born July 30, 1947) is an <!--del_lnk--> Austrian-American <!--del_lnk--> bodybuilder, actor, model, businessman, and <!--del_lnk--> politician who served as the <!--del_lnk--> 38th Governor of California.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger began weight training at 15. He was awarded the title of <!--del_lnk--> Mr. Universe at age 20 and went on to win the <!--del_lnk--> Mr. Olympia contest a total of seven times. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent presence in the sport of bodybuilding and has written several books and numerous articles on the sport.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood action film icon, noted for his lead roles in such films as <i><!--del_lnk--> Conan the Barbarian</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Terminator</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Commando</i>. He was nicknamed the "Austrian Oak" and the "<!--del_lnk--> Styrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnie" during his acting career, and more recently the "Governator" (a <!--del_lnk--> portmanteau of "Governor" and "<!--del_lnk--> Terminator").</p>
       <p>As a <!--del_lnk--> Republican, he was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special <!--del_lnk--> recall election to replace then-Governor <!--del_lnk--> Gray Davis. Schwarzenegger was sworn in on November 17, 2003, to serve the remainder of Davis's term. Schwarzenegger was then re-elected on November 7, 2006, in <!--del_lnk--> California's 2006 gubernatorial election, to serve a full term as governor, defeating <!--del_lnk--> Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Phil Angelides, who was <!--del_lnk--> California State Treasurer at the time. Schwarzenegger was sworn in for his second term on January 5, 2007.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
       <p>Schwarzenegger was born in <!--del_lnk--> Thal, Austria, a small village bordering the <!--del_lnk--> Styrian capital <!--del_lnk--> Graz, and was <!--del_lnk--> christened Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger. His parents were the local <!--del_lnk--> police chief <!--del_lnk--> Gustav Schwarzenegger (1907&ndash;1972) and Aurelia Jadrny (1922&ndash;1998). His father served in World War II with the <!--del_lnk--> German Army as a <!--del_lnk--> Hauptfeldwebel of the <!--del_lnk--> Feldgendarmerie and was discharged in 1943 after contracting <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a>. They were married on October 20, 1945&nbsp;&ndash; Gustav was 38, and Aurelia was a 23-year-old widow with a son named Meinhard. According to Schwarzenegger, both of his parents were very strict: "Back then in Austria it was a very different world, if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared." He grew up in a Roman Catholic family who attended church service every Sunday.</p>
       <p>Gustav had a preference for Meinhard, the elder of the two sons. His favoritism was "strong and blatant," which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his child. Schwarzenegger has said his father had "no patience for listening or understanding your problems... there was a wall; a real wall." Schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death. In later life, Schwarzenegger commissioned the <!--del_lnk--> Simon Wiesenthal Centre to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of atrocities despite Gustav's membership in the <!--del_lnk--> Nazi Party and <!--del_lnk--> SA. At school, Schwarzenegger was apparently in the middle, but stood out for his "cheerful, good-humored and exuberant" character. Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.</p>
       <p>As a boy, Schwarzenegger played many sports, heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first <!--del_lnk--> barbell in 1960, when his <a href="../../wp/a/Association_football.htm" title="Association football">football</a> coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose <!--del_lnk--> bodybuilding over football (soccer) as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: "I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting." However, his official website biography claims: "At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career." During a speech in 2001, he said, <i>"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school."</i> Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as <!--del_lnk--> Reg Park, <!--del_lnk--> Steve Reeves and <!--del_lnk--> Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. <i>"I was inspired by individuals like Reg Park and Steve Reeves."</i> When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: <i>"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams ... Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve."</i> In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. <i>"It would make me sick to miss a workout ... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it."</i> When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied, <i>"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a <!--del_lnk--> John Wayne movie."</i></p>
       <p>In 1971, his brother Meinhard died in a car accident. Meinhard had been drinking and was killed instantly, and Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was due to marry Erika Knapp, and the couple had a three-year-old son, Patrick. Schwarzenegger would pay for Patrick's education and help him to immigrate to the United States. Gustav died the following year from a stroke. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Pumping Iron</i>, Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport, and to make Schwarzenegger's image more cold and machine-like in order to fan controversy for the film. Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, has said he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother. Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.</p>
       <p>In an interview with <i><!--del_lnk--> Fortune</i> magazine in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what "would now be called child abuse" from his father:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'you can't do this,' I said, 'this is not going to be for much longer, because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'</div>
       </blockquote>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_adulthood">Early adulthood</span></h3>
       <p>Schwarzenegger served in the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males. He won the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965. Schwarzenegger went <!--del_lnk--> AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and spent a week in an army jail: "Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences." He won another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirer Hof Hotel (where he had placed second). He was voted best built man of Europe, which made him famous.</p>
       <p>"The <!--del_lnk--> Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America&nbsp;&ndash; the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich." Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the <!--del_lnk--> NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London. He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner <!--del_lnk--> Chester Yorton.</p>
       <p>Charles "Wag" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in <!--del_lnk--> Forest Gate, London, England. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the <!--del_lnk--> East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Also in 1966, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol <!--del_lnk--> Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20. He would go on to win the title a further three times. Schwarzenegger then flew back to <a href="../../wp/m/Munich.htm" title="Munich">Munich</a>, training for four to six hours daily, attending business school and working in a health club (Rolf Putzinger's gym where he worked and trained from 1966&ndash;1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title. He frequently told <!--del_lnk--> Roger C. Field, a friend in Munich at that time, "I'm going to become the greatest actor!"</p>

       <p>Schwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the U.S. since the age of 10, and saw bodybuilding as the avenue through which to do so, realized his dream by moving to the United States in September 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little English. "Naturally, when I came to this country, my accent was very bad, and my accent was also very strong, which was an obstacle as I began to pursue acting." There he trained at <!--del_lnk--> Gold's Gym in <!--del_lnk--> Santa Monica, California, under <!--del_lnk--> Joe Weider. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was <!--del_lnk--> Ric Drasin, a <!--del_lnk--> professional wrestler who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973. Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler <!--del_lnk--> "Superstar" Billy Graham. In 1970, at age 23, he captured his first <!--del_lnk--> Mr. Olympia title in New York, and would go on to win the title a total of seven times.</p>
       <p>Immigration law firm Siskind &amp; Susser have stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an <!--del_lnk--> illegal immigrant at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his <!--del_lnk--> visa. <i><!--del_lnk--> LA Weekly</i> would later say in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous <!--del_lnk--> immigrant in America, who "overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s".</p>
       <p>In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland Baker, an English teacher he lived with until 1974. Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his <!--del_lnk--> memoir in 1977: "Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life." Baker has described Schwarzenegger as "[a] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic" but claims towards the end of the relationship he became "insufferable&nbsp;&ndash; classically conceited&nbsp;&ndash; the world revolved around him". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled <i>Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak</i>. Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S.&nbsp;&ndash; their first date was watching the <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo_11.htm" title="Apollo 11">first Apollo Moon landing</a> on television. They shared an <!--del_lnk--> apartment in <!--del_lnk--> Santa Monica for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had "little understanding of polite society" and she found him a turn-off, she says, "He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be&nbsp;&ndash;he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me."</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger met his next love, Sue Moray, a <!--del_lnk--> Beverly Hills hairdresser's assistant, on <!--del_lnk--> Venice Beach in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: "We were faithful when we were both in LA ... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted." Schwarzenegger met <!--del_lnk--> Maria Shriver at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977, and went on to have a relationship with both women until August 1978, when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.</p>
       <p>In 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography/weight-training guide <i>Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder</i> was published and became a huge success. After taking English classes at <!--del_lnk--> Santa Monica College in California, he earned a B.A. by correspondence from the <!--del_lnk--> University of Wisconsin&ndash;Superior, where he graduated Business and International Economics, in 1979.</p>

       <p>Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the <!--del_lnk--> Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent face in the bodybuilding sport long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.</p>
       <p>For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines <i><!--del_lnk--> Muscle &amp; Fitness</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Flex</i>. Shortly after being elected Governor, he was appointed <!--del_lnk--> executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. The magazine <i>MuscleMag International</i> has a monthly two-page article on him, and refers to him as "The King".</p>
       <p>One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965. He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19. He would go on to compete in and win many bodybuilding contests, as well as some <!--del_lnk--> weightlifting contests, including five Mr. Universe (4&nbsp;&ndash; <!--del_lnk--> NABBA [England], 1&nbsp;&ndash; <!--del_lnk--> IFBB [USA]) wins, and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until <!--del_lnk--> Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.</p>

       <p>In 1967, Schwarzenegger competed in and won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254&nbsp;kg/560&nbsp;lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mr._Olympia">Mr. Olympia</span></h3>
       <p>Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming <!--del_lnk--> Mr. Olympia. His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion <!--del_lnk--> Sergio Oliva. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he holds to this day.</p>
       <p>He continued his winning streak in the 1971&ndash;1974 competitions. In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time, beating <!--del_lnk--> Franco Columbu. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.</p>
       <p>Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called <i><!--del_lnk--> Pumping Iron.</i> Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Stay Hungry</i> with <!--del_lnk--> Jeff Bridges. <!--del_lnk--> Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia. Schwarzenegger was training for his role in <i><!--del_lnk--> Conan</i>, and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret, in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide <!--del_lnk--> colour commentary for network television, when he announced at the eleventh hour that while he was there: "Why not compete?" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger officially retired from competition.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Steroid_use">Steroid use</span></h3>
       <p>Schwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing <!--del_lnk--> anabolic steroids while they were legal, writing in 1977 that "steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when <!--del_lnk--> cutting up." He has called the drugs for "tissue building."</p>
       <p>In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Dr. Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and his later heart problems. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court. In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with <i><!--del_lnk--> The Globe</i>, a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.</p>

       <p>Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1970's <i><!--del_lnk--> Hercules in New York</i>. Credited under the name "Arnold Strong," his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were <!--del_lnk--> dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf mute hit-man for the mob in director <!--del_lnk--> Robert Altman's <i><!--del_lnk--> The Long Goodbye</i> (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Stay Hungry</i> (1976), for which he was awarded a <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career. "It was very difficult for me in the beginning&nbsp;&ndash; I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance."</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the <!--del_lnk--> bodybuilding film <i><!--del_lnk--> Pumping Iron</i> (1977), elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, Schwarzenegger purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography. Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Incredible Hulk</i>, but did not win the role because of his height. Later, <!--del_lnk--> Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with <!--del_lnk--> Kirk Douglas and <!--del_lnk--> Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> The Villain</i>. In 1980 he starred in a <!--del_lnk--> biopic of the 1950s actress <!--del_lnk--> Jayne Mansfield as Mansfield's husband, <!--del_lnk--> Mickey Hargitay.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the <!--del_lnk--> sword-and-sorcery epic <i><!--del_lnk--> Conan the Barbarian</i> in 1982, which was a box-office hit. This was followed by a sequel, <i><!--del_lnk--> Conan the Destroyer</i> in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor. In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video "<!--del_lnk--> Carnival in Rio".</p>
       <p>In 1984, he made the first of three appearances as the titular character and what some would say was the signature role in his acting career in director <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cameron.htm" title="James Cameron">James Cameron</a>'s science fiction <!--del_lnk--> thriller film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Terminator</i>. Following <i>The Terminator</i>, Schwarzenegger made <i><!--del_lnk--> Red Sonja</i> in 1985, which "sank without a trace."</p>
       <p>During the 1980s, audiences had a large appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and <!--del_lnk--> Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars. Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his droll, often self-deprecating sense of humor (including sometimes famously bad puns), separating his roles from more serious action hero fare. His alternative-universe comedy/thriller <i><!--del_lnk--> Last Action Hero</i> featured a poster of the movie <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i> which, in the fictional alternate universe, had <!--del_lnk--> Sylvester Stallone as its star.</p>
       <p>Following his arrival as a Hollywood superstar, he made a number of successful films: <i><!--del_lnk--> Commando</i> (1985), <i><!--del_lnk--> Raw Deal</i> (1986), <i><!--del_lnk--> The Running Man</i> (1987), and <i><!--del_lnk--> Red Heat</i> (1988). In <i><!--del_lnk--> Predator</i> (1987), another successful film, Schwarzenegger led a cast which included future <a href="../../wp/m/Minnesota.htm" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> <!--del_lnk--> Governor <!--del_lnk--> Jesse Ventura (Ventura also appeared in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Running Man</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Batman &amp; Robin</i> with Schwarzenegger) and future candidate for <!--del_lnk--> governor of Kentucky <!--del_lnk--> Sonny Landham.</p>

       </div>
       <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Twins</i> (1988), a comedy with <!--del_lnk--> Danny DeVito, was a change of pace, and also proved successful. <i><!--del_lnk--> Total Recall</i> (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10&nbsp;million and 15% of the gross, and was a widely praised, science fiction script directed by Paul Verhoeven, based on the <!--del_lnk--> Philip K. Dick short story, "<!--del_lnk--> We Can Remember It for You Wholesale". <i><!--del_lnk--> Kindergarten Cop</i> (1990) reunited him with director <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Reitman, who directed him in <i>Twins</i>. The movie also featured actress <!--del_lnk--> Pamela Reed.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into <!--del_lnk--> directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series <i><!--del_lnk--> Tales from the Crypt</i>, entitled "<!--del_lnk--> The Switch", and then with the 1992 <!--del_lnk--> telemovie <i><!--del_lnk--> Christmas in Connecticut</i>. He has not directed since.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger's commercial high-water mark was his return as the title character in 1991's <i><!--del_lnk--> Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i>, which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the <!--del_lnk--> National Association of Theatre Owners named him the "International Star of the Decade." His next film project, the 1993 self-aware <!--del_lnk--> action comedy <!--del_lnk--> spoof <i><!--del_lnk--> Last Action Hero</i> was released opposite <i><!--del_lnk--> Jurassic Park</i>, with the box office suffering accordingly. His next film, the comedy drama <i><!--del_lnk--> True Lies</i> (1994) was a highly popular spy film, and saw Schwarzenegger, reunited with James Cameron, appearing opposite <!--del_lnk--> Jamie Lee Curtis.</p>

       <p>Shortly thereafter came the comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> Junior</i> (1994), the last of his three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring <!--del_lnk--> Danny DeVito and also for the second time featuring <!--del_lnk--> Pamela Reed. This film brought Schwarzenegger his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for <!--del_lnk--> Best Actor&nbsp;&ndash; Musical or Comedy. It was followed by the action thriller <i><!--del_lnk--> Eraser</i> (1996) and the <!--del_lnk--> comic book-based <i><!--del_lnk--> Batman &amp; Robin</i> (1997), where he played the villain <!--del_lnk--> Mr. Freeze. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i>, Schwarzenegger's film career and box office prominence went into decline.</p>
       <p>Several film projects were announced with Schwarzenegger attached to star, including the remake of <i><!--del_lnk--> Planet of the Apes</i>, a new film version of <i><!--del_lnk--> I Am Legend</i>, and a World War II film scripted by <!--del_lnk--> Quentin Tarantino that would have seen Schwarzenegger play an Austrian for the fourth time (after <i>Stay Hungry</i>, <i>Junior</i> and <i>Kindergarten Cop</i>).</p>
       <p>Instead, he returned after a hiatus with the supernatural thriller <i><!--del_lnk--> <i>End of Days</i></i> (1999), later followed by the action films <i><!--del_lnk--> The 6th Day</i> (2000) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Collateral Damage</i> (2002) all of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in <i><!--del_lnk--> Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</i>, which went on to earn over $150&nbsp;million domestically.</p>
       <p>In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter (82&nbsp;ft) tall <i>Terminator</i> statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the <!--del_lnk--> Special Olympics.</p>
       <p>His film appearances after becoming Governor of California include a 3-second cameo appearance in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Rundown</i> (a.k.a., <i>Welcome to the Jungle</i>) with <!--del_lnk--> The Rock, and the 2004 remake of <i><!--del_lnk--> Around the World in 80 Days</i>, where he appeared onscreen with action star <!--del_lnk--> Jackie Chan for the first time. In 2005 he appeared as himself in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Kid &amp; I</i>. Schwarzenegger voiced <!--del_lnk--> Baron von Steuben in Episode 24 ("<!--del_lnk--> Valley Forge") of <i><!--del_lnk--> Liberty's Kids</i>.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger had been rumored to be appearing in <i><!--del_lnk--> Terminator Salvation</i> as the original T-800 model, alongside <!--del_lnk--> Roland Kickinger. Schwarzenegger denied his involvement, but it was later revealed that although he would appear briefly he would not be shooting new footage, and his image would be inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first Terminator movie.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger's most recent appearance was in Sylvester Stallone's <i><!--del_lnk--> The Expendables</i>, where he made a <!--del_lnk--> cameo appearance alongside Stallone and <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Willis.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_politics">Early politics</span></h3>
       <p>Schwarzenegger has been a registered <!--del_lnk--> Republican for many years. As an actor, his political views were always well-known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a <!--del_lnk--> liberal and <!--del_lnk--> Democratic-leaning community. At the <!--del_lnk--> 2004 Republican National Convention, Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained why he was a Republican:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The <!--del_lnk--> presidential campaign was in full swing. I remember watching the <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Nixon</a>-<!--del_lnk--> Humphrey presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left. But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, "What party is he?" My friend said, "He's a Republican." I said, "Then I am a Republican." And I have been a Republican ever since.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in <i><!--del_lnk--> Stop the Madness</i>, an anti-drug music video sponsored by the <!--del_lnk--> Reagan administration. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the <!--del_lnk--> 1988 Presidential election, accompanying then-<!--del_lnk--> Vice President <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/George_H._W._Bush.htm" title="George H.W. Bush">George H.W. Bush</a> at a campaign rally.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the <!--del_lnk--> President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993. He was nominated by George H. W. Bush, who dubbed him "<!--del_lnk--> Conan the Republican". He later served as Chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor <!--del_lnk--> Pete Wilson. Yet, political analysts have identified Schwarzenegger as a liberal, as he has become more left-leaning since his election.</p>
       <p>Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement.htm" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> ambassador (a mostly ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television/radio <!--del_lnk--> public service announcements to give blood. A small amount of interest was garnered by his wearing of a white t-shirt with the Red Cross on it, while posing with a flexed arm; the image made it into several celebrity magazines.</p>
       <p>In an interview with <i><!--del_lnk--> Talk</i> magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, "I think about it many times. The possibility is there, because I feel it inside." <i><!--del_lnk--> The Hollywood Reporter</i> claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for <!--del_lnk--> governor of California. Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, "I'm in show business&nbsp;&ndash; I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?"</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Governor_of_California">Governor of California</span></h3>
       <p>Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the <!--del_lnk--> 2003 California recall election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003 episode of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i>. As a candidate in the recall election, Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the "Governator" (referring to <i>The Terminator</i> movies, see above) and "The Running Man" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election "Total Recall" (yet another Schwarzenegger starrer). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor <!--del_lnk--> Gray Davis being removed from office with 55.4% of the <i>Yes</i> vote in favour of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Cruz Bustamante, fellow Republican <!--del_lnk--> Tom McClintock, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3&nbsp;million votes. Under the regulations of the <!--del_lnk--> California Constitution, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the first foreign-born governor of California since Irish-born Governor <!--del_lnk--> John G. Downey in 1862.</p>
       <p>As soon as Schwarzenegger was elected governor, <!--del_lnk--> Willie Brown said he would start a drive to recall the governor. Schwarzenegger was equally entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up <!--del_lnk--> gridlock. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch "<!--del_lnk--> Hans and Franz" from <i><!--del_lnk--> Saturday Night Live</i> (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians "<!--del_lnk--> girlie men".</p>

       <p>Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a <!--del_lnk--> special election he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that "no one could win if the opposition raised 160&nbsp;million dollars to defeat you".</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger then went against the advice of fellow Republican strategists and appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. Schwarzenegger gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Phil Angelides, the <!--del_lnk--> California State Treasurer, in the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 elections, held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over one million votes. In recent years, many commentators have seen Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the centre of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther_King%252C_Jr..htm" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> breakfast, San Francisco mayor <!--del_lnk--> Gavin Newsom said that, "[H]e's becoming a Democrat [... H]e's running back, not even to the center. I would say centre-left".</p>
       <p>It was rumored that Schwarzenegger might run for the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. This turned out to be false.</p>

       <p>Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and <!--del_lnk--> bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, "I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential&nbsp;&ndash;I was always fascinated by people in control of other people." Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, "I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and <!--del_lnk--> Sargent Shriver became my heroes." Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of <a href="../../wp/j/John_F._Kennedy.htm" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger. He cannot run for president as he is not a <!--del_lnk--> natural born citizen of the United States. In <i><!--del_lnk--> The Simpsons Movie</i> (2007), he is portrayed as the President, and in the <!--del_lnk--> Sylvester Stallone movie, <i><!--del_lnk--> Demolition Man</i> (1993, ten years before his first run for political office), it is revealed that a constitutional amendment passed which allowed Schwarzenegger to run for President.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger is a dual Austria/United States citizen. He holds Austrian citizenship by birth and has held U.S. citizenship since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European, he was able to win the 2007 <!--del_lnk--> European Voice campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the California <!--del_lnk--> Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other US states and possibly with the EU. Still, Schwarzenegger has always identified with his American citizenship, and has shown great affinity for the state of California beyond his foreign birth.</p>
       <p>Because of his personal wealth from his acting career, Schwarzenegger does not accept his governor's salary of $175,000 per year.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the <!--del_lnk--> Republican primary of the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 U.S. Presidential election was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates <!--del_lnk--> Rudy Giuliani and Senator <a href="../../wp/j/John_McCain.htm" title="John McCain">John McCain</a>, Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the Presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the <!--del_lnk--> Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, "It's Rudy's fault!" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Amendment_of_Three_Strikes_Law">Amendment of Three Strikes Law</span></h4>
       <p>Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing <!--del_lnk--> Proposition 66, a proposed amendment of the Californian <!--del_lnk--> Three Strikes Law, in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, Schwarzenegger launched an intensive campaign against Proposition 66. He stated that "it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists".</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ethics_group_named_Schwarzenegger_one_of_America.27s_worst_governors">Ethics group named Schwarzenegger one of America's worst governors</span></h4>
       <p>In its April 2010 report, <!--del_lnk--> Progressive ethics watchdog group <!--del_lnk--> Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Schwarzenegger one of 11 "worst governors" in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzenegger's term as governor. Some of Schwarzenegger's ethics lapses cited by the watchdog include:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Used non-profit and campaign funds for personal benefit</li>
        <li>Built cozy relationships with special interests</li>
        <li>Created conflicts of interest by accepting a consulting position and doing state business with a company staffed by his former campaign aides</li>
        <li>Provided state jobs to friends with dubious qualifications</li>
        <li>Allegedly pressured government employees to change outcomes</li>
        <li>Did not provide adequate leadership to the state</li>
        <li>Vetoed bills to improve transparency in hospitals at the behest of powerful special interests</li>
       </ul>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_record">Environmental record</span></h3>
       <p>On September 27, 2006 Schwarzenegger signed a bill creating the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990's levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006 allowing California to work with the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan is set to be in effect in 2009. In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his <!--del_lnk--> Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.</p>
       <p>In respect of his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry, Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 <!--del_lnk--> SAE World Congress in Detroit, on April 20, 2009.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Business_career">Business career</span></h2>
       <p>Schwarzenegger has also had a highly successful business career. Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a "prolific goal setter" and would write his objectives at the start of the year on <!--del_lnk--> index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car&nbsp;&ndash; and succeed in doing so. By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from a series of successful business ventures and investments. In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder <!--del_lnk--> Franco Columbu started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the <!--del_lnk--> 1971 San Fernando earthquake. Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes. Schwarzenegger rolled profits from the mail order business and his bodybuilding competition winnings into his first real estate venture: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000. He would go on to invest in a number of real estate holding companies. In 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in <!--del_lnk--> Santa Monica called <i>Schatzi On Main</i>. <i>Schatzi</i> literally means "little treasure," colloquial for "honey" or "darling" in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant. He invested in a shopping mall in <!--del_lnk--> Columbus, Ohio. He has talked about some of those who have helped him over the years in business: "I couldn't have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from <!--del_lnk--> Milton Friedman to <!--del_lnk--> Donald Trump... and now, <!--del_lnk--> Les Wexner and <!--del_lnk--> Warren Buffett. I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood, such as when to get out! And I did!" He has significant ownership in <!--del_lnk--> Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment firm.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Planet_Hollywood">Planet Hollywood</span></h3>
       <p>Schwarzenegger was a founding celebrity investor in the <!--del_lnk--> Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the <!--del_lnk--> Hard Rock Cafe) along with <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Willis, <!--del_lnk--> Sylvester Stallone, and <!--del_lnk--> Demi Moore. Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the business in early 2000. Schwarzenegger said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on "new US global business ventures" and his movie career.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Net_worth">Net worth</span></h3>
       <p>Schwarzenegger's net worth has been conservatively estimated at between $100&ndash;$200&nbsp;million. Over the years, he invested his <!--del_lnk--> bodybuilding and movie earnings in an array of <!--del_lnk--> stocks, <!--del_lnk--> bonds, privately controlled companies, and <!--del_lnk--> real estate holdings worldwide, so a more accurate estimation of his net worth is difficult to calculate, particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to economic recessions in the USA and Europe. In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38&nbsp;million of his own money on a private Gulfstream Jet. Schwarzenegger once said of his fortune, "Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50&nbsp;million, but I was just as happy when I had $48&nbsp;million." He has also stated, "I've made many millions as a businessman many times over."</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>On April 26, 1986, Schwarzenegger married television journalist <!--del_lnk--> Maria Shriver, niece of President <a href="../../wp/j/John_F._Kennedy.htm" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, in <!--del_lnk--> Hyannis, Massachusetts. The Rev. John Baptist Riordan performed the ceremony at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church. They have four children: <!--del_lnk--> Katherine Eunice Shriver Schwarzenegger (born December 13, 1989 in Los Angeles); Christina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born July 23, 1991 in Los Angeles); Patrick Arnold Schwarzenegger (born September 18, 1993 in Los Angeles); and Christopher Sargent Shriver Schwarzenegger (born September 27, 1997 in Los Angeles).</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger and his family currently live in their 11,000-square-foot (1,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) home in <!--del_lnk--> Brentwood. They used to own a home in the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Palisades. The family owns vacation homes in <!--del_lnk--> Sun Valley, Idaho and <!--del_lnk--> Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.</p>
       <p>On Sundays, the family attends <!--del_lnk--> Mass at <!--del_lnk--> St. Monica's Catholic Church.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger has said he believes the secret of a good marriage is love and respect. <i>"If you have the ultimate love for your wife and she has it for you, I think you have a great head start ... That's not to say it won't be difficult sometimes. You go through your ups and downs but you work through it."</i> Schwarzenegger has talked about parenthood in 2000: <i>"One of the best things you can do with your children is play with them. At the same time, I act very silly. Many times I do a lot of sports with them. I play games with them. Act out parts. We do little plays, sometimes."</i></p>
       <p>His official height of 6'2" has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be 6'1.5", a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders. However, in 1988 both the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>Time Out</i> magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter. More recently, before running for Governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Chicago Reader</i>. As Governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, <i>"[s]ettle this once and for all and find out how tall he is"</i> by using a tailor's tape measure on the Governor. Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words "Need a lift?" on the five-foot-five inch (165&nbsp;cm) Wesson's chair before a negotiating session in his office. <!--del_lnk--> Bob Mulholland also claimed Arnold was 5'10" and that he wore risers in his boots. The debate on Schwarzenegger's height has spawned a website solely dedicated to the issue, and his page remains one of the most active on CelebHeights.com, a website which discusses the heights of celebrities.</p>
       <p>In 2005, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Pilz, from the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian Green Party, demanded that parliament revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship. This demand was based on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act that states: <i>A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic</i>. Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights.htm" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>) had indeed done damage to Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as Governor of California was to prevent an error in the judicial system.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger's home town of <!--del_lnk--> Graz had its soccer stadium named <i>The Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium</i> in his honour. It is the home of both <!--del_lnk--> Grazer AK and <!--del_lnk--> Sturm Graz. Following the <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Williams execution and after street protests in his hometown, several local politicians began a campaign to remove Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium. Schwarzenegger responded, saying that <i>"to spare the responsible politicians of the city of Graz further concern, I withdraw from them as of this day the right to use my name in association with the Liebenau Stadium"</i>, and set a tight deadline of just a couple of days to remove his name. Graz officials removed Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium in December 2005. It is now officially titled <!--del_lnk--> UPC-Arena.</p>
       <p>The Sun Valley Resort has a short ski trail called <i>Arnold's Run</i>, named after Schwarzenegger (It was named after him in 2001). The trail is categorized as a black diamond, or most difficult, for its terrain.</p>
       <p>He bought the first Hummer manufactured for civilian use in 1992, a model so large, 6,300&nbsp;lbs and 7 feet (2.1&nbsp;m) wide, that it is classified as a large truck and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to it. During the Gubernatorial Recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about US$21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network, and gained a <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost. California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.</p>
       <p>People in <!--del_lnk--> Thal celebrated Schwarzenegger's 60th birthday by throwing a party. Officials proclaimed A Day for Arnold on July 30, 2007. Thal 145, the number of the house where Schwarzenegger was born, belonged to Schwarzenegger and no one will ever be assigned to that number.</p>
       <p>On February 12, 2010, Schwarzenegger was the 18th runner on the 106th day of the Vancouver Olympic Torch relay. His leg was along the <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Park Seawall, and he exchanged a "torch kiss" with the next runner, <a href="../../wp/s/Sebastian_Coe.htm" title="Sebastian Coe">Sebastian Coe</a>.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Accidents_and_injuries">Accidents and injuries</span></h3>
       <p>Schwarzenegger broke his right <!--del_lnk--> femur while skiing in <!--del_lnk--> Sun Valley, Idaho with his family on December 23, 2006. He tripped over his ski pole on Lower Warm Springs run on Bald Mountain, an 'easy' or green level run. He is an expert level skier. On December 26, 2006, he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from the <!--del_lnk--> St. John's Health Centre on December 30, 2006. Schwarzenegger did not delay his second oath of office on January 5, 2007, although he was still on crutches at the time.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger has twice crashed motorcycles on public highways, injuring himself in the process. On January 8, 2006, while riding his <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Harley-Davidson.htm" title="Harley Davidson">Harley Davidson</a> motorcycle in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, the governor sustained a minor injury to his lip, forcing him to get 15 stitches. "No citations were issued", said Officer Jason Lee, a <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. Schwarzenegger, who famously rode motorcycles in <!--del_lnk--> the <i>Terminator</i> movies, has never obtained an M-1 or M-2 endorsement on his California driver's license that would allow him to legally ride a motorcycle without a sidecar on the street. Previously, on December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger was born with a <!--del_lnk--> bicuspid aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets). Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.</p>
       <p>He saved a drowning man's life in 2004 while on vacation in Hawaii by swimming out and bringing him back to shore.</p>
       <p>Schwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at <!--del_lnk--> Van Nuys Airport on June 19, 2009 after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by the governor's press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident.</p>
