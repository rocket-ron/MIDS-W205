       <p><b>Abstract art</b> uses a <!--del_lnk--> visual language of form, colour and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world. <!--del_lnk--> Western art had been, from the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of <!--del_lnk--> perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.</p>
       <p>Abstract art, nonfigurative art, nonobjective art, and nonrepresentational art are loosely related terms. They are similar, although perhaps not of identical meaning.</p>
       <p>Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of <!--del_lnk--> imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be only slight, or it can be partial, or it can be complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance colour and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In <!--del_lnk--> geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. <!--del_lnk--> Figurative art and total abstraction are almost <!--del_lnk--> mutually exclusive. But <!--del_lnk--> figurative and <!--del_lnk--> representational (or <!--del_lnk--> realistic) art often contains partial abstraction.</p>
       <p>Both <!--del_lnk--> Geometric abstraction and <!--del_lnk--> Lyrical Abstraction are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous <!--del_lnk--> art movements that embody partial abstraction would be for instance <!--del_lnk--> fauvism in which colour is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">cubism</a>, which blatantly alters the forms of the real life entities depicted.</p>

       <p>Much of the art of earlier cultures &ndash; signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock &ndash; were simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or decorative purpose. It is at this level of visual meaning that abstract art communicates. One can enjoy the beauty of <!--del_lnk--> Chinese calligraphy or <!--del_lnk--> Islamic calligraphy without being able to read it.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="19th_century">19th century</span></h3>

Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists.</p>

A near abstraction, in 1877 Whistler sued the <!--del_lnk--> art critic <!--del_lnk--> John Ruskin for libel after the critic condemned his painting <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket</i>. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face." </div>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Early intimations of a new art had been made by <!--del_lnk--> James McNeill Whistler who, in his painting <i><!--del_lnk--> Nocturne in Black and Gold: The falling Rocket,</i> (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects. An <i>objective interest in what is seen,</i> can be discerned from the paintings of <a href="../../wp/j/John_Constable.htm" title="John Constable">John Constable</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/J._M._W._Turner.htm" title="J M W Turner">J M W Turner</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Camille Corot and from them to the Impressionists who continued the <i><!--del_lnk--> plein air</i> painting of the <!--del_lnk--> Barbizon school. <!--del_lnk--> Paul C&eacute;zanne had begun as an Impressionist but his aim - to make a logical construction of reality based on a view from a single point , with modulated colour in flat areas - became the basis of a new visual art, later to be developed into <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">Cubism</a> by <!--del_lnk--> George Braque and <a href="../../wp/p/Pablo_Picasso.htm" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/e/Expressionism.htm" title="Expressionism">Expressionist</a> painters explored the bold use of paint surface, drawing distortions and exaggerations, and intense colour. Expressionists produced emotionally charged paintings that were reactions to and perceptions of contemporary experience; and reactions to <a href="../../wp/i/Impressionism.htm" title="Impressionism">Impressionism</a> and other more conservative directions of late 19th century painting. The Expressionists also drastically changed the emphasis on subject matter in favour of the portrayal of psychological states of being. Although artists like <!--del_lnk--> Edvard Munch and <!--del_lnk--> James Ensor drew influences principally from the work of the <!--del_lnk--> Post-Impressionists they were instrumental to the advent of abstraction in the 20th century.</p>

       <p>Additionally in the late 19th century in Eastern Europe <a href="../../wp/m/Mysticism.htm" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a> and early <!--del_lnk--> modernist religious philosophy as expressed by <!--del_lnk--> theosophist <!--del_lnk--> Mme. Blavatsky had a profound impact on pioneer <!--del_lnk--> geometric artists like <!--del_lnk--> Wassily Kandinsky, and <!--del_lnk--> Hilma af Klint. The mystical teaching of <!--del_lnk--> Georges Gurdjieff and <!--del_lnk--> P.D. Ouspensky also had an important influence on the early formations of the geometric abstract styles of <!--del_lnk--> Piet Mondrian and his colleagues in the early 20th century.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_century">20th century</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Post Impressionism as practiced by <!--del_lnk--> Paul Gauguin, <!--del_lnk--> Georges Seurat, <a href="../../wp/v/Vincent_van_Gogh.htm" title="Vincent van Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Paul C&eacute;zanne had an enormous impact on <!--del_lnk--> 20th century art and led to the advent of 20th century abstraction. The heritage of painters like <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/v/Vincent_van_Gogh.htm" title="Van Gogh">Van Gogh</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Paul_C%25C3%25A9zanne.htm" title="C&eacute;zanne">C&eacute;zanne</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Gauguin, and <!--del_lnk--> Seurat was essential for the development of <!--del_lnk--> modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century <a href="../../wp/h/Henri_Matisse.htm" title="Henri Matisse">Henri Matisse</a> and several other young artists including the pre-cubist <!--del_lnk--> Georges Braque, <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute; Derain, <!--del_lnk--> Raoul Dufy and <!--del_lnk--> Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called <!--del_lnk--> Fauvism. With his expressive use of colour and his free and imaginative drawing Henri Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction in <i>French Window at <!--del_lnk--> Collioure,</i> (1914), <i><!--del_lnk--> View of Notre-Dame,</i> (1914), and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Yellow Curtain</i> from 1915. The raw language of colour as developed by the <!--del_lnk--> Fauves directly influenced another pioneer of abstraction <!--del_lnk--> Wassily Kandinsky (see illustration).</p>
       <p>Although <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">Cubism</a> ultimately depends upon subject matter, it became, along with <!--del_lnk--> Fauvism, the art movement that directly opened the door to abstraction in the 20th century. <a href="../../wp/p/Pablo_Picasso.htm" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> made his first <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">cubist</a> paintings based on C&eacute;zanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: <a href="../../wp/c/Cube.htm" title="Cube">cube</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sphere.htm" title="Sphere">sphere</a> and <!--del_lnk--> cone. With the painting <!--del_lnk--> Les Demoiselles d'Avignon 1907, Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of <!--del_lnk--> African tribal masks and his own new <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubist">Cubist</a> inventions. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Analytic cubism">Analytic cubism</a> was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and <!--del_lnk--> Georges Braque, from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Synthetic cubism">Synthetic cubism</a>, practised by Braque, Picasso, <!--del_lnk--> Fernand L&eacute;ger, <!--del_lnk--> Juan Gris, <!--del_lnk--> Albert Gleizes, <!--del_lnk--> Marcel Duchamp and countless other artists into the 1920s. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Synthetic cubism">Synthetic cubism</a> is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, <!--del_lnk--> collage elements, <!--del_lnk--> papier coll&eacute; and a large variety of merged subject matter. The collage artists like <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Schwitters and <!--del_lnk--> Man Ray and others taking the <!--del_lnk--> clue from <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">Cubism</a> were instrumental to the development of the movement called <a href="../../wp/d/Dada.htm" title="Dada">Dada</a>.</p>
       <p>The Italian poet <!--del_lnk--> Marinetti published 'The Founding and Manifesto of <!--del_lnk--> Futurism'in 1909, which inspired artists such as <!--del_lnk--> Carlo Carra in,'Painting of Sounds, Noises and Smells' and <!--del_lnk--> Umberto Boccioni 'Train in Motion',1911, to a further stage of abstraction and profoundly influenced art movements throughout Europe.</p>
       <p>In 1913 the poet <!--del_lnk--> Guillaume Appollinaire named the work of Robert and Sonia Delaunay, <!--del_lnk--> Orphism. He defined it as, <i>the art of painting new structures out of elements that have not been borrowed from the visual sphere, but had been created entirely by the artist...it is a pure art.</i></p>
       <p>Since the turn of the century cultural connections between artists of the major European and American cities had become extremely active as they strove to create an art form equal to the high aspirations of <!--del_lnk--> Modernism. Ideas were able to cross-fertilize by means of artists books, exhibitions and <!--del_lnk--> manifestos so that many sources were open to experimentation and discussion, and formed a basis for a diversity of modes of abstraction. The following extract from,'The World Backwards', gives some impression of the inter-connectedness of culture at the time:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>' <!--del_lnk--> David Burliuk's knowledge of modern art movements must have been extremely up-to-date, for the second <!--del_lnk--> Knave of Diamonds exhibition, held in January 1912 (in Moscow) included not only paintings sent from Munich, but some members of the German <!--del_lnk--> Die Br&uuml;cke group, while from Paris came work by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Delaunay, <a href="../../wp/h/Henri_Matisse.htm" title="Henri Matisse">Henri Matisse</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Fernand L&eacute;ger, as well as Picasso. During the Spring David Burliuk gave two lectures on cubism and planned a polemical publication, which the Knave of Diamonds was to finance. He went abroad in May and came back determined to rival the almanac <!--del_lnk--> Der Blaue Reiter which had emerged from the printers while he was in Germany'.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>By 1911 many experimental works in the search for this 'pure art' had been created. <!--del_lnk--> Franti&scaron;ek Kupka had painted the Orphist work,'Discs of Newton'.The <!--del_lnk--> Rayist (Luchizm) drawings of <!--del_lnk--> Natalia Goncharova and <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Larionov, used lines like rays of light to make a construction. <!--del_lnk--> Kasimir Malevich completed his first entirely abstract work, the <!--del_lnk--> Suprematist, 'Black Square', in 1915. Another of the Suprematist group' <!--del_lnk--> Liubov Popova, created the Architectonic Constructions and Spatial Force Constructions between 1916 and 1921. <!--del_lnk--> Piet Mondrian was evolving his abstract language, of horizontal and vertical lines with rectangles of colour, between 1915 and 1919, Neo-Plasticism was the aesthetic which Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and other in the group <!--del_lnk--> De Stijl intended to reshape the environment of the future.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Music">Music</span></h3>
       <div class="thumb tright">
       </div>
       <p>Visual art, as it becomes more abstract becomes more like <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>: an art form which uses the abstract elements of sound and divisions of time. <!--del_lnk--> Wassily Kandinsky, himself a musician, was inspired by the possibility of marks and associative colour <i>resounding in the soul.</i> The idea had been put forward by <!--del_lnk--> Charles Baudelaire, that all our senses respond to various stimuli but the senses are connected at a deeper aesthetic level.</p>
       <p>Closely related to this, is the idea that art has <i>The spiritual dimension</i> and can transcend 'every-day' experience, reaching a spiritual plane. The <!--del_lnk--> Theosophical Society popularised the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of India and China in the early years of the century. It was in this context that <!--del_lnk--> Piet Mondrian, <!--del_lnk--> Wassily Kandinsky, <!--del_lnk--> Hilma af Klint and other artists working towards an 'objectless state' became interested in the occult as a way of creating an 'inner' object. The universal and timeless shapes found in <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">Geometry</a>: the circle, square and triangle become the spacial elements in abstract art; they are, like colour, fundamental systems underlying visible reality.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Russian_avant-garde">Russian avant-garde</span></h3>
       <p>Many of the abstract artists in Russia became <a href="../../wp/c/Constructivism_%2528art%2529.htm" title="Constructivism (art)">Constructivists</a> believing that art was no longer something remote, but life itself. The artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. <i>Art into life!</i> was <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Tatlin's slogan, and that of all the future Constructivists. <!--del_lnk--> Varvara Stepanova and Alexandre Exter and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works. On the other side stood <!--del_lnk--> Kazimir Malevich, <!--del_lnk--> Anton Pevsner and <!--del_lnk--> Naum Gabo. They argued that art was essentially a spiritual activity; to create the individual's place in the world, not to organise life in a practical, materialistic sense. Many of those who were hostile to the materialist production idea of art left Russia. Anton Pevsner went to France, Gabo went first to Berlin, then to England and finally to America. Kandinsky studied in Moscow then left for the <!--del_lnk--> Bauhaus. By the mid-1920s the revolutionary period (1917 to 1921) when artists had been free to experiment was over; and by the 1930s only <!--del_lnk--> social realist art was allowed.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Bauhaus">The Bauhaus</span></h3>
       <p>The Bauhaus at Weimar, Germany was founded in 1919 by <!--del_lnk--> Walter Gropius. The philosophy underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. This philosophy had grown from the ideas of the <!--del_lnk--> Arts and Crafts movement in England and the Deutsche Werkbund. Among the teachers were <!--del_lnk--> Paul Klee, <!--del_lnk--> Wassily Kandinsky, <!--del_lnk--> Johannes Itten, <!--del_lnk--> Josef Albers, <!--del_lnk--> Anni Albers, <!--del_lnk--> Theo van Doesburg and <!--del_lnk--> Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. In 1925 the school was moved to Dessau and, as the <!--del_lnk--> Nazi party gained control in 1932, The Bauhaus was closed. In 1937 an exhibition of <!--del_lnk--> degenerate art, 'Entartete Kunst' contained all types of <!--del_lnk--> avant-garde art disapproved of by the Nazi party. Then the exodus began: not just from the Bauhaus but from Europe in general; to Paris, London and America. Paul Klee went to Switzerland but many of the artists at the Bauhaus went to America.</p>

       </div>
       <p>During the 1930s Paris became the host to artists from Russia, Germany, Holland and other European countries affected by the rise of <!--del_lnk--> totalitarianism. <!--del_lnk--> Sophie Tauber and <!--del_lnk--> Jean Arp collaborated on paintings and sculpture using organic/geometric forms. The Polish <!--del_lnk--> Katarzyna Kobro applied mathematically based ideas to sculpture. The many types of abstraction now in close proximity led to attempts by artists to analyse the various conceptual and aesthetic groupings. An exhibition by forty-six members of the Cercle et Carr&eacute; group organised by <!--del_lnk--> Michel Seuphor  contained work by the Neo-Plasticists as well as abstractionists as varied as Kandinsky, Anton Pevsner and <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Schwitters. Criticised by <!--del_lnk--> Theo van Doesburg to be too indefinite a collection he publish the journal <i>Art Concret</i> setting out a manifesto defining an abstract art in which the line, colour and surface only, are the concrete reality. Abstraction-Cr&eacute;ation founded in 1931 as a more open group, provided a point of reference for abstract artists, as the political situation worsened in 1935, and artists again regrouped, many in London. The first exhibition of British abstract art was held in England in 1935. The following year the more international <i>Abstract and Concrete</i> exhibition was organised by <!--del_lnk--> Nicolete Gray including work by <!--del_lnk--> Piet Mondrian, <!--del_lnk--> Joan Mir&oacute;, <!--del_lnk--> Barbara Hepworth and <!--del_lnk--> Ben Nicholson. Hepworth, Nicholson and Gabo moved to the <!--del_lnk--> St. Ives group in Cornwall to continue their 'constructivist' work.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="America:_Mid-Century">America: Mid-Century</span></h3>
       <p>During the Nazi rise to power in the 1930s many artists fled Europe to the United States. By the early 1940s the main movements in modern art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, <!--del_lnk--> surrealism, and <a href="../../wp/d/Dada.htm" title="Dada">dada</a> were represented in New York: <!--del_lnk--> Marcel Duchamp, <!--del_lnk--> Fernand L&eacute;ger, <!--del_lnk--> Piet Mondrian, <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Lipchitz, <!--del_lnk--> Max Ernst, <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute; Breton, were just a few of the exiled Europeans who arrived in <!--del_lnk--> New York.. The rich cultural influences brought by the European artists were distilled and built upon by local New York painters. The climate of freedom in New York allowed all of these influences to flourish. The art galleries that primarily had focused on European art began to notice the local art community and the work of younger American artists who had begun to mature. Certain of these artists became distinctly abstract in their mature work. Some artists of the period defied categorization, such as <a href="../../wp/g/Georgia_O%2527Keeffe.htm" title="Georgia O'Keeffe">Georgia O'Keeffe</a> who, while a modernist abstractionist, was a pure maverick in that she painted highly abstract forms while not joining any specific group of the period. Eventually American artists who were working in a great diversity of styles began to coalesce into cohesive stylistic groups. The best known group of American artists became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Abstract expressionists and the <!--del_lnk--> New York School. In New York City there was an atmosphere which encouraged discussion and there was new opportunity for learning and growing. Artists and teachers <!--del_lnk--> John D. Graham and <!--del_lnk--> Hans Hofmann became important bridge figures between the newly arrived European Modernists and the younger American artists coming of age. <a href="../../wp/m/Mark_Rothko.htm" title="Mark Rothko">Mark Rothko</a>, born in Russia, began with strongly surrealist imagery which later dissolved into his powerful colour compositions of the early 1950s. The <!--del_lnk--> expressionistic gesture and the act of painting itself, became of primary importance to <a href="../../wp/j/Jackson_Pollock.htm" title="Jackson Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Franz Kline. While during the 1940s <!--del_lnk--> Arshile Gorky's and <!--del_lnk--> Willem de Kooning's figurative work evolved into abstraction by the end of the decade. New York City became the centre, and artists worldwide gravitated towards it; from other places in America as well.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Abstraction_in_the_21st_century">Abstraction in the 21st century</span></h2>
       <p>A commonly held idea is that <!--del_lnk--> pluralism characterizes art at the beginning of the 21st century. The "crisis" in painting and current art and current <!--del_lnk--> art criticism today is brought about by <!--del_lnk--> pluralism. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an <i>anything goes</i> attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic <!--del_lnk--> superhighway filled to capacity. Consequently magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit.</p>
