It is a colourless <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gas</a> with a characteristic <!--del_lnk--> pungent <!--del_lnk--> smell. Ammonia contributes significantly to the <a href="../../wp/n/Nutrition.htm" title="Nutrition">nutritional</a> needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to <a href="../../wp/f/Food.htm" title="Food">food</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building-block for the synthesis of many <!--del_lnk--> pharmaceuticals and is used in many commercial cleaning products. Although in wide use, ammonia is both <!--del_lnk--> caustic and <!--del_lnk--> hazardous. The global production of ammonia for 2012 is anticipated to be 198 million tonnes, a 35% increase over the estimated 2006 global output of 146.5 million tonnes.</p>
       <p>Ammonia, as used commercially, is often called <i>anhydrous ammonia.</i> This term emphasizes the absence of water in the material. Because NH<sub>3</sub> boils at &minus;33.34&nbsp;&deg;C (&minus;28.012&nbsp;&deg;F) at a pressure of 1 atmosphere, the liquid must be stored under high pressure or at low temperature. Household ammonia or <!--del_lnk--> ammonium hydroxide is a solution of NH<sub>3</sub> in water. The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the <!--del_lnk--> Baum&eacute; scale (<a href="../../wp/d/Density.htm" title="Density">density</a>), with 26 degrees baum&eacute; (about 30% (by weight) ammonia at 15.5&nbsp;&deg;C) being the typical high-concentration commercial product.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_occurrence">Natural occurrence</span></h2>
       <p>Ammonia is found in trace quantities in the atmosphere, being produced from the <!--del_lnk--> putrefaction (decay process) of nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, whereas <!--del_lnk--> ammonium chloride (sal-ammoniac), and <!--del_lnk--> ammonium sulfate are found in volcanic districts; crystals of <!--del_lnk--> ammonium bicarbonate have been found in <!--del_lnk--> Patagonian <!--del_lnk--> guano. The <a href="../../wp/k/Kidney.htm" title="Kidney">kidneys</a> secrete NH<sub>3</sub> to neutralize excess acid. Ammonium salts also are found distributed through all fertile soil and in seawater. Substances containing ammonia, or those that are similar to it, are called <i>ammoniacal</i>. Ammonia is found on <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter.htm" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and, in small amounts, on <a href="../../wp/u/Uranus.htm" title="Uranus">Uranus</a>.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Structure">Structure</span></h3>
       <p>The ammonia molecule has a <!--del_lnk--> trigonal pyramidal shape with a bond angle of 107.8&deg;, as predicted by the <!--del_lnk--> valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory). The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one lone pair of electrons. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5&deg;, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but is measured at 107.8&deg;. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a <!--del_lnk--> lone electron pair, which makes ammonia a <!--del_lnk--> base, a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a <!--del_lnk--> dipole moment and makes it <!--del_lnk--> polar. The molecule's polarity and, especially, its ability to form <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen bonds, makes ammonia highly miscible with <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Properties_of_water.htm" title="Water (molecule)">water</a>. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are <!--del_lnk--> protonated. Temperature and <!--del_lnk--> salinity also affect the proportion of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. The latter has the shape of a regular <a href="../../wp/t/Tetrahedron.htm" title="Tetrahedron">tetrahedron</a> and is <!--del_lnk--> isoelectronic with <a href="../../wp/m/Methane.htm" title="Methane">methane</a>. It is known to have the highest <!--del_lnk--> specific heat capacity of any substance.</p>
       <p>The ammonia molecule readily undergoes <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen inversion at room temperature; a useful analogy is an <a href="../../wp/u/Umbrella.htm" title="Umbrella">umbrella</a> turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the <!--del_lnk--> resonance frequency is 23.79 <!--del_lnk--> GHz, corresponding to <!--del_lnk--> microwave radiation of a <!--del_lnk--> wavelength of 1.260&nbsp;cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first <!--del_lnk--> microwave spectrum to be observed.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Basicity">Basicity</span></h3>
       <p>One of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its <!--del_lnk--> basicity. It combines with <a href="../../wp/a/Acid.htm" title="Acid">acids</a> to form <a href="../../wp/s/Salt_%2528chemistry%2529.htm" title="Salt (chemistry)">salts</a>; thus with <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrochloric_acid.htm" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acid</a> it forms <!--del_lnk--> ammonium chloride (sal-ammoniac); with <a href="../../wp/n/Nitric_acid.htm" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ammonium nitrate, etc. However, perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen chloride; moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction. As a demonstration experiment, opened bottles of concentrated ammonia and hydrochloric acid produce clouds of ammonium chloride, which seem to appear "out of nothing" as the salt forms where the two diffusing clouds of molecules meet, somewhere between the two bottles.</p>

        <dd>NH<sub>3</sub> + HCl &rarr; NH<sub>4</sub>Cl</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>The salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the <!--del_lnk--> ammonium salts and all contain the <!--del_lnk--> ammonium ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>). Dilute aqueous ammonia can be applied on the skin to lessen the effects of acidic animal venoms, such as from insects and <!--del_lnk--> jellyfish.</p>
       <p>The basicity of ammonia also is the basis of its toxicity and its use as a <a href="#Cleaner">cleaner</a>.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>By creating a solution with a pH much higher than a neutral water solution, proteins (<!--del_lnk--> enzymes) will denaturate, leading to cell damage, death of the cell, and eventually death of the organism.</li>
        <li>Dirt often consists of fats and oils, which are sparingly soluble in water. Ammonia brings them into aqueous solution. The remaining water, also containing excess ammonia, will evaporate completely, leaving a clean surface.</li>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Acidity">Acidity</span></h3>
       <p>Although ammonia is well known as a weak base, it can also act as an extremely weak acid. It is a protic substance and is capable of formation of <!--del_lnk--> amides (which contain the NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> ion). For example, <a href="../../wp/l/Lithium.htm" title="Lithium">lithium</a> dissolves in liquid ammonia to give a solution of <!--del_lnk--> lithium amide:</p>

       <p>In <a href="../../wp/o/Organic_chemistry.htm" title="Organic chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, ammonia can act as a <!--del_lnk--> nucleophile in <a href="../../wp/n/Nucleophilic_substitution.htm" title="Nucleophilic substitution">substitution</a> reactions. <a href="../../wp/a/Amine.htm" title="Amine">Amines</a> can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with <!--del_lnk--> alkyl halides, although the resulting -NH<sub>2</sub> group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen halide formed. <!--del_lnk--> Methylamine is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with <!--del_lnk--> chloromethane, and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare <!--del_lnk--> racemic <!--del_lnk--> alanine in 70% yield. <!--del_lnk--> Ethanolamine is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with <!--del_lnk--> ethylene oxide: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce <!--del_lnk--> diethanolamine and <!--del_lnk--> triethanolamine.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Amides can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with a number of <a href="../../wp/c/Carboxylic_acid.htm" title="Carboxylic acid">carboxylic acid</a> derivatives. <!--del_lnk--> Acyl chlorides are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen chloride formed. <!--del_lnk--> Esters and <!--del_lnk--> anhydrides also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be <!--del_lnk--> dehydrated to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150&ndash;200&nbsp;&deg;C are required.</p>
       <p>The hydrogen in ammonia is capable of replacement by <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metals</a>, thus <a href="../../wp/m/Magnesium.htm" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> burns in the gas with the formation of <!--del_lnk--> magnesium nitride Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, and when the gas is passed over heated <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium.htm" title="Sodium">sodium</a> or <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>, sodamide, NaNH<sub>2</sub>, and potassamide, KNH<sub>2</sub>, are formed.

       <p>Ammonia can act as a <!--del_lnk--> ligand in <a href="../../wp/t/Transition_metal.htm" title="Transition metal">transition metal</a> <!--del_lnk--> complexes. It is a pure &sigma;-donor, in the middle of the <!--del_lnk--> spectrochemical series, and shows intermediate <!--del_lnk--> hard-soft behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named <b>ammine</b> in the nomenclature of <!--del_lnk--> coordination compounds. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) ([Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to solution of copper(II) salts. It is known as <!--del_lnk--> Schweizer's reagent. Diamminesilver(I) ([Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>) is the active species in <!--del_lnk--> Tollens' reagent. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: <!--del_lnk--> silver chloride (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, <!--del_lnk--> silver bromide (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution, whereas <!--del_lnk--> silver iodide (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia.</p>
       <p>Ammine complexes of <a href="../../wp/c/Chromium.htm" title="Chromium">chromium</a>(III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Werner's revolutionary theory on the structure of coordination compounds. Werner noted only two isomers (<i>fac</i>- and <i>mer</i>-) of the complex [CrCl<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] could be formed, and concluded the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the <!--del_lnk--> vertices of an <a href="../../wp/o/Octahedron.htm" title="Octahedron">octahedron</a>. This proposal has since been confirmed by <!--del_lnk--> X-ray crystallography.</p>
       <p>An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare. One example is the <!--del_lnk--> Calomel reaction, where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.</p>

       <p>The Romans called the ammonium chloride deposits they collected from near the Temple of <!--del_lnk--> Amun (<a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a> &#x1F0C;&mu;&mu;&omega;&nu; <i>Ammon</i>) in <!--del_lnk--> ancient Libya 'sal ammoniacus' (salt of Amun) because of proximity to the nearby temple. Salts of ammonia have been known from very early times; thus the term <i>Hammoniacus sal</i> appears in the writings of <!--del_lnk--> Pliny, although it is not known whether the term is identical with the more modern <i>sal-ammoniac</i> (<!--del_lnk--> ammonium chloride).</p>
       <p>In the form of sal-ammoniac <i>(nushadir)</i> ammonia was important to the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim alchemists as early as the 8th century, first mentioned by the Persian chemist <!--del_lnk--> J&#x101;bir ibn Hayy&#x101;n, and to the European <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemists</a> since the 13th century, being mentioned by <!--del_lnk--> Albertus Magnus. It was also used by <!--del_lnk--> dyers in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> in the form of fermented <!--del_lnk--> urine to alter the colour of vegetable dyes. In the 15th century, <!--del_lnk--> Basilius Valentinus showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on sal-ammoniac. At a later period, when sal-ammoniac was obtained by distilling the hooves and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrochloric_acid.htm" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acid</a>, the name "spirit of hartshorn" was applied to ammonia.</p>
       <p>Gaseous ammonia was first isolated by <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Priestley in 1774 and was termed by him "alkaline air". Eleven years later in 1785, <!--del_lnk--> Claude Louis Berthollet ascertained its composition.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Haber-Bosch process to produce ammonia from the nitrogen in the air was developed by <!--del_lnk--> Fritz Haber and <!--del_lnk--> Carl Bosch in 1909 and patented in 1910. It was first used on an industrial scale by the Germans during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, following the allied blockade that cut off the supply of nitrates from <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>. The ammonia was used to produce explosives to sustain their war effort.</p>
       <p>Prior to the availability of cheap natural gas, hydrogen as a precursor to <!--del_lnk--> ammonia production was produced via the <a href="../../wp/e/Electrolysis.htm" title="Electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of water or using the <!--del_lnk--> chloralkali process.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses">Uses</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fertilizer">Fertilizer</span></h3>
       <p>Approximately 83% (as of 2004) of ammonia is used as fertilisers either as its salts, solutions or anhydrously. When applied to soil, it helps provide increased yields of crops such as maize and wheat. 30&nbsp;% of agricultural nitrogen applied in the USA is in the form of anhydrous ammonia and worldwide 110m tonnes are applied each year.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Precursor_to_nitrogenous_compounds">Precursor to nitrogenous compounds</span></h3>
       <p>Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. An important derivative is <a href="../../wp/n/Nitric_acid.htm" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a>. This key material is generated via the <!--del_lnk--> Ostwald process by <!--del_lnk--> oxidation of ammonia with air over a <a href="../../wp/p/Platinum.htm" title="Platinum">platinum</a> catalyst at 700&ndash;850&nbsp;&deg;C, ~9 atm. <!--del_lnk--> Nitric oxide is an intermediate in this conversion:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>NH<sub>3</sub> + 2 O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; HNO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>Nitric acid is used for the production of <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>, <!--del_lnk--> explosives, and many organonitrogen compounds.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cleaner">Cleaner</span></h3>
       <p>Household ammonia is a solution of NH<sub>3</sub> in water (i.e., <!--del_lnk--> ammonium hydroxide) used as a general purpose cleaner for many surfaces. Because ammonia results in a relatively streak-free shine, one of its most common uses is to clean glass, porcelain and stainless steel. It is also frequently used for cleaning ovens and soaking items to loosen baked-on grime. Household ammonia ranges in concentration by weight from 5 to 10% ammonia.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fermentation">Fermentation</span></h3>
       <p>Solutions of ammonia ranging from 16% to 25% are used in the <!--del_lnk--> fermentation industry as a source of nitrogen for microorganisms and to adjust pH during fermentation.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Antimicrobial_agent_for_food_products">Antimicrobial agent for food products</span></h3>
       <p>As early as in 1895, it was known that ammonia was "strongly <!--del_lnk--> antiseptic ... it requires 1.4 grams per litre to preserve <!--del_lnk--> beef tea." Anhydrous ammonia has been shown effective as an <!--del_lnk--> antimicrobial agent for <!--del_lnk--> animal feed and is currently used commercially to reduce or eliminate <!--del_lnk--> microbial contamination of <a href="../../wp/b/Beef.htm" title="Beef">beef</a>. <!--del_lnk--> The New York Times reported in October, 2009 on an American company, <!--del_lnk--> Beef Products Inc., which turns fatty <!--del_lnk--> beef trimmings, averaging between 50 and 70 percent fat, into seven million pounds per week of <!--del_lnk--> lean finely textured beef ("pink slime") by removing the fat using heat and <!--del_lnk--> centrifugation, then disinfecting the lean product with ammonia; the process was rated by the <!--del_lnk--> US Department of Agriculture as effective and safe on the basis of a study (financed by Beef Products) that found that the treatment reduces <i><!--del_lnk--> E. coli</i> to undetectable levels. Further investigation by <i>The New York Times</i> published in December 2009 revealed safety concerns about the process as well as consumer complaints about the taste and smell of beef treated at optimal levels of ammonia. The following week, the newspaper published an editorial, "More Perils of Ground Meat", reiterating the concerns posed in the news article. Several days later, the editorial was appended with a retraction, stating it had incorrectly claimed there had been two recalls of ground meat because of this process, and "No meat produced by Beef Products Inc. has been linked to any illnesses or outbreaks."</p>

       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Refrigeration_.E2.80.93_R717">Refrigeration &ndash; R717</span></h4>
       <p>Because of ammonia's vaporization properties, it is a useful <!--del_lnk--> refrigerant. It was commonly used prior to the popularisation of <!--del_lnk--> chlorofluorocarbons (Freons). Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its high <!--del_lnk--> energy efficiency and low cost. However, it suffers from the disadvantages of toxicity, which restrict its domestic and small scale use. Along with its use in modern <!--del_lnk--> vapor-compression refrigeration it was used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in <!--del_lnk--> absorption refrigerators. The <!--del_lnk--> Kalina cycle, which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants, depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia-water mixture.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Ammonia was used during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> to power buses in Belgium, and in engine and solar energy applications prior to 1900. Liquid ammonia also fuelled the <!--del_lnk--> Reaction Motors XLR99 rocket engine, that powered the <!--del_lnk--> X-15 hypersonic research aircraft. Although not as powerful as other fuels, it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidizer, liquid oxygen, which simplified the aircraft's design.</p>
       <p>Ammonia has been proposed as a practical alternative to <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> for <!--del_lnk--> internal combustion engines. The calorific value of ammonia is 22.5 MJ/kg (9690 <!--del_lnk--> BTU/lb), which is about half that of diesel. In a normal engine, in which the water vapour is not condensed, the calorific value of ammonia will be about 21% less than this figure. It can be used in existing engines with only minor modifications to <!--del_lnk--> carburettors/<!--del_lnk--> injectors.</p>
       <p>To meet these demands, significant capital would be required to increase present production levels. Although the second most produced chemical, the scale of ammonia production is a small fraction of world petroleum usage. It could be manufactured from renewable energy sources, as well as coal or nuclear power. It is, however, significantly less efficient than batteries. The 60 MW Rjukan dam in <!--del_lnk--> Telemark, Norway produced ammonia via electrolysis of water for many years from 1913 producing fertilizer for much of Europe. If produced from coal, the CO<sub>2</sub> can be readily sequestered (the combustion products are nitrogen and water). In 1981 a Canadian company converted a 1981 Chevrolet Impala to operate using ammonia as fuel.</p>
       <p>Ammonia engines or ammonia motors, using ammonia as a <!--del_lnk--> working fluid, have been proposed and occasionally used. The principle is similar to that used in a <!--del_lnk--> fireless locomotive, but with ammonia as the working fluid, instead of steam or compressed air. Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by <!--del_lnk--> Goldsworthy Gurney in the UK and in <!--del_lnk--> streetcars in New Orleans.</p>

       <p>Ammonia has found significant use in various sports &ndash; particularly the strength sports of <!--del_lnk--> weightlifting and <!--del_lnk--> Olympic weightlifting as a respiratory stimulant. Ammonia is commonly used in the illegal manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> methamphetamine through a <!--del_lnk--> Birch reduction, the Birch method of making methamphetamine is dangerous because the alkali metal and liquid ammonia are both extremely reactive, and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added.</p>

       <p>Liquid ammonia is used for treatment of cotton materials, give a properties like <!--del_lnk--> mercerisation using alkalis. In particular, it is used for prewashing of wool.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lifting_gas">Lifting gas</span></h4>
       <p>At standard temperature and pressure, ammonia is less dense than atmosphere, and has approximately 60% of the lifting power of hydrogen or helium. Ammonia has sometimes been used to fill weather balloons as a <!--del_lnk--> lifting gas. Because of its relatively high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an <a href="../../wp/a/Airship.htm" title="Airship">airship</a> to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).</p>

       <p>The U. S. <!--del_lnk--> Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a 15-minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of 35 ppm by volume in the environmental air and an 8-hour exposure limit of 25 ppm by volume. NIOSH recently reduced the IDLH from 500 to 300 based on recent more conservative interpretations of original research in 1943. IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) is the level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes without suffering irreversible health effects. Other organizations have varying exposure levels. U.S. Navy Standards [U.S. Bureau of Ships 1962] maximum allowable concentrations (MACs):continuous exposure (60 days): 25 ppm / 1 hour: 400 ppm Ammonia vapour has a sharp, irritating, pungent odour that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure. The average odour threshold is 5 ppm, well below any danger or damage. Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death. Although ammonia is regulated in the United States as a non-flammable gas, it still meets the definition of a material that is toxic by inhalation and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than 13,248 L (3,500 gallons).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Toxicity">Toxicity</span></h3>
       <p>The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals, as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is converted to <!--del_lnk--> carbamoyl phosphate by the enzyme <!--del_lnk--> carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, and then enters the <!--del_lnk--> urea cycle to be either incorporated into <a href="../../wp/a/Amino_acid.htm" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a> or excreted in the urine. However, <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a> and <!--del_lnk--> amphibians lack this mechanism, as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion. Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals, and for this reason it is <!--del_lnk--> classified as <i>dangerous for the environment</i>.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Storage_information">Storage information</span></h3>
       <p>Similar to <a href="../../wp/p/Propane.htm" title="Propane">propane</a>, <!--del_lnk--> anhydrous ammonia boils below room temperature. A storage vessel capable of 250 p.s.i. is suitable to contain the liquid. Ammonium compounds should never be allowed to come in contact with <!--del_lnk--> bases (unless in an intended and contained reaction), as dangerous quantities of ammonia gas could be released.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Household_use">Household use</span></h3>
       <p>Solutions of ammonia (5&ndash;10% by weight) are used as household cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and <!--del_lnk--> mucous membranes (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin. Caution should be used that the chemical is never mixed into any liquid containing bleach, or a poisonous gas may result. Mixing with <a href="../../wp/c/Chlorine.htm" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a>-containing products or strong oxidants, such as household <!--del_lnk--> bleach, can lead to hazardous compounds such as <!--del_lnk--> chloramines.</p>

       <p>Anhydrous ammonia is classified as toxic (<b>T</b>) and dangerous for the environment (<b>N</b>). The gas is flammable (<!--del_lnk--> autoignition temperature: 651&nbsp;&deg;C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16&ndash;25%). The <!--del_lnk--> permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the United States is 50&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ppm (35&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>), while the <!--del_lnk--> IDLH concentration is estimated at 300&nbsp;ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50&nbsp;ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100&nbsp;ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper (element)">copper</a>- and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/z/Zinc.htm" title="Zinc (element)">zinc</a>-containing <!--del_lnk--> alloys, and so <!--del_lnk--> brass fittings should not be used for handling the gas.

       <p>Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of <!--del_lnk--> chemical plants worldwide produce ammonia. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, <!--del_lnk--> ammonia production is a significant component of the world energy budget. Market research reports total ammonia production in 2012 is 198 million tonnes and is predicted to increase by about 35 million tonnes by 2019. <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> produced 28.4% of the worldwide production (increasingly from coal as part of <a href="../../wp/u/Urea.htm" title="Urea">urea</a> synthesis) followed by <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> with 8.6%, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> with 8.4%, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> with 8.2%. About 80% or more of the ammonia produced is used for fertilizing agricultural crops.</p>
       <p>Before the start of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, most ammonia was obtained by the <!--del_lnk--> dry distillation of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products, including <a href="../../wp/c/Camel.htm" title="Camel">camel</a> <!--del_lnk--> dung, where it was <a href="../../wp/d/Distillation.htm" title="Distillation">distilled</a> by the reduction of <!--del_lnk--> nitrous acid and <!--del_lnk--> nitrites with hydrogen; in addition, it was produced by the distillation of <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>, and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by <!--del_lnk--> alkaline hydroxides such as <!--del_lnk--> quicklime, the salt most generally used being the chloride (<!--del_lnk--> sal-ammoniac) thus:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>2 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 2 CaO &rarr; CaCl<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + 2 NH<sub>3</sub></dd>
       </dl>
       <p>Hydrogen for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically by using the <!--del_lnk--> water gas reaction followed by the <!--del_lnk--> water gas shift reaction, produced by passing steam through red-hot <!--del_lnk--> coke, to give a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases, followed by removal of the carbon dioxide "washing" the gas mixture with water under pressure (25 <!--del_lnk--> standard atmospheres (2,500&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kPa)); or by using other sources like coal or coke gasification.</p>
       <p>Modern ammonia-producing plants depend on industrial <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen production to react with atmospheric nitrogen using a <!--del_lnk--> magnetite <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Catalysis.htm" title="Catalyst">catalyst</a> or over a promoted Fe catalyst under high pressure (100 standard atmospheres (10,000&nbsp;kPa)) and temperature (450&nbsp;&deg;C) to form anhydrous liquid ammonia. This step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop (also referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Haber&ndash;Bosch process):</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>3 H<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2 NH<sub>3</sub></dd>
       </dl>
       <p>Hydrogen required for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically using other sources like coal or coke gasification or less economically from the electrolysis of water into oxygen + hydrogen and other alternatives that are presently impractical for large scale. At one time, most of Europe's ammonia was produced from the Hydro plant at <!--del_lnk--> Vemork, via the electrolysis route. Various renewable energy electricity sources are also potentially applicable.</p>

       <p>Liquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied nonaqueous ionising solvent. Its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conductive solutions containing <!--del_lnk--> solvated electrons. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH<sub>3</sub> with those of water shows NH<sub>3</sub> has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, <!--del_lnk--> viscosity, <!--del_lnk--> dielectric constant and <!--del_lnk--> electrical conductivity; this is due at least in part to the weaker H bonding in NH<sub>3</sub> and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks, since each NH<sub>3</sub> molecule has only one lone-pair of electrons compared with two for each H<sub>2</sub>O molecule. The ionic self-<!--del_lnk--> dissociation constant of liquid NH<sub>3</sub> at &minus;50&nbsp;&deg;C is about 10<sup>&minus;33</sup> mol<sup>2</sup>&middot;l<sup>&minus;2</sup>.</p>

       <p>Ammonia is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds (more than 75%), few living creatures are capable of using this nitrogen. Nitrogen is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a>. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing <!--del_lnk--> legumes, benefit from <!--del_lnk--> symbiotic relationships with <!--del_lnk--> rhizobia that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biosynthesis">Biosynthesis</span></h3>
       <p>In certain organisms, ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen by <!--del_lnk--> enzymes called <!--del_lnk--> nitrogenases. The overall process is called <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen_fixation.htm" title="Nitrogen fixation">nitrogen fixation</a>. Although it is unlikely that biomimetic methods that are competitive with the <!--del_lnk--> Haber process will be developed, intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation. The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe<sub>7</sub>MoS<sub>9</sub> ensemble.</p>
       <p>Ammonia is also a metabolic product of <a href="../../wp/a/Amino_acid.htm" title="Amino acid">amino acid</a> <!--del_lnk--> deamination catalyzed by enzymes such as <!--del_lnk--> glutamate dehydrogenase 1. Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals. In humans, it is quickly converted to <a href="../../wp/u/Urea.htm" title="Urea">urea</a>, which is much less toxic, particularly less <a href="#Basicity">basic</a>. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of <!--del_lnk--> urine. Most reptiles, birds, insects, and snails excrete <!--del_lnk--> uric acid solely as nitrogenous waste.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_physiology">In physiology</span></h3>
       <p>Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal <!--del_lnk--> physiology. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The <!--del_lnk--> liver converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the <!--del_lnk--> urea cycle. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in <!--del_lnk--> cirrhosis, may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood (<!--del_lnk--> hyperammonemia). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as <!--del_lnk--> ornithine transcarbamylase, lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and <!--del_lnk--> coma of <!--del_lnk--> hepatic encephalopathy, as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and <!--del_lnk--> organic acidurias.</p>
       <p>Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from <!--del_lnk--> glutamine, <!--del_lnk--> &alpha;-ketoglutarate may be degraded to produce two molecules of <!--del_lnk--> bicarbonate, which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Excretion">Excretion</span></h3>
       <p>Ammonium ions are a <!--del_lnk--> toxic waste product of the <!--del_lnk--> metabolism in <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a>. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the <!--del_lnk--> urea cycle to <a href="../../wp/u/Urea.htm" title="Urea">urea</a>, because it is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into <!--del_lnk--> uric acid, which is solid, and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss.</p>

       <p>Ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in 1968, based on <!--del_lnk--> microwave emissions from the direction of the <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">galactic core</a>. This was the first <!--del_lnk--> polyatomic molecule to be so detected. The sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of <!--del_lnk--> molecular clouds. The relative intensity of the ammonia lines can be used to measure the temperature of the emitting medium.</p>
       <p>The following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected:</p>

        <dd>NH<sub>3</sub>, <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>2</sub><!--del_lnk--> D, NHD<sub>2</sub>, and ND<sub>3</sub></dd>
       </dl>
       <p>The detection of triply <!--del_lnk--> deuterated ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce. It is thought that the low-temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate.</p>
       <p>Since its interstellar discovery, NH<sub>3</sub> has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium.

       <p>The interstellar abundance for ammonia has been measured for a variety of environments. The [NH<sub>3</sub>]/[H<sub>2</sub>] ratio has been estimated to range from 10<sup>&minus;7</sup> in small dark clouds up to 10<sup>&minus;5</sup> in the dense core of the <!--del_lnk--> Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. Although a total of 18 total production routes have been proposed, the principal formation mechanism for interstellar NH<sub>3</sub> is the reaction:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + e<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr; NH<sub>3</sub> + H&middot;</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>The rate constant, <i>k</i>, of this reaction depends on the temperature of the environment, with a value of 5.2&times;10<sup>&minus;6</sup> at 10 K. The rate constant was calculated from the formula <i>k = a(T/300)<sup>B</sup></i>. For the primary formation reaction, <i>a</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.05&times;10<sup>&minus;6</sup> and <i>B</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;0.47. Assuming an NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> abundance of 3&times;10<sup>&minus;7</sup> and an electron abundance of 10<sup>&minus;7</sup> typical of molecular clouds, the formation will proceed at a rate of 1.6&times;10<sup>&minus;9</sup> cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>s<sup>&minus;1</sup> in a molecular cloud of total density 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>.</p>
       <p>All other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between 2 and 13 orders of magnitude smaller, making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant. As an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play, the reaction:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>H<sub>2</sub> + NH<sub>2</sub> &rarr; NH<sub>3</sub> + H</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>has a rate constant of 2.2&times;10<sup>&minus;15</sup>. Assuming H<sub>2</sub> densities of 10<sup>5</sup> and NH<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> ratio of 10<sup>&minus;7</sup>, this reaction proceeds at a rate of 2.2&times;10<sup>&minus;12</sup>, more than 3 orders of magnitude slower that the primary reaction above.</p>
       <p>Some of the other possible formation reactions are:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>H<sup>&minus;</sup> + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> &rarr; NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub></dd>
        <dd>PNH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> + e<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr; P + NH<sub>3</sub></dd>
       </dl>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Interstellar_destruction_mechanisms">Interstellar destruction mechanisms</span></h4>
       <p>There are 113 total proposed reactions leading to the destruction of NH<sub>3</sub>. Of these, 39 were tabulated in extensive tables of the chemistry among C, N, and O compounds. A review of interstellar ammonia cites the following reactions as the principal dissociation mechanisms:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>(1) NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> &rarr; NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub></dd>
        <dd>(2) NH<sub>3</sub> + HCO<sup>+</sup> &rarr; NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + CO</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>with rate constants of 4.39&times;10<sup>&minus;9</sup> and 2.2&times;10<sup>&minus;9</sup>, respectively. The above equations (1,2) run at a rate of 8.8&times;10<sup>&minus;9</sup> and 4.4&times;10<sup>&minus;13</sup>, respectively. These calculations assumed the given rate constants and abundances of [NH<sub>3</sub>]/[H<sub>2</sub>] = 10<sup>&minus;5</sup>, [H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>]/[H<sub>2</sub>] = 2&times;10<sup>&minus;5</sup>, [HCO<sup>+</sup>]/[H<sub>2</sub>] = 2&times;10<sup>&minus;9</sup>, and total densities of n = 10<sup>5</sup>, typical of cold, dense, molecular clouds. Clearly, between these two primary reactions, equation (1) is the dominant destruction reaction, with a rate ~10,000 times faster than equation (2). This is due to the relatively high abundance of H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>.</p>

A comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds.</p>
       <p>Microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including W3(OH), <!--del_lnk--> Orion A, W43, W51, and five sources in the galactic centre. The high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high-density regions are common in the galaxy.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Interferometric_studies">Interferometric studies</span></h4>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> VLA observations of NH<sub>3</sub> in seven regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than 0.1 <!--del_lnk--> pc in L1551, S140, and <!--del_lnk--> Cepheus A. Three individual condensations were detected in Cepheus A, one of them with a highly elongated shape. They may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region.</p>
       <p>Extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the VLA in <!--del_lnk--> IC 342. The hot gas has temperatures above 70 K, which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in CO. NH<sub>3</sub> was also monitored by VLA toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact HII regions: G9.62+0.19, G10.47+0.03, G29.96&minus;0.02, and G31.41+0.31. Based upon temperature and density diagnostics, it is concluded that in general such clumps are likely to be the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact HII region.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Infrared_detections">Infrared detections</span></h4>
       <p>Absorption at 2.97 micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the <!--del_lnk--> Becklin-Neugebauer Object and probably in NGC 2264-IR as well. This detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines.</p>
       <p>A spectrum of the disk of Jupiter was obtained from the <!--del_lnk--> Kuiper Airborne Observatory, covering the 100 to 300&nbsp;cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> spectral range. Analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze.</p>
       <p>A total of 149 dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of 'dense cores' by using the (J,K) = (1,1) rotating inversion line of NH<sub>3</sub>. In general, the cores are not spherically shaped, with aspect ratios ranging from 1.1 to 4.4. It is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars.</p>
       <p>Ammonia has been detected in the <!--del_lnk--> Draco Nebula and in one or possibly two molecular clouds, which are associated with the high-latitude galactic <!--del_lnk--> infrared cirrus. The finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the Population I metallicity B-type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Observations_of_nearby_dark_clouds">Observations of nearby dark clouds</span></h4>
       <p>By balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission, it is possible to construct a relation between <!--del_lnk--> excitation temperature and density. Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to dark clouds, regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines&mdash;indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of ~10 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> in dark clouds. Mapping of NH<sub>3</sub> gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 <!--del_lnk--> pc and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="UC_HII_regions">UC HII regions</span></h4>
       <p>Ultra-compact HII regions are among the best tracers of high-mass star formation. The dense material surrounding UCHII regions is likely primarily molecular. Since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed, ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material. Since this molecular material can be spatially resolved, it is possible to constrain the heating/ionising sources, temperatures, masses, and sizes of the regions. Doppler-shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Extragalactic_detection">Extragalactic detection</span></h4>
       <p>Ammonia has been detected in external galaxies, and by simultaneously measuring several lines, it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies. Line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm (~50 K), originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc. This picture is consistent with the picture within our <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy&mdash;hot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc (giant molecular clouds; GMCs).</p>
