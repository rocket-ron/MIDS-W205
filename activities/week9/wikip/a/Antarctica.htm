It is situated in the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic region of the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Ocean.htm" title="Southern Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>. At 14.0 million&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (5.4 million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), it is the fifth-largest continent in area after <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a> that averages at least 1 mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in thickness.</p>
       <p>Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average <!--del_lnk--> elevation of all the continents. Antarctica is considered a <a href="../../wp/d/Desert.htm" title="Desert">desert</a>, with annual <!--del_lnk--> precipitation of only 200&nbsp;mm (8&nbsp;inches) along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached &minus;89 &deg;C (&minus;129 &deg;F). There are no permanent human residents, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Only cold-adapted organisms survive there, including many types of <a href="../../wp/a/Algae.htm" title="Algae">algae</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a> (for example <!--del_lnk--> mites, <a href="../../wp/n/Nematode.htm" title="Nematode">nematodes</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Penguin.htm" title="Penguin">penguins</a>, <!--del_lnk--> seals and <!--del_lnk--> tardigrades), <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungi</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> protista. Vegetation where it occurs is <a href="../../wp/t/Tundra.htm" title="Tundra">tundra</a>.</p>
       <p>Although myths and speculation about a <i><!--del_lnk--> Terra Australis</i> ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, the first confirmed sighting of the continent is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the <!--del_lnk--> Russian expedition of <!--del_lnk--> Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Lazarev on <i><!--del_lnk--> Vostok</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Mirny</i>. The continent, however, remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of resources, and isolation. The <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctic_Treaty_System.htm" title="Antarctic Treaty System">Antarctic Treaty</a> was signed in 1959 by 12 countries; to date, 49 countries have signed the treaty. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's <!--del_lnk--> ecozone. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>The name <i>Antarctica</i> is the <!--del_lnk--> romanized version of the <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a> compound word <i>&#x1F00;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x3AE;</i> (<i>antarktik&eacute;</i>), feminine of <i>&#x1F00;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x3CC;&sigmaf;</i> (<i>antarktikos</i>), meaning "opposite to the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a>", "opposite to the north".</p>
       <p>Before getting its present geographical connotations, the term was used for other locations which could be defined as "opposite to the north". For example, the short-lived French colony established at <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> in the 16th Century was called "<!--del_lnk--> France Antarctique".</p>
       <p>The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish <!--del_lnk--> cartographer <!--del_lnk--> John George Bartholomew.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_exploration">History of exploration</span></h2>
       <p>Belief in the existence of a <i>Terra Australis</i> &ndash; a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of Europe, Asia and <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> &ndash; has existed since the times of <a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> (1st century AD), who suggested the idea to preserve the <a href="../../wp/s/Symmetry.htm" title="Symmetry">symmetry</a> of all known <!--del_lnk--> landmasses in the world. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.</p>
       <p>A key part of the story of how Antarctica got its name is how it did <i>not</i> get named <i>Terra Australis</i>. <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> got named after this instead, and it was because of the mistake made by people who had decided that no significant land mass further south of Australia would be found. Explorer <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Flinders, in particular, has been credited with popularizing the transfer of the name <i>Terra Australis</i> to Australia. He justified the titling of his book <i><!--del_lnk--> A Voyage to Terra Australis</i> (1814) by writing in the introduction:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country, and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>(For more info about how Australia got named after <i>Terra Australis</i> instead of Antarctica, see <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm#Etymology" title="Australia">Australia#Etymology</a>.)</p>
       <p>European maps continued to show this hypothesized land until Captain <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a>'s ships, <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Resolution</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Adventure</i>, crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773 and again in January 1774. Cook came within about 75 miles (121&nbsp;km) of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773. The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals. According to various organizations (the <!--del_lnk--> National Science Foundation, <a href="../../wp/n/NASA.htm" title="NASA">NASA</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> University of California, San Diego, and other sources), ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica in 1820: <!--del_lnk--> Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen (a <!--del_lnk--> Baltic German captain in the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Russian Navy), <!--del_lnk--> Edward Bransfield (an <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Irish</a>-born captain in the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>), and <!--del_lnk--> Nathaniel Palmer (an American <!--del_lnk--> sealer out of <!--del_lnk--> Stonington, Connecticut). Von Bellingshausen saw Antarctica on 27 January 1820, three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820. On that day the expedition led by Von Bellingshausen and <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Lazarev on ships <i><!--del_lnk--> Vostok</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Mirny</i> reached a point within 32&nbsp;km (20&nbsp;mi) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice fields there. The first documented landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer <!--del_lnk--> John Davis in <!--del_lnk--> West Antarctica on 7 February 1821, although some historians dispute this claim.</p>
       <p>On 22 January 1840, two days after the discovery of the coast west of the <!--del_lnk--> Balleny Islands, some members of the crew of the 1837-40 expedition of <!--del_lnk--> Jules Dumont d'Urville disembarked on the highest islet of a <!--del_lnk--> group of rocky islands about 4&nbsp;km from <!--del_lnk--> Cape Geodesie on the coast of <!--del_lnk--> Ad&eacute;lie land where they took some mineral, algae and animal samples.</p>
       <p>In December 1839, as part of the <!--del_lnk--> United States Exploring Expedition of 1838&ndash;42 conducted by the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy (sometimes called the "Ex. Ex.", or "the Wilkes Expedition"), an expedition sailed from Sydney, Australia, into the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Southern_Ocean.htm" title="Antarctic Ocean">Antarctic Ocean</a>, as it was then known, and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the <!--del_lnk--> Balleny Islands" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was later named "<!--del_lnk--> Wilkes Land", a name it maintains to this day.</p>

       <p>Explorer <!--del_lnk--> James Clark Ross passed through what is now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Ross Sea and discovered <!--del_lnk--> Ross Island (both of which were named for him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the <!--del_lnk--> Ross Ice Shelf. <!--del_lnk--> Mount Erebus and <!--del_lnk--> Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition: <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Erebus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Terror</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Mercator Cooper landed in <!--del_lnk--> East Antarctica on 26 January 1853.</p>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Nimrod Expedition led by <a href="../../wp/e/Ernest_Shackleton.htm" title="Ernest Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a> in 1907, parties led by <!--del_lnk--> Edgeworth David became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the <!--del_lnk--> South Magnetic Pole. <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Mawson, who assumed the leadership of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 &ndash; February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the <!--del_lnk--> Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountain Range (via the <!--del_lnk--> Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An <!--del_lnk--> expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship <i><!--del_lnk--> Fram</i> became the first to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Whales and up the <!--del_lnk--> Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed <!--del_lnk--> Scott Expedition reached the pole.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Richard E. Byrd led several voyages to the Antarctic by plane in the 1930s and 1940s. He is credited with implementing mechanized land <!--del_lnk--> transport on the continent and conducting extensive geological and biological research. However, it was not until 31 October 1956 that anyone set foot on the South Pole again; on that day a U.S. Navy group led by Rear Admiral <!--del_lnk--> George J. Dufek successfully landed an aircraft there.</p>
       <p>The first person to sail single-handed to Antarctica was the <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealander</a> <!--del_lnk--> David Henry Lewis, in 1972, in a 10-meter steel sloop <i>Ice Bird</i>.<br style="clear:both;" />

       <p>Antarctica is divided in two by the <!--del_lnk--> Transantarctic Mountains close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the <!--del_lnk--> Weddell Sea. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the <!--del_lnk--> Greenwich meridian.</p>

       <p>About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic ice sheet, a <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_sheet.htm" title="Ice sheet">sheet of ice</a> averaging at least 1.6&nbsp;km (1.0&nbsp;mi) thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's <!--del_lnk--> fresh water). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about 60&nbsp;m (200&nbsp;ft). In most of the interior of the continent, <!--del_lnk--> precipitation is very low, down to 20&nbsp;mm (0.8&nbsp;in) per year; in a few "<!--del_lnk--> blue ice" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by <!--del_lnk--> sublimation and so the local mass balance is negative. In the <!--del_lnk--> dry valleys the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> West Antarctica is covered by the <!--del_lnk--> West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Current_sea_level_rise.htm" title="Sea level change">ocean levels</a> would rise by several metres in a relatively <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Geologic_time_scale.htm" title="Geological timescale">geologically short</a> period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic <!--del_lnk--> ice streams, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, <!--del_lnk--> flow to one of the many <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic ice shelves.</p>
       <p>East Antarctica lies on the Indian Ocean side of the <!--del_lnk--> Transantarctic Mountains and comprises <!--del_lnk--> Coats Land, <!--del_lnk--> Queen Maud Land, <!--del_lnk--> Enderby Land, <!--del_lnk--> Mac. Robertson Land, <!--del_lnk--> Wilkes Land and <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Land. All but a small portion of this region lies within the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Hemisphere.

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&nbsp;m (16,050&nbsp;ft), is located in the <!--del_lnk--> Ellsworth Mountains. Antarctica contains <!--del_lnk--> many other mountains, both on the main continent and the surrounding islands. Located on <!--del_lnk--> Ross Island, Mount Erebus is the world's southernmost active volcano. Another well-known volcano is found on <!--del_lnk--> Deception Island, which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active. In 2004, an underwater volcano was found in the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Peninsula by American and Canadian researchers. Recent evidence shows this unnamed volcano may be active.</p>
       <p>Antarctica is home to more than 70 lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet. <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Vostok.htm" title="Lake Vostok">Lake Vostok</a>, discovered beneath Russia's <!--del_lnk--> Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these <!--del_lnk--> subglacial lakes. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.</p>
       <p>There is some evidence, in the form of <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_core.htm" title="Ice core">ice cores</a> drilled to about 400&nbsp;m (1,300&nbsp;ft) above the water line, that Lake Vostok's waters may contain <!--del_lnk--> microbial life. The frozen surface of the lake shares similarities with <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter.htm" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s moon <!--del_lnk--> Europa. If life is discovered in Lake Vostok, this would strengthen the argument for the possibility of life on Europa. On 7 February 2008, a NASA team embarked on a mission to <!--del_lnk--> Lake Untersee, searching for <!--del_lnk--> extremophiles in its highly alkaline waters. If found, these resilient creatures could further bolster the argument for extraterrestrial life in extremely cold, methane-rich environments.</p>

       <p>More than 170&nbsp;million years ago, Antarctica was part of the <a href="../../wp/s/Supercontinent.htm" title="Supercontinent">supercontinent</a> <a href="../../wp/g/Gondwana.htm" title="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>. Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25&nbsp;million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life-forms.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Paleozoic_era_.28540.E2.80.93250_Ma.29">Paleozoic era (540&ndash;250 Ma)</span></h4>
       <p>During the <a href="../../wp/c/Cambrian.htm" title="Cambrian">Cambrian period</a>, Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Hemisphere, and during this period large amounts of <!--del_lnk--> sandstones, <!--del_lnk--> limestones and <!--del_lnk--> shales were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor <a href="../../wp/i/Invertebrate.htm" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> and <!--del_lnk--> trilobites flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the <a href="../../wp/d/Devonian.htm" title="Devonian">Devonian period</a> (416&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">Sand</a> and <!--del_lnk--> silts were laid down in what is now the <!--del_lnk--> Ellsworth, <!--del_lnk--> Horlick and <!--del_lnk--> Pensacola Mountains. <!--del_lnk--> Glaciation began at the end of the Devonian period (360&nbsp;Ma), as Gondwana became centered around the South Pole and the climate cooled, though <!--del_lnk--> flora remained. During the <a href="../../wp/p/Permian.htm" title="Permian">Permian</a> period, the plant life became dominated by <a href="../../wp/f/Fern.htm" title="Fern">fern</a>-like plants such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Glossopteris</i>, which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the <!--del_lnk--> Transantarctic Mountains. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mesozoic_era_.28250.E2.80.9365_Ma.29">Mesozoic era (250&ndash;65 Ma)</span></h4>
       <p>As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, the <!--del_lnk--> seed fern became established, and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. <!--del_lnk--> Synapsids, commonly known as "mammal-like reptiles", were common in Antarctica during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Permian.htm" title="Late Permian">Late Permian</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Early Triassic and included forms such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Lystrosaurus</i>. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the <a href="../../wp/j/Jurassic.htm" title="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> period (206&ndash;146&nbsp;Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. <!--del_lnk--> Ginkgo trees and <!--del_lnk--> cycads were plentiful during this period. In West Antarctica, <!--del_lnk--> coniferous <a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">forests</a> dominated through the entire <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period (146&ndash;65&nbsp;Ma), though <!--del_lnk--> Southern beech began to take over at the end of this period. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Ammonoidea.htm" title="Ammonite">Ammonites</a> were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only three Antarctic dinosaur <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Genus.htm" title="Genera">genera</a> (<i><!--del_lnk--> Cryolophosaurus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Glacialisaurus</i>, from the <!--del_lnk--> Hanson Formation, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Antarctopelta</i>) have been described to date. It was during this period that Gondwana began to break up.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Gondwanaland_breakup_.28160.E2.80.9323_Ma.29">Gondwanaland breakup (160&ndash;23 Ma)</span></h4>
       <p>The cooling of Antarctica occurred stepwise, as the continental spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalizing currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.</p>
       <p>Africa separated from Antarctica around 160&nbsp;Ma, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent, in the early Cretaceous (about 125&nbsp;Ma). About 65&nbsp;Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a <!--del_lnk--> marsupial <!--del_lnk--> fauna. About 40&nbsp;Ma Australia-<!--del_lnk--> New Guinea separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear. During the <!--del_lnk--> Eocene&ndash;Oligocene extinction event about 34&nbsp;million years ago, CO<sub>2</sub> levels have been found to be about 760 ppm and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm.</p>
       <p>Around 23 Ma, the <!--del_lnk--> Drake Passage opened between Antarctica and South America, resulting in the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Circumpolar Current that completely isolated the continent. Models of the changes suggest that declining CO<sub>2</sub> levels became more important. The ice began to spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Neogene_Period_.2823.E2.80.930.05_mya.29">Neogene Period (23&ndash;0.05 mya)</span></h4>
       <p>Since about 15 Ma, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.</p>
       <p>Intermittent warm periods allowed <!--del_lnk--> Nothofagus shrubs to cling to the Sirius group in the Dominion Range as late as 3-4 Ma. After that the Pleistocene ice-age covered the whole continent and destroyed all major plant life on it.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Geology_of_present-day_Antarctica">Geology of present-day Antarctica</span></h3>
       <p>The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by the fact that nearly all of the continent is permanently covered with a thick layer of ice. However, new techniques such as <!--del_lnk--> remote sensing, <!--del_lnk--> ground-penetrating radar and <!--del_lnk--> satellite imagery have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.</p>
       <p>Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> mountain range of South America. The <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Peninsula was formed by uplift and <!--del_lnk--> metamorphism of sea bed sediments during the late <!--del_lnk--> Paleozoic and the early <!--del_lnk--> Mesozoic eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Igneous_rock.htm" title="Igneous">igneous</a> intrusions and <!--del_lnk--> volcanism. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are <a href="../../wp/a/Andesite.htm" title="Andesite">andesite</a> and <!--del_lnk--> rhyolite volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in <!--del_lnk--> Marie Byrd Land and <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Island. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the <!--del_lnk--> Ellsworth Mountains region, where the <!--del_lnk--> stratigraphy is more similar to the eastern part of the continent.</p>
       <p>East Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the <a href="../../wp/p/Precambrian.htm" title="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> era, with some rocks formed more than 3&nbsp;billion years ago. It is composed of a <a href="../../wp/m/Metamorphic_rock.htm" title="Metamorphic rock">metamorphic</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Igneous_rock.htm" title="Igneous">igneous</a> platform which is the basis of the <!--del_lnk--> continental shield. On top of this base are various modern rocks, such as <!--del_lnk--> sandstones, <!--del_lnk--> limestones, coal and <!--del_lnk--> shales laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the <!--del_lnk--> Transantarctic Mountains. In coastal areas such as <!--del_lnk--> Shackleton Range and <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Land some <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fault_%2528geology%2529.htm" title="Geologic fault">faulting</a> has occurred.</p>
       <p>The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal. It was first recorded near the <!--del_lnk--> Beardmore Glacier by <!--del_lnk--> Frank Wild on the <!--del_lnk--> Nimrod Expedition, and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The <!--del_lnk--> Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the <!--del_lnk--> oil and <!--del_lnk--> natural gas fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is <!--del_lnk--> banned until 2048 by the <!--del_lnk--> Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h2>
       <p>Antarctica is the coldest of <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s continents.

       <p>East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. <!--del_lnk--> Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended time periods. Heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48&nbsp;in) in 48 hours have been recorded.</p>
       <p>At the edge of the continent, strong <!--del_lnk--> katabatic winds off the <!--del_lnk--> polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are typically moderate. During summer, more <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sunlight.htm" title="Solar radiation">solar radiation</a> reaches the surface during clear days at the South Pole than at the <a href="../../wp/e/Equator.htm" title="Equator">equator</a> because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.</p>
       <p>Antarctica is colder than the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than 3 kilometres (2&nbsp;mi) above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the <!--del_lnk--> troposphere. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world. Third, the Earth is at <!--del_lnk--> aphelion in July (i.e., the Earth is furthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at <!--del_lnk--> perihelion in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> aurora australis, commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full <!--del_lnk--> solar winds that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is <!--del_lnk--> diamond dust, a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A <!--del_lnk--> sun dog, a frequent atmospheric <!--del_lnk--> optical phenomenon, is a bright "spot" beside the true <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a>.</p>

       <p>A number of governments maintain permanent manned <!--del_lnk--> research stations throughout the continent. The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Orthodox church">Orthodox church</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Trinity Church, opened in 2004 at the Russian <!--del_lnk--> Bellingshausen Station is also manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.</p>
       <p>The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Convergence) were British and American <!--del_lnk--> sealers who used to spend a year or more on <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands.htm" title="South Georgia Island">South Georgia</a>, from 1786 onward. During the <!--del_lnk--> whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included <!--del_lnk--> Grytviken, <!--del_lnk--> Leith Harbour, <!--del_lnk--> King Edward Point, <!--del_lnk--> Stromness, <!--del_lnk--> Husvik, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Olav Harbour, <!--del_lnk--> Ocean Harbour and <!--del_lnk--> Godthul. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain <!--del_lnk--> Carl Anton Larsen, a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.</p>
       <p>The first child born in the <!--del_lnk--> southern polar region was Norwegian girl <!--del_lnk--> Solveig Gunbj&oslash;rg Jacobsen, born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands.htm" title="South Georgia">South Georgia</a>. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and of Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 and became the manager of Grytviken, serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Emilio Marcos Palma was the first person born south of the <!--del_lnk--> 60th parallel south (the continental limit according to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Antarctic_Treaty_System.htm" title="Antarctic Treaty">Antarctic Treaty</a>), as well as the first one born on the Antarctic mainland, in 1978 at <!--del_lnk--> Base Esperanza, on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentine</a> government to determine if family life was suitable on the continent. In 1984, Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the <!--del_lnk--> Frei Montalva Station, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station. In 2009, eleven children were born in Antarctica (south of the 60th parallel south): eight at the Argentinean <!--del_lnk--> Esperanza Base and three at the Chilean <!--del_lnk--> Frei Montalva Station.</p>

       </div>
       <p>About 1150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are <!--del_lnk--> cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanized cells make them resistant to UV-light. Those features are observed in different Antarctic fungi which can be shown by molecular studies to belong in different taxonomic orders. They can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as <i>Cryomyces minteri</i>. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Plants">Plants</span></h3>
       <p>The climate of Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soil</a> quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very small and limited in distribution. The <!--del_lnk--> flora of the continent largely consists of <!--del_lnk--> bryophytes (there are about 100 species of <a href="../../wp/m/Moss.htm" title="Moss">mosses</a> and 25 species of <!--del_lnk--> liverworts), with only two species of flowering plants, both found in the Antarctic Peninsula: <i><!--del_lnk--> Deschampsia antarctica</i> (Antarctic hair grass) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Colobanthus quitensis</i> (Antarctic pearlwort). Growth generally occurs in the summer, and only for a few weeks at most.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_organisms">Other organisms</span></h3>
       <p>Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are <!--del_lnk--> phytoplankton. Multicolored <!--del_lnk--> snow algae and <!--del_lnk--> diatoms are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer. Recently ancient ecosystems consisting of several types of bacteria have been found living trapped deep beneath glaciers. The <!--del_lnk--> autotrophic community is made up of mostly <!--del_lnk--> protists.</p>

       <p>The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also known as the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main instrument concerned with conservation and management of biodiversity in Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.</p>
       <p>The passing of the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The <!--del_lnk--> overfishing of <a href="../../wp/k/Krill.htm" title="Krill">krill</a>, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of <!--del_lnk--> Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> tonnes (35,300&nbsp;short tons) in 2000.</p>

       <p>Antarctica has no government, although various countries claim sovereignty in certain regions. While a few of these countries have mutually recognised each other's claims, the validity of these claims is not recognised universally.</p>
       <p>New claims on Antarctica have been suspended since 1959 and the continent is considered politically neutral. Its status is regulated by the 1959 <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Antarctic_Treaty_System.htm" title="Antarctic Treaty">Antarctic Treaty</a> and other related agreements, collectively called the <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctic_Treaty_System.htm" title="Antarctic Treaty System">Antarctic Treaty System</a>. Antarctica is defined as all land and <!--del_lnk--> ice shelves south of 60&deg; S for the purposes of the Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, Australia, and the United States. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on the continent. This was the first <!--del_lnk--> arms control agreement established during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>.</p>
       <p>In 1983, the Antarctic Treaty Parties began negotiations on a convention to regulate mining in Antarctica. A coalition of international organisations launched a public pressure campaign to prevent any minerals development in the region, led largely by <!--del_lnk--> Greenpeace International which established its own scientific station&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> World Park Base&ndash;in the Ross Sea region and conducted annual expeditions to document environmental effects of humans on the continent. In 1988, the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources (CRAMRA) was adopted. The following year, however, Australia and France announced that they would not ratify the convention, rendering it dead for all intents and purposes. They proposed instead that a comprehensive regime to protect the Antarctic environment be negotiated in its place. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the 'Madrid Protocol') was negotiated as other countries followed suit and on 14 January 1998 it entered into force. The Madrid Protocol bans all mining in Antarctica, designating the continent as a 'natural reserve devoted to peace and science'.</p>

       <p>The Argentine, British, and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction.

On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, John Freeman, was summoned to the Argentine government as protest against the claim. Argentine-UK relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over the sovereignty of the nearby <a href="../../wp/f/Falkland_Islands.htm" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a>, and the 30th anniversary of the <!--del_lnk--> Falklands War.</p>
       <p>The areas shown as <!--del_lnk--> Australia's and <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand's claims were British territory until they were handed over following the countries' independence. Australia currently claims the largest area. The claims of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France and Norway are all recognised by each other.</p>

       <p>There is no economic activity in Antarctica at present, except for fishing off the coast and small-scale <!--del_lnk--> tourism, both based outside Antarctica. The <!--del_lnk--> Antarctican dollar, a souvenir item sold in the United States and Canada, is not legal tender.</p>

The 1991 <!--del_lnk--> Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000&ndash;01 reported landing 112,934&nbsp;tonnes.</p>
       <p>Small-scale "expedition tourism" has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions, but in effect self-regulated by the <!--del_lnk--> International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO). Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO, but IAATO members account for 95% of the tourist activity. Travel is largely by small or medium ship, focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife. A total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006&ndash;07 <!--del_lnk--> Austral summer with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships. The number is predicted to increase to over 80,000 by 2010.</p>
       <p>There has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors. A call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota has been made by some environmentalists and scientists. The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop, through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO, "site use guidelines" setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. Antarctic sight seeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of <!--del_lnk--> Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979 on Mount Erebus, which killed all 257 aboard. <!--del_lnk--> Qantas resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.</p>

       <p>Antarctic fisheries in 1998&ndash;1999 (July 1&nbsp;- June 30) reported landing 119,898 tonnes. Unregulated fishing landed five to six times more than the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing in Antarctic waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by France and Australia) of at least eight fishing ships.

       <p>Researchers include <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biologists</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geologists</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Oceanography.htm" title="Oceanography">oceanographers</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physicists</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomers</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Glaciology.htm" title="Glaciology">glaciologists</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Meteorology.htm" title="Meteorology">meteorologists</a>. Geologists tend to study <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a>, meteorites from <!--del_lnk--> outer space, and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent <a href="../../wp/g/Gondwana.htm" title="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and <!--del_lnk--> dynamics of floating ice, <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">seasonal snow</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glaciers</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_sheet.htm" title="Ice sheet">ice sheets</a>. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at <!--del_lnk--> Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station study the celestial dome and <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a>. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere, low temperature, which minimizes the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, and absence of <!--del_lnk--> light pollution, thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest <!--del_lnk--> neutrino telescope in the world, built 2&nbsp;km (1.2&nbsp;mi) below Amundsen-Scott station.</p>
       <p>Since the 1970s, an important focus of study has been the <!--del_lnk--> ozone layer in the <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at <!--del_lnk--> Halley Station on the <!--del_lnk--> Brunt Ice Shelf discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by <!--del_lnk--> chlorofluorocarbons emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the <!--del_lnk--> Montreal Protocol of 1989, it is believed that the ozone hole will close up by around 2065.</p>
       <p>In September 2006, <a href="../../wp/n/NASA.htm" title="NASA">NASA</a> satellite data revealed that the Antarctic <a href="../../wp/o/Ozone_depletion.htm" title="Ozone hole">ozone hole</a> was larger than at any other time on record, 27.5&nbsp;million&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (10.6&nbsp;million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).</p>
       <p>On 6 September 2007, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgian">Belgian</a>-based International Polar Foundation unveiled the <!--del_lnk--> Princess Elisabeth station, the world's first zero-emissions polar science station in Antarctica to <!--del_lnk--> research <a href="../../wp/c/Climate_change.htm" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. Costing $16.3&nbsp;million, the <!--del_lnk--> prefabricated station, which is part of <!--del_lnk--> International Polar Year, was shipped to the South Pole from <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> by the end of 2008 to monitor the <a href="../../wp/h/Health.htm" title="Health">health</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> polar regions. Belgian polar <!--del_lnk--> explorer <!--del_lnk--> Alain Hubert stated: "This base will be the first of its kind to produce zero emissions, making it a unique model of how energy should be used in the Antarctic." Johan Berte is the leader of the station design team and manager of the project which conducts research in <!--del_lnk--> climatology, <a href="../../wp/g/Glaciology.htm" title="Glaciology">glaciology</a> and <!--del_lnk--> microbiology.</p>
       <p>In January 2008, the <!--del_lnk--> British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, reported (in the journal <!--del_lnk--> Nature Geoscience) that 2,200 years ago, a <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcano</a> erupted under Antarctica's ice sheet (based on <!--del_lnk--> airborne survey with radar images). The biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the <!--del_lnk--> Hudson Mountains, close to <!--del_lnk--> Pine Island Glacier.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Meteorites from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>; most are thought to come from <a href="../../wp/a/Asteroid.htm" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a>, but some may have originated on larger <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planets</a>. The first meteorites were found in 1912. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.</p>
       <p>This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly <!--del_lnk--> ALH84001 discovered by <!--del_lnk--> ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.</p>
       <p>In 2006, a team of researchers from <!--del_lnk--> Ohio State University used gravity measurements by NASA's <!--del_lnk--> GRACE satellites to discover the 300-mile (480&nbsp;km)-wide <!--del_lnk--> Wilkes Land crater, which probably formed about 250&nbsp;million years ago.</p>
       <p>In January 2013, an 18&nbsp;kg (40&nbsp;lb) meteorite was discovered frozen in ice on the Nansen ice field by a Search for Antarctic Meteorites, Belgian Approach (SAMBA) mission.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a <a href="../../wp/d/Desert.htm" title="Desert">desert</a>) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as <!--del_lnk--> ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many <!--del_lnk--> ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from <a href="../../wp/s/Seawater.htm" title="Seawater">seawater</a> through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global warming.</p>
       <p>Sea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The <!--del_lnk--> extent of <a href="../../wp/s/Sea_ice.htm" title="Sea ice">sea ice</a> around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the thickness changes are unclear.</p>
       <p>Melting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.</p>
       <p>On the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water. This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea. West Antarctica is currently experiencing a net outflow of glacial ice, which will increase global sea level over time. A review of the scientific studies looking at data from 1992 to 2006 suggested that a net loss of around 50 <!--del_lnk--> gigatonnes of ice per year was a reasonable estimate (around 0.14&nbsp;mm of sea level rise). Significant acceleration of outflow glaciers in the <!--del_lnk--> Amundsen Sea Embayment may have more than doubled this figure for 2006.</p>
       <p>East Antarctica is a cold region with a ground base <!--del_lnk--> above sea level and occupies most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the <!--del_lnk--> East Antarctic Ice Sheet as a whole is thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.</p>

       <p>Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05&nbsp;&deg;C (0.09&nbsp;&deg;F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1&nbsp;&deg;C (0.2&nbsp;&deg;F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by fall cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">warming</a> as a result of human <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> emissions. However, the small amount of surface warming in West Antarctica is not believed to be directly affecting the <!--del_lnk--> West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the <!--del_lnk--> continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.</p>
       <p>In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's <!--del_lnk--> Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 square kilometres (220&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of ice from the <!--del_lnk--> Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (5,800&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a "thread" of ice about 6&nbsp;km (4&nbsp;mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to <a href="../../wp/n/NASA.htm" title="NASA">NASA</a>, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as <span style="white-space:nowrap;">5 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(41&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Each year a large area of low ozone concentration or "<a href="../../wp/o/Ozone_depletion.htm" title="Ozone hole">ozone hole</a>" grows over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December. The hole was detected by scientists in 1985 and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the <!--del_lnk--> emission of <!--del_lnk--> chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the <a href="../../wp/o/Ozone.htm" title="Ozone">ozone</a> into other gases.</p>
       <p>Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the <!--del_lnk--> stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6&nbsp;&deg;C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the <!--del_lnk--> polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea-ice just offshore of the continent.<br style="clear:both;" />
