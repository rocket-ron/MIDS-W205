Its principal language is Dutch. The city's status as the capital of the nation is governed by the <!--del_lnk--> constitution. Amsterdam has a population of 820,256 within city limits, an urban population of 1,209,419 and a metropolitan population of 2,289,762. The city is located in the <!--del_lnk--> province of <!--del_lnk--> North Holland in the west of the country. It comprises the northern part of the <!--del_lnk--> Randstad, one of the larger <!--del_lnk--> conurbations in Europe, with a population of approximately 7&nbsp;million.</p>
       <p>Amsterdam's name is derived from <i>Amstelredamme</i>, indicative of the city's origin: a dam in the river <!--del_lnk--> Amstel. Settled as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world during the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Golden Age, a result of its innovative developments in trade. During that time, the city was the leading centre for finance and diamonds. In the 19th and 20th centuries, <!--del_lnk--> the city expanded, and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were formed. The 17th-century <!--del_lnk--> canals of Amsterdam (in Dutch: 'Grachtengordel'), located in the heart of Amsterdam, were added to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="UNESCO World Heritage List">UNESCO World Heritage List</a> in July 2010.</p>
       <p>As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an alpha world city by the <!--del_lnk--> Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) study group. The city is also cultural capital of the Netherlands. Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters there, and 7 of the world's top 500 companies, including <!--del_lnk--> Philips and <!--del_lnk--> ING, are based in the city. In 2010, Amsterdam was ranked 13th globally on quality of living by Mercer, and previously ranked 3rd in innovation by 2thinknow in the Innovation Cities Index 2009.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the oldest stock exchange in the world, is located in the city centre. <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam's main attractions, including its <!--del_lnk--> historic canals, the <!--del_lnk--> Rijksmuseum, the <!--del_lnk--> Van Gogh Museum, <!--del_lnk--> Stedelijk Museum, <!--del_lnk--> Hermitage Amsterdam, <!--del_lnk--> Anne Frank House, <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam Museum, its <!--del_lnk--> red-light district, and its many <!--del_lnk--> cannabis coffee shops draw more than 3.66&nbsp;million international visitors annually.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The earliest recorded use of the name "Amsterdam" is from a certificate dated 27 October 1275, when the inhabitants, who had built a bridge with a dam across the <!--del_lnk--> Amstel, were exempted from paying a <!--del_lnk--> bridge toll by Count <!--del_lnk--> Floris V. The certificate describes the inhabitants as <i>homines manentes apud Amestelledamme</i> (people living near <i>Amestelledamme</i>). By 1327, the name had developed into <i>Aemsterdam</i>.</p>

       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Founding_and_Middle_Ages">Founding and Middle Ages</span></h3>
       <p>Amsterdam's founding is relatively recent compared with much older Dutch cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Nijmegen, <a href="../../wp/r/Rotterdam.htm" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/Utrecht.htm" title="Utrecht (city)">Utrecht</a>. In October 2008, <!--del_lnk--> historical geographer Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. This does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then since <!--del_lnk--> reclamation of land may not have been for farming&mdash;it may have been for <!--del_lnk--> peat, used as fuel.</p>
       <p>Amsterdam was granted <!--del_lnk--> city rights in either 1300 or 1306. From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely because of trade with the <!--del_lnk--> Hanseatic League. In 1345, an alleged <!--del_lnk--> Eucharistic miracle in the <!--del_lnk--> Kalverstraat rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage until the <!--del_lnk--> adoption of the Protestant faith. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Stille Omgang</i>&mdash;a silent <!--del_lnk--> procession in civil attire&mdash;is today a remnant of the rich pilgrimage history.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Conflict_with_Spain">Conflict with Spain</span></h3>
       <p>In the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against <a href="../../wp/p/Philip_II_of_Spain.htm" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> and his successors. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the <!--del_lnk--> religious persecution of Protestants by the <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_Inquisition.htm" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>. The revolt escalated into the <!--del_lnk--> Eighty Years' War, which ultimately led to Dutch independence. Strongly pushed by <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Revolt leader <a href="../../wp/w/William_the_Silent.htm" title="William the Silent">William the Silent</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Republic became known for its relative <!--del_lnk--> religious tolerance. <!--del_lnk--> Jews from the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian Peninsula, <!--del_lnk--> Huguenots from France, prosperous merchants and printers from <!--del_lnk--> Flanders, and economic and religious refugees from the Spanish-controlled parts of the <!--del_lnk--> Low Countries found safety in Amsterdam. The influx of Flemish printers and the city's intellectual tolerance made Amsterdam a centre for the European <!--del_lnk--> free press.</p>

       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Center_of_the_Dutch_Golden_Age">Centre of the Dutch Golden Age</span></h3>
       <p>The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's <i><!--del_lnk--> Golden Age</i>, during which it became the wealthiest city in the world. Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch East India Company and the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch West India Company. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became <!--del_lnk--> Dutch colonies. Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading <!--del_lnk--> Financial Centre of the world. In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world's first <!--del_lnk--> stock exchange by trading in its own shares.</p>

       <p>Amsterdam lost over 10% of its population to <!--del_lnk--> plague in 1623&ndash;1625, and again in 1635&ndash;1636, 1655, and 1664. Nevertheless, the population of Amsterdam rose in the 17th century (largely through immigration) from 50,000 to 200,000.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Decline_and_modernization">Decline and modernization</span></h3>
       <p>Amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The <!--del_lnk--> wars of the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Republic with <a href="../../wp/k/Kingdom_of_England.htm" title="Kingdom of England">England</a> and France took their toll on Amsterdam. During the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, Amsterdam's significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the <!--del_lnk--> French Empire. However, the later establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815 marked a turning point.</p>

       <p>The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam's second Golden Age. New museums, a train station, and the <!--del_lnk--> Concertgebouw were built; in this same time, the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> reached the city. The <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam-Rhine Canal was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the <a href="../../wp/r/Rhine.htm" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> North Sea Canal was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Conrad gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in <!--del_lnk--> <i>The Mirror of the Sea</i>.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Twentieth_century">Twentieth century</span></h3>
       <p>Shortly before the First World War, the city began expanding, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the <i>Aardappeloproer</i> (Potato rebellion). People started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies, mainly food.</p>

Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to the high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps.

       <p>Many new suburbs, such as <!--del_lnk--> Osdorp, <!--del_lnk--> Slotervaart, <i>Slotermeer</i>, and <i>Geuzenveld</i>, were built in the years after the Second World War. These suburbs contained many public parks and wide, open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. Because of the war and other incidents of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing, politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings and new roads as the automobile became available to most common people. A <!--del_lnk--> metro started operating in 1977 between the new suburb of Bijlmer and the centre of Amsterdam. Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect the <!--del_lnk--> Central Station and city centre with other parts of the city.</p>
       <p>The incorporated large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdam's formerly Jewish neighbourhood. Smaller streets, such as the <i>Jodenbreestraat</i>, were widened and saw almost all of their houses demolished. During the destruction's peak, the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Nieuwmarktrellen</i> (Nieuwmarkt riots) broke out, where people expressed their fury about the demolition caused by the restructuring of the city.</p>
       <p>As a result, the demolition was stopped, and the highway was never built, with only the metro being finished. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished <i>Waterlooplein</i>. Meanwhile, large private organisations, such as <i>Stadsherstel Amsterdam</i>, were founded with the aim of restoring the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing. The entire city centre has reattained its former splendor and, as a whole, is now a <!--del_lnk--> protected area. Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the <i>Grachtengordel</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Herengracht, <!--del_lnk--> Keizersgracht, and <!--del_lnk--> Prinsengracht) was added to the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">UNESCO World Heritage List</a>.</p>

       <p>At the beginning of the new millennium, social problems such as safety, ethnic discrimination and segregation between religious and social groups began to develop. Forty-five percent of the population of Amsterdam has non-Dutch parents. Large social groups come from Surinam, the Dutch Antilles, Morocco and Turkey. Amsterdam is characterized by its (perceived) social tolerance and diversity. The social tolerance was endangered by the murder of Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh on 2 November 2004 by a Mohamed Bouyeri, an Islamic fundamentalist. The former mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, and his alderman for integration Ahmed Aboutaleb formulated a policy of "keeping things together" which involves social dialogue, tolerance and harsh measures against those who break the law.</p>

       <p>Amsterdam is located in the western Netherlands, in the province of <!--del_lnk--> North Holland. The river <!--del_lnk--> Amstel terminates in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the <!--del_lnk--> IJ. Amsterdam is situated 2 metres <!--del_lnk--> above sea level. The surrounding land is flat as it is formed of large <!--del_lnk--> polders. A man made forest, <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdamse Bos, is situated southwest. Amsterdam is connected to the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> through the long <!--del_lnk--> North Sea Canal.</p>
       <p>Amsterdam is intensely urbanized, as is the <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam metropolitan area surrounding the city. Comprising 219.4 square kilometres of land, the <!--del_lnk--> city proper has 4,457 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> and 2,275 houses per km<sup>2</sup>. Parks and <!--del_lnk--> nature reserves make up 12% of Amsterdam's land area.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
       <p>Amsterdam has an <a href="../../wp/o/Oceanic_climate.htm" title="Oceanic climate">oceanic climate</a> (<!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;ppen climate classification <i>Cfb</i>), strongly influenced by its proximity to the North Sea to the west, with prevailing westerly winds. Winters are mild. Amsterdam, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in <!--del_lnk--> USDA <!--del_lnk--> Hardiness zone 8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant <!--del_lnk--> heat-island effect, nights rarely fall below <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;5 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(23&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, while it could easily be <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;12 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(10&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> in Hilversum, 25 kilometres southeast. Summers are moderately warm but rarely hot. The average daily high in August is <span style="white-space:nowrap;">22.1 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(71.8&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">30 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(86&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> or higher is only measured on average on 2.5 days, placing Amsterdam in AHS Heat Zone 2. The record extremes range from <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;24 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(&minus;11&nbsp;&deg;F)</span> to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">36.8 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(98.2&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>. Days with measurable <!--del_lnk--> precipitation are common, on average 187 days per year. Amsterdam's average annual precipitation is 915 millimetres (36.0&nbsp;in). A large part of this precipitation falls as light rain or brief showers. Cloudy and damp days are common during the cooler months of October through March.</p>

       <p>Amsterdam has a population of 800,000 inhabitants. On 1 January 2012, the ethnic makeup of Amsterdam was 49.5% Dutch and 50.5% foreigners. In the 16th and 17th century non-Dutch immigrants to Amsterdam were mostly <!--del_lnk--> Huguenots, <!--del_lnk--> Flemings, <!--del_lnk--> Sephardi Jews and <!--del_lnk--> Westphalians. Huguenots came after the <!--del_lnk--> Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the <!--del_lnk--> Eighty Years' War. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons &ndash; their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was <!--del_lnk--> Jewish.</p>
       <p>The first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch East Indies in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s <!--del_lnk--> guest workers from Turkey, Morocco, Italy and Spain emigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of <!--del_lnk--> Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the <!--del_lnk--> Bijlmer area. Other immigrants, including refugees <!--del_lnk--> asylum seekers and <!--del_lnk--> illegal immigrants, came from Europe, <!--del_lnk--> America, Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many 'old' Amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like <!--del_lnk--> Almere and <!--del_lnk--> Purmerend, prompted by the third <!--del_lnk--> planological bill of the Dutch government. This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so called "groeikernen", literally "cores of growth". Young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de Pijp and the <!--del_lnk--> Jordaan abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the <!--del_lnk--> social housing projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer. Today, people of non-Western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 50% of children.</p>
       <p>The largest <!--del_lnk--> religious group are Christians (17% in 2000), who are divided between Roman Catholics and Protestants. The next largest religion is Islam (14% in 2000), most of whose followers are <!--del_lnk--> Sunni.</p>
       <p>In 1578 the previously Roman Catholic city of Amsterdam joined the revolt against Spanish rule, late in comparison to other major northern Dutch cities. In line with Protestant procedure of that time, all churches were converted to Protestant worship. <!--del_lnk--> Calvinism became the dominant religion, and although Catholicism was not forbidden and priests allowed to serve, the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic hierarchy was prohibited. This led to the establishment of <i>schuilkerken</i>, covert churches, behind seemingly ordinary canal side house fronts. One example is the current debate centre <!--del_lnk--> de Rode Hoed. A large influx of foreigners of many religions came to 17th-century Amsterdam, in particular <!--del_lnk--> Sefardic Jews from Spain and Portugal, <!--del_lnk--> Huguenots from France, and Protestants from the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Netherlands. This led to the establishment of many non-Dutch-speaking religious churches. In 1603, the first notification was made of Jewish religious service. In 1639, the first synagogue was consecrated. The Jews came to call the town <!--del_lnk--> Jerusalem of the West, a reference to their sense of belonging there.</p>

       <p>As they became established in the city, other <!--del_lnk--> Christian denominations used converted Catholic chapels to conduct their own services. The oldest English-language church congregation in the world outside the United Kingdom is found at the <!--del_lnk--> Begijnhof. Regular services there are still offered in English under the auspices of the Church of Scotland. The Huguenots accounted for nearly 20% of Amsterdam's inhabitants in 1700. Being Calvinists, they soon integrated into the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Reformed Church, though often retaining their own congregations. Some, commonly referred by the moniker 'Walloon', are recognizable today as they offer occasional services in French.</p>
       <p>In the second half of the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced an influx of <!--del_lnk--> Ashkenazim, Jews from <a href="../../wp/c/Central_Europe.htm" title="Central Europe">Central and Eastern Europe</a>, which continued into the 19th century. Jews often fled the <!--del_lnk--> pogroms in those areas. The first Ashkenazi who arrived in Amsterdam were <!--del_lnk--> refugees from the <!--del_lnk--> Chmielnicki Uprising in Poland and the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years' War. They not only founded their own synagogues, but had a strong influence on the 'Amsterdam dialect' adding a large <!--del_lnk--> Yiddish local vocabulary.</p>
       <p>Despite an absence of an official Jewish <!--del_lnk--> ghetto, most Jews preferred to live in the eastern part of the old medieval heart of the city. The main street of this Jewish neighbourhood was the <i>Jodenbreestraat</i>. The neighbourhood comprised the <i>Waterlooplein</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> Nieuwmarkt. Buildings in this neighborhood fell into disrepair after the Second World War, and a large section of the neighbourhood was demolished during the construction of the subway. This led to riots, and as a result the original plans for large-scale reconstruction were abandoned and the neighbourhood was rebuilt with smaller-scale residence buildings on the basis of its original layout.</p>

       <p>Catholic Churches in Amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in 1853. One of the principal architects behind the city's Catholic churches, <!--del_lnk--> Cuypers, was also responsible for the Amsterdam Central Station and the <!--del_lnk--> Rijksmuseum, which led to a refusal of Protestant King <!--del_lnk--> William III to open 'that monastery'. In 1924, <a href="../../wp/c/Catholic_Church.htm" title="Catholic Church">the Roman Catholic Church</a> of the Netherlands hosted the <!--del_lnk--> International Eucharistic Congress in Amsterdam, and numerous Catholic <!--del_lnk--> prelates visited the city, where festivities were held in churches and stadiums. Catholic processions on the public streets, however, were still forbidden under law at the time. Only in the 20th century was Amsterdam's relation to Catholicism normalized, but despite its far larger <!--del_lnk--> population size, the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic clergy chose to place its episcopal see of the city in the nearby provincial town of <!--del_lnk--> Haarlem.</p>
       <p>In recent times, religious demographics in Amsterdam have been changed by large-scale immigration from former colonies. Immigrants from Suriname have introduced <!--del_lnk--> Evangelical Protestantism and <!--del_lnk--> Lutheranism, from the Hernhutter variety; <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> has been introduced mainly from Suriname; and several distinct branches of Islam have been brought from various parts of the world. Islam is now the largest non-Christian religion in Amsterdam. The large community of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants have established African churches, often in parking garages in the <!--del_lnk--> Bijlmer area, where many have settled. In addition, a broad array of other religious movements have established congregations, including <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>.</p>

       <p>Although the saying "Leef en laat leven" or "Live and let live" summarizes the Dutch and especially the Amsterdam open and tolerant society, the increased influx of many races, religions, and cultures after the Second World War, has on a number of occasions strained <!--del_lnk--> social relations. With 176 different nationalities, Amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world. The immigrant share of the population in the city proper now counts about 50%.</p>
       <p>Despite the presentation and common perception of Amsterdam as an open and tolerant society, especially the non-western minorities experience increasing degree of cultural suppression. Among others, in line with the well publicized negative attitude changes in Dutch politics towards certain (especially Islamic) minorities, Turkish-language and Arabic-language TV channels (Turks and Moroccans constitute the biggest immigrant communities) have been dropped from the basic cable TV package. In recent years, politicians are actively discouraged against campaigning in minority languages. In the previous local elections politicians were criticized by current Amsterdam mayor Mr van der Laan (then minister of Integration) for distributing election leaflets in minority languages and in some cases leaflets were collected. Due to this anti-Multicultural stand in a multicultural city, van der Laan has been accused of hypocrisy by its own party's <!--del_lnk--> PvdA main candidate. Also during the same period, possibly due to his belief in integration via (possibly not always voluntary) assimilation, Amsterdam has been one of the municipalities in the Netherlands which provided immigrants with extensive and totally free Dutch language courses. Although this has been largely funded by central Dutch government, in terms efficiency and widespread use, Amsterdam has been in the forefronts of this programme. This has benefited many immigrants.</p>

       <p>Amsterdam fans out south from the <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam Centraal railway station. The <!--del_lnk--> Damrak is the <!--del_lnk--> main street and leads into the street <!--del_lnk--> Rokin. The oldest area of the town is known as <i><!--del_lnk--> de Wallen</i> (the quays). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city's famous red light district. To the south of de Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein. The 17th century <!--del_lnk--> canals of Amsterdam, known as the <i>Grachtengordel</i>, embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working class areas of <!--del_lnk--> Jordaan and de Pijp. The <!--del_lnk--> Museumplein with the city's major museums, the <!--del_lnk--> Vondelpark, a 19th century park named after the Dutch writer <!--del_lnk--> Joost van den Vondel, and <!--del_lnk--> the Plantage neighbourhood, with the <!--del_lnk--> zoo, are also located outside the Grachtengordel.</p>
       <p>Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are <!--del_lnk--> polders. This can be recognised by the suffix <i>-meer</i> which means <i>lake</i>, as in <!--del_lnk--> Aalsmeer, <!--del_lnk--> Bijlmermeer, <!--del_lnk--> Haarlemmermeer, and <!--del_lnk--> Watergraafsmeer.</p>

       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Canals">Canals</span></h3>
       <p>The Amsterdam canal system is the result of conscious <!--del_lnk--> city planning. In the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the <!--del_lnk--> IJ bay. Known as the <i>Grachtengordel</i>, three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the <i><!--del_lnk--> Herengracht</i> (where "Heren" refers to <i>Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam</i> (ruling lords of Amsterdam), and <i>gracht</i> means canal, so the name can be roughly translated as "Canal of the lords"), <i><!--del_lnk--> Keizersgracht</i> (Emperor's Canal), and <i><!--del_lnk--> Prinsengracht</i> (Prince's Canal). The fourth and outermost canal is the <i>Singelgracht</i>, which is often not mentioned on maps, because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and most inner canal <i><!--del_lnk--> Singel</i>. The canals served for defence, <!--del_lnk--> water management and transport. The defences took the form of a moat and <!--del_lnk--> earthen dikes, with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry <!--del_lnk--> superstructures. The original plans have been lost, so historians, such as Ed Taverne, need to speculate on the original intentions: it is thought that the considerations of the layout were purely practical and defensive rather than ornamental.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic <!--del_lnk--> windshield wiper as the historian <!--del_lnk--> Geert Mak calls it &ndash; and <i>not</i> from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.</p>

        </div>

       <p>Over the years, several canals have been filled in, becoming streets or squares, such as the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal and the <!--del_lnk--> Spui.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Expansion">Expansion</span></h3>
       <p>After the development of Amsterdam's canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century, <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Sarphati devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings and streets just outside the <i>grachtengordel</i>. The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve <!--del_lnk--> public health. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest <!--del_lnk--> public buildings to date, like the <i>Paleis voor Volksvlijt</i>.</p>
       <p>Following Sarphati, <i>Van Niftrik</i> and <i>Kalff</i> designed an entire ring of 19th century neighbourhoods surrounding the city&rsquo;s centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th century limit, thus firmly controlling development. Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.</p>
       <p>In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before: <i>Plan Zuid</i>, designed by the architect <!--del_lnk--> Berlage, and <i>West</i>. These plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of <i>housing blocks</i> for all social classes.</p>
       <p>After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">motor car</a>. The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the <i>Westelijke Tuinsteden</i>. The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the <i>Bijlmer</i>.</p>

       <p>Amsterdam has a rich <!--del_lnk--> architectural history. The oldest building in Amsterdam is the <!--del_lnk--> Oude Kerk (Old Church), at the heart of the Wallen, consecrated in 1306. The oldest wooden building is <i><!--del_lnk--> het Houten Huys</i> at the <!--del_lnk--> Begijnhof. It was constructed around 1425 and is one of only two existing wooden buildings. It is also one of the few examples of <!--del_lnk--> Gothic architecture in Amsterdam. In the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. During this period, many buildings were constructed in the <!--del_lnk--> architectural style of the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their <!--del_lnk--> stepped gable fa&ccedil;ades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own <!--del_lnk--> Renaissance architecture. These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect <!--del_lnk--> Hendrick de Keyser. One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyer is the <!--del_lnk--> Westerkerk. In the 17th century <!--del_lnk--> baroque architecture became very popular, as it was elsewhere in Europe. This roughly coincided with Amsterdam&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age. The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were <!--del_lnk--> Jacob van Campen, <!--del_lnk--> Philip Vingboons and <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Stalpaert.</p>

       <p>Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants' houses throughout the city. A famous building in <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">baroque style</a> in Amsterdam is the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Palace on <!--del_lnk--> Dam Square. Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by <!--del_lnk--> French culture. This is reflected in the architecture of that period. Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles. Most Gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a <!--del_lnk--> neo-gothic style. At the end of the 19th century, the <a href="../../wp/a/Art_Nouveau.htm" title="Art Nouveau">Jugendstil</a> or <a href="../../wp/a/Art_Nouveau.htm" title="Art Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the <!--del_lnk--> Museum Square in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the <a href="../../wp/m/Modern_history.htm" title="Modern history">modern era</a> was <!--del_lnk--> Art Deco. Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdamse School. Whole districts were built this style, such as the <i>Rivierenbuurt</i>. A notable feature of the fa&ccedil;ades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors.</p>
       <p>The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century. Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the city&rsquo;s centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early 20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre. Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Parks_and_recreational_areas">Parks and recreational areas</span></h3>
       <p>Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. <!--del_lnk--> Vondelpark, the largest park in the city, is located in the <!--del_lnk--> Oud-Zuid borough and is named after the 17th century Amsterdam author, <!--del_lnk--> Joost van den Vondel. Yearly, the park has around 10 million visitors. In the park is an open air theatre, a playground and several <!--del_lnk--> horeca facilities. In the <!--del_lnk--> Zuid borough, is <!--del_lnk--> Beatrixpark, named after <!--del_lnk--> Queen Beatrix. Between Amsterdam and <!--del_lnk--> Amstelveen is the <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdamse Bos (Amsterdam Forest), the largest recreational area in Amsterdam. Annually, almost 4.5 million people visit the park, which has a size of 1,000 <!--del_lnk--> hectares and is approximately three times the size of <!--del_lnk--> Central Park. <!--del_lnk--> Amstelpark in the <!--del_lnk--> Zuid borough houses the Rieker windmill, which dates to 1636. Other parks include <!--del_lnk--> Sarphatipark in the <!--del_lnk--> De Pijp neighbourhood, <!--del_lnk--> Oosterpark in the <!--del_lnk--> Oost borough, and <!--del_lnk--> Westerpark in the <!--del_lnk--> Westerpark neighbourhood. The city has four beaches, the Nemo Beach), Citybeach "Het stenen hoofd" (Silodam), Blijburg, and one in <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam-Noord.</p>
       <p>The city has many open squares (plein in Dutch). The namesake of the city as the site of the original dam, <!--del_lnk--> Dam Square, is the main town square and has the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Palace and <!--del_lnk--> National Monument. <!--del_lnk--> Museumplein hosts various museums, including the <!--del_lnk--> Rijksmuseum, <!--del_lnk--> Van Gogh Museum, and <!--del_lnk--> Stedelijk Museum. Other squares include <!--del_lnk--> Rembrandtplein, <!--del_lnk--> Muntplein, <!--del_lnk--> Nieuwmarkt, <!--del_lnk--> Leidseplein, <!--del_lnk--> Spui, and <!--del_lnk--> Waterlooplein.</p>

       <p>Amsterdam is the financial and business capital of the Netherlands. Amsterdam is currently one of the best European cities in which to locate an <!--del_lnk--> International Business. It is ranked fifth in this category and is only surpassed by <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Frankfurt.htm" title="Frankfurt am Main">Frankfurt</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Barcelona.htm" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. Many large corporations and banks have their headquarters in Amsterdam, including <!--del_lnk--> The Royal Bank of Scotland, <!--del_lnk--> Akzo Nobel, <!--del_lnk--> Heineken International, <!--del_lnk--> ING Group, <!--del_lnk--> Ahold, <!--del_lnk--> TomTom, <!--del_lnk--> Delta Lloyd Group and <!--del_lnk--> Philips. <!--del_lnk--> KPMG International's global headquarters is located in nearby Amstelveen, where many non-Dutch companies have settled as well, because surrounding communities allow full land ownership, contrary to Amsterdam's land-lease system.</p>
       <p>Though many small offices are still located on the old canals, companies are increasingly relocating outside the city centre. The <!--del_lnk--> Zuidas (English: South Axis) has become the new financial and legal hub. The five largest law firms of the Netherlands, a number of Dutch subsidiaries of large consulting firms like <!--del_lnk--> Boston Consulting Group and <!--del_lnk--> Accenture, and the <!--del_lnk--> World Trade Centre Amsterdam are also located in Zuidas.</p>
       <p>There are three other smaller financial districts in Amsterdam. The first is the area surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station, where several newspapers like <!--del_lnk--> De Telegraaf have their offices. Also, <!--del_lnk--> Deloitte, the municipal public transport company (<i>Gemeentelijk Vervoersbedrijf</i>) and the Dutch tax offices (<i>Belastingdienst</i>) are located there. The second <!--del_lnk--> Financial District is the area surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam Arena. The third is the area surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam Amstel railway station. The <!--del_lnk--> tallest building in Amsterdam, the <!--del_lnk--> Rembrandt Tower, is situated there, as is the headquarters of <!--del_lnk--> Philips.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX), now part of <!--del_lnk--> Euronext, is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe's largest bourses. It is situated near <!--del_lnk--> Dam Square in the city's centre.</p>

       <p>Amsterdam is one of the most popular <!--del_lnk--> tourist destinations in Europe, receiving more than 4.63&nbsp;million international visitors annually, this is excluding the 16 million day trippers visiting the city every year. The number of visitors has been growing steadily over the past decade. This can be attributed to an increasing number of European visitors. Two thirds of the hotels are located in the city's centre. Hotels with 4 or 5 stars contribute 42% of the total beds available and 41% of the overnight stays in Amsterdam. The room occupation rate was 78% in 2006, up from 70% in 2005. The majority of tourists (74%) originate from Europe. The largest group of non-European visitors come from the United States, accounting for 14% of the total. Certain years have a theme in Amsterdam to attract extra tourists. For example, the year 2006 was designated "Rembrandt 400", to celebrate the 400th birthday of <a href="../../wp/r/Rembrandt.htm" title="Rembrandt">Rembrandt van Rijn</a>. Some hotels offer special arrangements or activities during these years. The average number of guests per year staying at the four campsites around the city range from 12,000 to 65,000.</p>

Amsterdam's <!--del_lnk--> high-end shops are found in the streets <i>Pieter Cornelisz Hooftstraat</i> and <i>Cornelis Schuytstraat</i>, which are located in the vicinity of the <!--del_lnk--> Vondelpark. One of Amsterdam's busiest high streets is the narrow, medieval <i>Kalverstraat</i> in the heart of the city. Another shopping areas are the <i>Negen Straatjes</i> and Haarlemmerdijk and Haarlemmerstraat. <i>Negen Straatjes</i> are nine narrow streets within the <i>Grachtengordel</i>, the concentric canal system of Amsterdam. The Negen Straatjes differ from other shopping districts with the presence of a large diversity of privately owned shops. The Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk were voted best shopping street in the Netherlands in 2011. These streets have as the <i>Negen Straatjes</i> a large diversity of privately owned shops. But as the <i>Negen Straatjes</i> are dominated by fashion stores the Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk offer a very wide variety of all kinds of stores, just to name some specialties: candy and other food related stores, lingerie, sneakers, wedding clothing, interior shops, books, Italian deli's, racing and mountain bikes, skatewear, etc.</p>
       <p>The city also features a large number of open-air markets such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Albert Cuypmarkt</i>, <i>Westerstraat-markt</i>, <i>Ten Katemarkt</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Dappermarkt</i>.

       <p>During the later part of the 16th century Amsterdam's Rederijkerskamer (<!--del_lnk--> Chamber of Rhetoric) organized contests between different Chambers in the reading of poetry and drama. In 1638, Amsterdam opened its first theatre. Ballet performances were given in this theatre as early as 1642. In the 18th century, French theatre became popular. While Amsterdam was under the influence of German music in the 19th century there were few national opera productions; the Hollandse Opera of Amsterdam was built in 1888 for the specific purpose of promoting Dutch opera. In the 19th century, <a href="../../wp/p/Popular_culture.htm" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> was centred around the Nes area in Amsterdam (mainly <!--del_lnk--> vaudeville and <!--del_lnk--> music-hall). The <!--del_lnk--> metronome, one of the most important advances in <!--del_lnk--> European classical music, was invented here in 1812 by <!--del_lnk--> Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel. At the end of this century, the <!--del_lnk--> Rijksmuseum and <!--del_lnk--> Stedelijk Museum were built. In 1888, the <!--del_lnk--> Concertgebouworkest was established. With the 20th century came cinema, radio and television. Though most studios are located in <!--del_lnk--> Hilversum and <!--del_lnk--> Aalsmeer, Amsterdam's influence on programming is very strong. Many people who work in the television industry live in Amsterdam. Also, the headquarters of <!--del_lnk--> SBS 6 is located in Amsterdam.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Museums">Museums</span></h3>
       <p>The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on the <!--del_lnk--> Museumplein (<i>Museum Square</i>), located at the southwestern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former <!--del_lnk--> World's fair. The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the very large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter. The northwestern part of the square is bordered by the Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, House of Bols Cocktail &amp; Genever Experience and Coster Diamonds. The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated a number of large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A <!--del_lnk--> parking garage can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. <i>Het Museumplein</i> is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realized in 1999, when the square was remodeled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Rijksmuseum possesses the largest and most important collection of classical <!--del_lnk--> Dutch art. It opened in 1885. Its collection consists of nearly one million objects. The artist most associated with Amsterdam is <a href="../../wp/r/Rembrandt.htm" title="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>, whose work, and the work of his pupils, is displayed in the Rijksmuseum. Rembrandt's masterpiece <!--del_lnk--> De Nachtwacht (<i>The Night Watch</i>) is one of top pieces of art of the museum.

       <p><a href="../../wp/v/Vincent_van_Gogh.htm" title="Vincent van Gogh">Van Gogh</a> lived in Amsterdam for a short while and there is a <!--del_lnk--> museum dedicated to his work. The museum is housed in one of the few modern buildings in this area of Amsterdam. The building was designed by <!--del_lnk--> Gerrit Rietveld. This building is where the permanent collection is displayed. A new building was added to the museum in 1999. This building, known as the performance wing, was designed by Japanese architect <!--del_lnk--> Kisho Kurokawa. Its purpose is to house temporary exhibitions of the museum. Some of Van Gogh's most famous paintings, like the <!--del_lnk--> Aardappeleters (<i>The Potato Eaters</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> Zonnebloemen (<i>Sunflowers</i>), are present in the collection. The Van Gogh museum is the most visited museum in Amsterdam.</p>
       <p>Next to the Van Gogh museum stands the <!--del_lnk--> Stedelijk Museum. This is Amsterdam's largest museum concerning <!--del_lnk--> modern art. The museum opened its doors at around the same time the Museum Square was created. The permanent collection consists of works of art from artists like <!--del_lnk--> Piet Mondriaan, <!--del_lnk--> Karel Appel, and <!--del_lnk--> Kazimir Malevich. This museum is also currently being renovated and expanded. The main entrance will be relocated from the Paulus Potterstraat to the Museum Square itself. It will be open again to public in the end of 2011.</p>

       <p>Amsterdam has a world-class symphony orchestra, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Their home is the <!--del_lnk--> Concertgebouw, which is across the Van Baerlestraat from the Museum Square. It is considered by critics to be a <!--del_lnk--> concert hall with some of the best <!--del_lnk--> acoustics in the world. The building contains three <!--del_lnk--> halls, Grote Zaal, Kleine Zaal, and Spiegelzaal. Eight hundred concerts per year are performed there for approximately 850,000 patrons. The opera house of Amsterdam is situated adjacent to the city hall. Therefore, the two buildings combined are often called the <!--del_lnk--> Stopera. This word is derived from the Dutch words <i>stadhuis</i> (city hall) and opera. This huge modern complex, opened in 1986, lies in the former Jewish neighbourhood at <i>Waterlooplein</i> next to the river <!--del_lnk--> Amstel. The <i>Stopera</i> is the homebase of <!--del_lnk--> De Nederlandse Opera, <!--del_lnk--> Het Nationale Ballet and the <!--del_lnk--> Holland Symfonia. <!--del_lnk--> Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ is a <!--del_lnk--> concert hall, which is situated in the <!--del_lnk--> IJ near the central station. Its concerts perform mostly <!--del_lnk--> modern classical music. Located adjacent to it, is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bimhuis</i>, a concert hall for improvised and <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> music.</p>

       <p>Amsterdam has three main theatre buildings.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam at the <!--del_lnk--> Leidseplein is the home base of <!--del_lnk--> Toneelgroep Amsterdam. The current building dates from 1894. Most plays are performed in the Grote Zaal (Great Hall). The normal program of events encompasses all sorts of theatrical forms. The Stadsschouwburg is currently being renovated and expanded. The third theatre space, to be operated jointly with next door <!--del_lnk--> Melkweg, will open in late 2009 or early 2010.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Het Muziektheater, dating from 1986, is the principal <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a> house and home to <!--del_lnk--> De Nederlandse Opera and <!--del_lnk--> Het Nationale Ballet.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Royal Theatre Carr&eacute; was built as a permanent <!--del_lnk--> circus theatre in 1887 and is currently mainly used for <!--del_lnk--> musicals, <!--del_lnk--> cabaret performances and <!--del_lnk--> pop concerts.</p>
       <p>The recently re-opened DeLaMar Theatre houses the more commercial plays and musicals.</p>
       <p>The Netherlands has a tradition of cabaret or <i>kleinkunst</i>, which combines music, storytelling, commentary, theatre and comedy. Cabaret dates back to the 1930s and artists like <!--del_lnk--> Wim Kan, <!--del_lnk--> Wim Sonneveld and <!--del_lnk--> Toon Hermans were pioneers of this form of art in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam is the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy). Contemporary popular artists are <!--del_lnk--> Youp van 't Hek, <!--del_lnk--> Freek de Jonge, <!--del_lnk--> Herman Finkers, <!--del_lnk--> Hans Teeuwen, <!--del_lnk--> Theo Maassen, <!--del_lnk--> Herman van Veen, <!--del_lnk--> Najib Amhali, <!--del_lnk--> Raoul Heertje, <!--del_lnk--> J&ouml;rgen Raymann, <!--del_lnk--> De Vliegende Panters and <!--del_lnk--> Comedytrain. The English spoken comedy scene was established with the founding of <!--del_lnk--> Boom Chicago in 1993. They have their own theatre at Leidseplein.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Nightlife">Nightlife</span></h3>
       <p>Amsterdam is famous for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many <i><!--del_lnk--> caf&eacute;s</i> (bars). They range from large and modern to small and cozy. The typical <i>Bruine Kroeg</i> (brown <i>caf&eacute;</i>) breathe a more old fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. Most <i>caf&eacute;s</i> have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many <!--del_lnk--> discoth&egrave;ques. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the <!--del_lnk--> Leidseplein and the <!--del_lnk--> Rembrandtplein. The <!--del_lnk--> Paradiso, <!--del_lnk--> Melkweg and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discoth&egrave;ques on some nights. Examples of discoth&egrave;ques near the Rembrandtplein are the Escape and Club Home. Also noteworthy are Panama, Hotel Arena (East), The Sand and The Powerzone. <!--del_lnk--> Bimhuis located near the Central Station, with its rich programming hosting the best in the field is considered one of the best jazz clubs in the world. The Reguliersdwarsstraat is the main street for the <!--del_lnk--> LGBT community and nightlife.</p>

       <p>"Amsterdam" is mostly understood to refer to the municipality of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the village of <!--del_lnk--> Durgerdam, may not be considered part of Amsterdam. <!--del_lnk--> Statistics Netherlands uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (<i>Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam</i>, not to be confused with <i>Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam</i>, a synonym of <i>Groot Amsterdam</i>), Greater Amsterdam (<i>Groot Amsterdam</i>, a <!--del_lnk--> COROP region) and the urban region Amsterdam (<i>Stadsgewest Amsterdam</i>). These definitions are not synonymous with the terms urban area and <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area, which are commonly used in <!--del_lnk--> English speaking countries for the purpose of defining large conurbations. The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the <!--del_lnk--> City region Amsterdam. This region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities <!--del_lnk--> Zaanstad and <!--del_lnk--> Wormerland. It excludes <!--del_lnk--> Graft-De Rijp.</p>
       <p>The smallest of these areas is the municipality, with a population of 742,981 in 2006. The metropolitan agglomeration had a population of 1,021,870 in 2006. It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam. Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities, and had a population of 1,211,503 in 2006. Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of <!--del_lnk--> Zaanstad. The largest area by population, the <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (Dutch: Metropoolregio Amsterdam), has a population of 2,22&nbsp;million. It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerveer, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes Graft-De Rijp. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area <!--del_lnk--> Randstad, with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.</p>

       <p>As with all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a <!--del_lnk--> mayor, <!--del_lnk--> aldermen, and the <!--del_lnk--> municipal council. However, unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into seven "<!--del_lnk--> stadsdelen" (boroughs), a system that was implemented in the 1980s to improve local governance. The stadsdelen are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. The city had initially been divided into 15 stadsdelen. 14 of those had their own council, chosen by a popular election. The 15th, <!--del_lnk--> Westpoort, covers the harbour of Amsterdam, had very few residents, and was governed by the central municipal council. Local decisions are made at borough level, and only affairs pertaining to the whole city, such as major infrastructure projects, are handled by the central city council.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="National_government">National government</span></h3>
       <p>Amsterdam is the <!--del_lnk--> capital of the Netherlands in a technical legal sense. The present version of the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch constitution mentions "Amsterdam" and "capital" only in one place, chapter 2, article 32: The king's confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in "the capital Amsterdam" ("<i>de hoofdstad Amsterdam</i>"). Previous versions of the constitution spoke of "the city of Amsterdam" ("<i>de stad Amsterdam</i>"), without mention of capital. In any case, the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> government, <!--del_lnk--> parliament and <!--del_lnk--> supreme court of the Netherlands is (and always has been, with the exception of a brief period between 1808 and 1810) located at <a href="../../wp/t/The_Hague.htm" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>. Foreign embassies are also in The Hague. The capital of North Holland is <!--del_lnk--> Haarlem.</p>

       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Symbols">Symbols</span></h3>
       <p>The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three <!--del_lnk--> St Andrew's crosses, aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's <!--del_lnk--> patron saint was <!--del_lnk--> Saint Nicholas). These St Andrew's crosses can also be found on the cityshields of neighbours <!--del_lnk--> Amstelveen and <!--del_lnk--> Ouder-Amstel. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the <!--del_lnk--> flag of Amsterdam, flown by the city government, but also as <!--del_lnk--> civil ensign for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Crown of Austria. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian I awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the <!--del_lnk--> king's crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's <!--del_lnk--> imperial crown when he was crowned <!--del_lnk--> Holy Roman Emperor. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian's crown in Amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Rudolph II, a crown that became the Imperial <!--del_lnk--> Crown of Austria. The lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Last came the city's official motto: <i>Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig</i> ("Heroic, Determined, Merciful"), bestowed on the city in 1947 by <!--del_lnk--> Queen Wilhelmina, in recognition of the city's bravery during the Second World War.</p>

The local government sponsors <!--del_lnk--> carsharing and <!--del_lnk--> carpooling initiatives such as <i>Autodelen</i> and <i>Meerijden.nu</i>.</p>
       <p>Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by <!--del_lnk--> Connexxion and <!--del_lnk--> Arriva. Currently, there are sixteen <!--del_lnk--> tram lines, and four <!--del_lnk--> metro lines, with a fifth line, the <!--del_lnk--> North/South line, under construction. Three free ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the <!--del_lnk--> IJ to <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam-Noord, and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. There are also water taxis, a water bus, a <!--del_lnk--> boat sharing operation, electric rental boats (Boaty) and canal cruises, that transport people along Amsterdam's waterways.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> A10 ringroad surrounding the city connects Amsterdam with the Dutch <!--del_lnk--> national network of freeways. <!--del_lnk--> Interchanges on the A10 allow cars to enter the city by transferring to one of the 18 <i>city roads</i>, numbered S101 through to S118. These city roads are regional roads without <!--del_lnk--> grade separation, and sometimes without a <!--del_lnk--> central reservation. Most are accessible by cyclists. The S100 <i>Centrumring</i> is a smaller ringroad circumnavigating the city's centre.</p>
       <p>Amsterdam was intended in 1932 to be the hub, a kind of <!--del_lnk--> Kilometre Zero, of the <!--del_lnk--> highway system of the Netherlands, with freeways numbered One to Eight planned to originate from the city. The outbreak of the Second World War and shifting priorities led to the current situation, where only roads <!--del_lnk--> A1, <!--del_lnk--> A2, and <!--del_lnk--> A4 originate from Amsterdam according to the original plan. The A3 road to <a href="../../wp/r/Rotterdam.htm" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> was cancelled in 1970 in order to conserve the <!--del_lnk--> Groene Hart. Road <!--del_lnk--> A8, leading north to <!--del_lnk--> Zaandam and the <!--del_lnk--> A10 <!--del_lnk--> Ringroad were opened between 1968 and 1974. Besides the A1, A2, A4 and A8, several freeways, such as the <!--del_lnk--> A7 and <!--del_lnk--> A6, carry traffic mainly bound for Amsterdam.</p>

       <p>Amsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (Dutch: gymnasia), the <!--del_lnk--> Vossius Gymnasium, <!--del_lnk--> Barlaeus Gymnasium, St. <!--del_lnk--> Ignatius Gymnasium, <!--del_lnk--> Het 4e Gymnasium and the <!--del_lnk--> Cygnus Gymnasium where a classical curriculum including Latin and <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greek.htm" title="Ancient Greek">classical Greek</a> is taught. Though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. Most secondary schools in Amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.</p>

       <p>The housing market is heavily regulated. In Amsterdam, 55% of existing housing and 30% of new housing is owned by Housing Associations, which are Government sponsored entities.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Squat properties are common throughout Amsterdam, due to property law strongly favouring tenants. A number of these squats have become well known, such as <!--del_lnk--> OT301, Vrankrijk (closed down by city government), and the Binnenpret, and several are now businesses, such as health clubs and licensed restaurants.</p>
