       <p><b>Arithmetic</b> or <b>arithmetics</b> (from the <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_language.htm" title="Greek language">Greek</a> word <!--del_lnk--> &#x1F00;&rho;&iota;&theta;&mu;&#x3CC;&sigmaf;, <i>arithmos</i> "<a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">number</a>") is the oldest and most elementary branch of <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, used by almost everyone, for tasks ranging from simple day-to-day counting to advanced <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Business.htm" title="Business">business</a> calculations. It involves the study of <a href="../../wp/q/Quantity.htm" title="Quantity">quantity</a>, especially as the result of operations that combine numbers. In common usage, it refers to the simpler properties when using the traditional <!--del_lnk--> operations of <a href="../../wp/a/Addition.htm" title="Addition">addition</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Subtraction.htm" title="Subtraction">subtraction</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Multiplication.htm" title="Multiplication">multiplication</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Division_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Division (mathematics)">division</a> with smaller values of numbers. Professional <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematician.htm" title="Mathematician">mathematicians</a> sometimes use the term <i>(higher) arithmetic</i> when referring to more advanced results related to <a href="../../wp/n/Number_theory.htm" title="Number theory">number theory</a>, but this should not be confused with <a href="../../wp/e/Elementary_arithmetic.htm" title="Elementary arithmetic">elementary arithmetic</a>.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>The prehistory of arithmetic is limited to a small number of artifacts which may indicate conception of addition and subtraction, the best-known being the <a href="../../wp/i/Ishango_bone.htm" title="Ishango bone">Ishango bone</a> from <a href="../../wp/d/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo.htm" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">central Africa</a>, dating from somewhere between 20,000 and 18,000&nbsp;BC although its interpretation is disputed.</p>
       <p>The earliest written records indicate the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians and <!--del_lnk--> Babylonians used all the elementary arithmetic operations as early as 2000&nbsp;BC. These artifacts do not always reveal the specific process used for solving problems, but the characteristics of the particular <a href="../../wp/n/Numeral_system.htm" title="Numeral system">numeral system</a> strongly influence the complexity of the methods. The hieroglyphic system for <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian numerals, like the later <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_numerals.htm" title="Roman numerals">Roman numerals</a>, descended from <!--del_lnk--> tally marks used for counting. In both cases, this origin resulted in values that used a <a href="../../wp/d/Decimal.htm" title="Decimal">decimal</a> base but did not include <!--del_lnk--> positional notation. Complex calculations with Roman numerals required the assistance of a <!--del_lnk--> counting board or the <!--del_lnk--> Roman abacus to obtain the results.</p>
       <p>Early number systems that included positional notation were not decimal, including the <!--del_lnk--> sexagesimal (base 60) system for <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian numerals and the <!--del_lnk--> vigesimal (base 20) system that defined <!--del_lnk--> Maya numerals. Because of this place-value concept, the ability to reuse the same digits for different values contributed to simpler and more efficient methods of calculation.</p>
       <p>The continuous historical development of modern arithmetic starts with the <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic civilization of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of <a href="../../wp/e/Euclid.htm" title="Euclid">Euclid</a> around 300&nbsp;BC, <!--del_lnk--> Greek studies in mathematics overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Nicomachus summarized the viewpoint of the earlier <!--del_lnk--> Pythagorean approach to numbers, and their relationships to each other, in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Introduction to Arithmetic</i>.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Greek numerals, derived from the hieratic Egyptian system, also lacked positional notation, and therefore imposed the same complexity on the basic operations of arithmetic. For example, the ancient mathematician <a href="../../wp/a/Archimedes.htm" title="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> devoted his entire work <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sand Reckoner</i> merely to devising a notation for a certain large integer.</p>
       <p>The gradual development of <!--del_lnk--> Hindu-Arabic numerals independently devised the place-value concept and positional notation, which combined the simpler methods for computations with a decimal base and the use of a digit representing <a href="../../wp/0/0_%2528number%2529.htm" title="0 (number)">zero</a>. This allowed the system to consistently represent both large and small integers. This approach eventually replaced all other systems. In the early <span class="nowrap">6th century AD,</span> the Indian mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Aryabhata incorporated an existing version of this system in his work, and experimented with different notations. In the 7th&nbsp;century, <!--del_lnk--> Brahmagupta established the use of zero as a separate number and determined the results for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of zero and all other numbers, except for the result of <!--del_lnk--> division by zero. His contemporary, the <!--del_lnk--> Syriac bishop <!--del_lnk--> Severus Sebokht described the excellence of this system as "...&nbsp;valuable methods of calculation which surpass description". The Arabs also learned this new method and called it <i>hesab</i>.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Although the <!--del_lnk--> Codex Vigilanus described an early form of Arabic numerals (omitting zero) by 976&nbsp;AD, <!--del_lnk--> Fibonacci was primarily responsible for spreading their use throughout Europe after the publication of his book <i><!--del_lnk--> Liber Abaci</i> in 1202. He considered the significance of this "new" representation of numbers, which he styled the "Method of the Indians" (Latin <i>Modus Indorum</i>), so fundamental that all related mathematical foundations, including the results of <a href="../../wp/p/Pythagoras.htm" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> algorism describing the methods for performing actual calculations, were "almost a mistake" in comparison.</p>
       <p>In the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, arithmetic was one of the seven <!--del_lnk--> liberal arts taught in universities.</p>
       <p>The flourishing of <a href="../../wp/a/Algebra.htm" title="Algebra">algebra</a> in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Medieval">medieval</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islamic">Islamic</a> world and in <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> was an outgrowth of the enormous simplification of <!--del_lnk--> computation through <a href="../../wp/d/Decimal.htm" title="Decimal">decimal</a> notation.</p>
       <p>Various types of tools exist to assist in numeric calculations. Examples include <!--del_lnk--> slide rules (for multiplication, division, and trigonometry) and <!--del_lnk--> nomographs in addition to the electrical <a href="../../wp/c/Calculator.htm" title="Calculator">calculator</a>.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Arithmetic_operations">Arithmetic operations</span></h2>
       <p>The basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, although this subject also includes more advanced operations, such as manipulations of <a href="../../wp/p/Percentage.htm" title="Percentage">percentages</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Square_root.htm" title="Square root">square roots</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Exponentiation.htm" title="Exponentiation">exponentiation</a>, and <a href="../../wp/l/Logarithm.htm" title="Logarithm">logarithmic functions</a>. Arithmetic is performed according to an <!--del_lnk--> order of operations. Any set of objects upon which all four arithmetic operations (except division by zero) can be performed, and where these four operations obey the usual laws, is called a <!--del_lnk--> field.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Addition_.28.2B.29">Addition (+)</span></h3>
       <p>Addition is the basic operation of arithmetic. In its simplest form, addition combines two numbers, the <i>addends</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> terms</i>, into a single number, the <i>sum</i> of the numbers.</p>
       <p>Adding more than two numbers can be viewed as repeated addition; this procedure is known as <!--del_lnk--> summation and includes ways to add infinitely many numbers in an <!--del_lnk--> infinite series; repeated addition of the number <a href="../../wp/1/1_%2528number%2529.htm" title="1 (number)">one</a> is the most basic form of <!--del_lnk--> counting.</p>
       <p>Addition is <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Commutative_property.htm" title="Commutative">commutative</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Associative_property.htm" title="Associative">associative</a> so the order the terms are added in does not matter. The <!--del_lnk--> identity element of addition (the <!--del_lnk--> additive identity) is 0, that is, adding&nbsp;0 to any number yields that same number. Also, the <!--del_lnk--> inverse element of addition (the <!--del_lnk--> additive inverse) is the opposite of any number, that is, adding the opposite of any number to the number itself yields the additive identity,&nbsp;0. For example, the opposite of 7 is &minus;7, so <span class="texhtml">7 + (&minus;7) = 0</span>.</p>
       <p>Addition can be given geometrically as in the following example:</p>
       <dl>
        <dd>If we have two sticks of lengths <i>2</i> and <i>5</i>, then if we place the sticks one after the other, the length of the stick thus formed is <span class="texhtml">2 + 5 = 7</span>.</dd>
       </dl>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Subtraction_.28.E2.88.92.29">Subtraction (&minus;)</span></h3>
       <p>Subtraction is the opposite of addition. Subtraction finds the <i>difference</i> between two numbers, the <i>minuend</i> minus the <i>subtrahend</i>. If the minuend is larger than the subtrahend, the difference is positive; if the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference is negative; if they are equal, the difference is zero.</p>
       <p>Subtraction is neither commutative nor associative. For that reason, it is often helpful to look at subtraction as addition of the minuend and the opposite of the subtrahend, that is <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i> &minus; <i>b</i> = <i>a</i> + (&minus;<i>b</i>)</span>. When written as a sum, all the properties of addition hold.</p>
       <p>There are several methods for calculating results, some of which are particularly advantageous to machine calculation. For example, digital computers employ the method of <!--del_lnk--> two's complement. Of great importance is the counting up method by which change is made. Suppose an amount <i>P</i> is given to pay the required amount <i>Q</i>, with <i>P</i> greater than <i>Q</i>. Rather than performing the subtraction <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i> &minus; <i>Q</i></span> and counting out that amount in change, money is counted out starting at <i>Q</i> and continuing until reaching <i>P</i>. Although the amount counted out must equal the result of the subtraction <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i> &minus; <i>Q</i></span>, the subtraction was never really done and the value of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i> &minus; <i>Q</i></span> might still be unknown to the change-maker.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Multiplication_.28.C3.97_or_.C2.B7_or_.2A.29">Multiplication (&times; or &middot; or *)</span></h3>
       <p>Multiplication is the second basic operation of arithmetic. Multiplication also combines two numbers into a single number, the <i>product</i>. The two original numbers are called the <i>multiplier</i> and the <i>multiplicand</i>, sometimes both simply called <i>factors</i>.</p>
       <p>Multiplication is best viewed as a scaling operation. If the numbers are imagined as lying in a line, multiplication by a number, say <i>x</i>, greater than 1 is the same as stretching everything away from 0 uniformly, in such a way that the number 1 itself is stretched to where <i>x</i> was. Similarly, multiplying by a number less than 1 can be imagined as squeezing towards 0. (Again, in such a way that 1 goes to the multiplicand.)</p>
       <p>Multiplication is commutative and associative; further it is <!--del_lnk--> distributive over addition and subtraction. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/1/1_%2528number%2529.htm" title="Multiplicative identity">multiplicative identity</a> is 1, that is, multiplying any number by 1 yields that same number. Also, the <!--del_lnk--> multiplicative inverse is the <!--del_lnk--> reciprocal of any number (except zero; zero is the only number without a multiplicative inverse), that is, multiplying the reciprocal of any number by the number itself yields the multiplicative identity.</p>
       <p>The product of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is written as <span class="nowrap"><i>a</i> &times; <i>b</i></span> or <span class="nowrap"><i>a</i> &bull; <i>b</i></span>. When <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> are expressions not written simply with digits, it is also written by simple juxtaposition:&nbsp;<i>ab</i>. In computer programming languages and software packages in which one can only use characters normally found on a keyboard, it is often written with an <span class="nowrap">asterisk: <i>a</i> * <i>b</i>.</span></p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Division_.28.C3.B7_or_.2F.29">Division (&divide; or /)</span></h3>
       <p>Division is essentially the opposite of multiplication. Division finds the <i>quotient</i> of two numbers, the <i>dividend</i> divided by the <i>divisor</i>. Any dividend <!--del_lnk--> divided by zero is undefined. For positive numbers, if the dividend is larger than the divisor, the quotient is greater than one, otherwise it is less than one (a similar rule applies for negative numbers). The quotient multiplied by the divisor always yields the dividend.</p>
       <p>Division is neither commutative nor associative. As it is helpful to look at subtraction as addition, it is helpful to look at division as multiplication of the dividend times the <!--del_lnk--> reciprocal of the divisor, that is <span class="nowrap"><i>a</i> &divide; <i>b</i> = <i>a</i> &times; <span class="frac nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>b</i></sub></span>.</span> When written as a product, it obeys all the properties of multiplication.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Decimal_arithmetic">Decimal arithmetic</span></h2>
       <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Decimal representation</b> refers exclusively, in common use, to the written <a href="../../wp/n/Numeral_system.htm" title="Numeral system">numeral system</a> employing <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_numerals.htm" title="Arabic numerals">arabic numerals</a> as the <a href="../../wp/n/Numerical_digit.htm" title="Numerical digit">digits</a> for a <!--del_lnk--> radix <a href="../../wp/d/Decimal.htm" title="Decimal">10 ("decimal")</a> <!--del_lnk--> positional notation; however, any <a href="../../wp/n/Numeral_system.htm" title="Numeral system">numeral system</a> based on powers of 10, e.g., <!--del_lnk--> Greek, <!--del_lnk--> Cyrillic, <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_numerals.htm" title="Roman numerals">Roman</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> Chinese <a href="../../wp/n/Numeral_system.htm" title="Numeral system">numerals</a> may conceptually be described as "decimal notation" or "decimal representation".</p>
       <p>Modern methods for four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) were first devised by <!--del_lnk--> Brahmagupta of India. This was known during medieval Europe as "Modus Indoram" or Method of the Indians. Positional notation (also known as "place-value notation") refers to the representation or encoding of <a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">numbers</a> using the same symbol for the different <!--del_lnk--> orders of magnitude (e.g., the "ones place", "tens place", "hundreds place") and, with a <!--del_lnk--> radix point, using those same symbols to represent <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fraction_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Arithmetic fraction">fractions</a> (e.g., the "tenths place", "hundredths place"). For example, 507.36 denotes 5 hundreds (10<sup>2</sup>), plus 0 tens (10<sup>1</sup>), plus 7 units (10<sup>0</sup>), plus 3 tenths (10<sup>&minus;1</sup>) plus 6 hundredths (10<sup>&minus;2</sup>).</p>
       <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/0/0_%2528number%2529.htm" title="Zero">Zero</a> as a number comparable to the other basic digits is a concept that is essential to this notation, as is the concept of zero's use as a placeholder, and as is the definition of multiplication and addition with zero. The use of zero as a placeholder and, therefore, the use of a positional notation is first attested to in the <!--del_lnk--> Jain text from <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> entitled the <i><!--del_lnk--> Lokavibh&acirc;ga</i>, dated 458&nbsp;AD and it was only in the early 13th&nbsp;century that these concepts, transmitted via the <!--del_lnk--> scholarship of the Arabic world, were introduced into <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Fibonacci using the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu-Arabic numeral system.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Algorism comprises all of the rules for performing arithmetic computations using this type of written numeral. For example, addition produces the sum of two arbitrary numbers. The result is calculated by the repeated addition of single digits from each number that occupies the same position, proceeding from right to left. An addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each sum. If an individual sum exceeds the value nine, the result is represented with two digits. The rightmost digit is the value for the current position, and the result for the subsequent addition of the digits to the left increases by the value of the second (leftmost) digit, which is always one. This adjustment is termed a <i>carry</i> of the value one.</p>
       <p>The process for multiplying two arbitrary numbers is similar to the process for addition. A multiplication table with ten rows and ten columns lists the results for each pair of digits. If an individual product of a pair of digits exceeds nine, the <i>carry</i> adjustment increases the result of any subsequent multiplication from digits to the left by a value equal to the second (leftmost) digit, which is any value from one to eight <span class="nowrap">(9 &times; 9 = 81)</span>. Additional steps define the final result.</p>
       <p>Similar techniques exist for subtraction and division.</p>
       <p>The creation of a correct process for multiplication relies on the relationship between values of adjacent digits. The value for any single digit in a numeral depends on its position. Also, each position to the left represents a value ten times larger than the position to the right. In mathematical terms, the <a href="../../wp/e/Exponentiation.htm" title="Exponentiation">exponent</a> for the <!--del_lnk--> radix (base) of ten increases by one (to the left) or decreases by one (to the right). Therefore, the value for any arbitrary digit is multiplied by a value of the form 10<sup><i>n</i></sup> with <a href="../../wp/i/Integer.htm" title="Integer">integer</a>&nbsp;<i>n</i>. The list of values corresponding to all possible positions for a single digit is written <span class="nowrap">as {..., 10<sup>2</sup>, 10, 1, 10<sup>&minus;1</sup>, 10<sup>&minus;2</sup>, ...}.</span></p>
       <p>Repeated multiplication of any value in this list by ten produces another value in the list. In mathematical terminology, this characteristic is defined as <!--del_lnk--> closure, and the previous list is described as <b>closed under multiplication</b>. It is the basis for correctly finding the results of multiplication using the previous technique. This outcome is one example of the uses of <a href="../../wp/n/Number_theory.htm" title="Number theory">number theory</a>.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Compound_unit_arithmetic">Compound unit arithmetic<span id="Compound_Unit_Arithmetic"></span></span></h2>
       <p>Compound unit arithmetic is the application of arithmetic operations to <!--del_lnk--> mixed radix quantities such as feet and inches, gallons and pints, pounds shillings and pence, and so on. Prior to the use of decimal-based systems of money and units of measure, the use of compound unit arithmetic formed a significant part of commerce and industry.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_arithmetic_operations">Basic arithmetic operations</span></h3>
       <p>The techniques used for compound unit arithmetic was developed over many centuries and are well-documented in many textbooks in many different languages. In addition to the basic arithmetic functions encountered in decimal arithmetic, compound unit arithmetic employs three more functions:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Reduction</b> where a compound quantity is reduced to a single quantity, for example conversion of a distance expressed in yards, feet and inches to one expressed in inches.</li>
        <li><b>Expansion</b>, the <a href="../../wp/i/Inverse_function.htm" title="Inverse function">inverse function</a> to reduction, is the conversion of a quantity that is expressed as a single unit of measure to a compound unit, such as expanding 24&nbsp;oz to <span class="nowrap">1 lb, 8 oz</span>.</li>
        <li><b>Normalisation</b> is the conversion of a set of compound units to a standard form &ndash; for example rewriting "<span class="nowrap">1 ft 13 in</span>" as "<span class="nowrap">2 ft 1 in</span>".</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Knowledge of the relationship between the various units of measure, their multiples and their submultiples forms an essential part of compound unit arithmetic.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Principles_of_compound_unit_arithmetic">Principles of compound unit arithmetic</span></h3>
       <p>There are two basic approaches to compound unit arithmetic:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Reduction&ndash;expansion method</b> where all the compound unit variables are reduced to single unit variables, the calculation performed and the result expanded back to compound units. This approach suited for automated calculations. A typical example is the handling of time by <!--del_lnk--> Microsoft Excel where all time intervals are processed internally as days and decimal fractions of a day.</li>
        <li><b>On-going normalisation method</b> in which each unit is treated separately and the problem is continuously normalised as the solution develops. This approach, which is widely described in classical texts, is best suited for manual calculations. An example of the on-going normalisation method as applied to addition is shown below.</li>

       <p>The addition operation is carried out from right to left; in this case, pence are processed first, then shillings followed by pounds. The numbers below the "answer line" are intermediate results.</p>
       <p>The total in the pence column is 25. Since there are 12 pennies in a shilling, the number 24 is divided by 12 to give 2 with a remainder of 1. The value "1" is then written to the answer row and the value "2" carried forward to the shillings column. This operation is repeated using the values in the shillings column, with the additional step of adding the value that was carried forward from the pennies column. The intermediate total is divided by 20 rather than 12 as there are 20 shillings in a pound. The pound column is then processed, but as pounds are the largest unit that is being considered, no values are carried forward from the pounds column.</p>
       <p>It should be noted that for the sake of simplicity, the example chosen did not have farthings.</p>

       <p>During the 19th and 20th centuries various aids were developed to aid the manipulation of compound units, particularly in commercial applications. The most common aids were mechanical tills which were adapted in countries such as the United Kingdom to accommodate pounds, shillings, pennies and farthings and "Ready Reckoners" &ndash; books aimed at traders that catalogued the results of various routine calculations such as the percentages or multiples of various sums of money. One typical booklet that ran to 150 pages tabulated multiples "from one to ten thousand at the various prices from one farthing to one pound".</p>
       <p>The cumbersome nature of compound unit arithmetic has been recognised for many years &ndash; in 1586, the Flemish mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called <i>De Thiende</i> ("the tenth") in which he declared that the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time while in the modern era, many conversion programs, such as that embedded in the calculator supplied as a standard part of the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system display compound units in a reduced decimal format rather than using an expanded format (i.e. "2.5&nbsp;ft" is displayed rather than <span class="nowrap">"2 ft 6 in"</span>).</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Number_theory">Number theory</span></h2>
       <p>The term <i>arithmetic</i> also refers to number theory. This includes the properties of integers related to <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_number.htm" title="Prime number">primality</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Divisor.htm" title="Divisibility">divisibility</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> solution of equations in integers, as well as modern research that is an outgrowth of this study. It is in this context that one runs across the <a href="../../wp/f/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic.htm" title="Fundamental theorem of arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a> and <!--del_lnk--> arithmetic functions. <i>A Course in Arithmetic</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Pierre Serre reflects this usage, as do such phrases such as <i>first-order arithmetic</i> or <i>arithmetical algebraic geometry</i>. Number theory is also referred to as <i>the higher arithmetic</i>, as in the title of <!--del_lnk--> Harold Davenport's book on the subject.</p>

       <p><a href="../../wp/p/Primary_education.htm" title="Primary education">Primary education</a> in mathematics often places a strong focus on algorithms for the arithmetic of <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_number.htm" title="Natural number">natural numbers</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Integer.htm" title="Integer">integers</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fraction_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Arithmetic fraction">fractions</a>, and <a href="../../wp/d/Decimal.htm" title="Decimal">decimals</a> (using the decimal place-value system). This study is sometimes known as algorism.</p>
       <p>The difficulty and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led educators to question this curriculum, advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas. One notable movement in this direction was the <!--del_lnk--> New Math of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to teach arithmetic in the spirit of axiomatic development from set theory, an echo of the prevailing trend in higher mathematics.</p>
