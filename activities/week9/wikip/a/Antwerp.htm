Antwerp's total population is 507,007 (as of 31 December 2011), making it the largest municipality in both Flanders and Belgium in terms of its population. Its total area is 204.51&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (78.96&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), giving a population density of 2,308 inhabitants per km&sup2;. The <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area, including the outer commuter zone, covers an area of 1,449&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (559&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) with a total of 1,190,769 inhabitants as of 1 January 2008. The inhabitants of Antwerp are locally nicknamed <i>Sinjoren</i>, after the Spanish honorific <i>se&ntilde;or</i>. It refers to the leading <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> noblemen who ruled the city during the 17th century.</p>
       <p>Antwerp has long been an important city in the <!--del_lnk--> Low Countries both economically and culturally, especially before the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Fury (1576) in the period of the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Revolt. It is located on the right (eastern) bank of the river <!--del_lnk--> Scheldt, which is linked to the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> by the estuary <!--del_lnk--> Westerschelde. The city has one of the largest <!--del_lnk--> seaports in Europe.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin_of_the_name">Origin of the name</span></h3>
       <p>According to <a href="../../wp/f/Folklore.htm" title="Folklore">folklore</a>, and as celebrated by the <!--del_lnk--> statue in front of the <!--del_lnk--> town hall, the city got its name from a <!--del_lnk--> legend involving a mythical <!--del_lnk--> giant called <!--del_lnk--> <i>Antigoon</i> who lived near the river <!--del_lnk--> Scheldt. He exacted a toll from those crossing the river, and for those who refused, he severed one of their hands and threw it into the river Scheldt. Eventually, the giant was slain by a young hero named <!--del_lnk--> <i>Brabo</i>, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. Hence the name <i>Antwerpen</i>, from <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> <i>hand werpen</i>&mdash;akin to Old English <i>hand</i> and <i>wearpan</i> (= to throw), which has changed to today's <i>warp</i>.</p>
       <p>In favour of this <!--del_lnk--> folk etymology is the fact that hand-cutting was indeed practised in Europe, the right hand of a man who died without issue being cut off and sent to the feudal lord as proof of <i>main-morte</i>. However, <!--del_lnk--> John Lothrop Motley argues that Antwerp's name derives from <i>an 't werf</i> (on the wharf). <i>Aan 't werp</i> (at the warp) is also possible. This 'warp' (thrown ground) would be a man-made hill, just high enough to remain dry at high tide, whereupon a farm would be built. Another word for werp is <i>pol</i> (hence <!--del_lnk--> polders).</p>
       <p>The prevalent theory is that the name originated in the Gallo-Roman period and comes from the Latin <i>antverpia</i>. <i>Antverpia</i> would come from <i>Ante</i> (before) <i>Verpia</i> (deposition, sedimentation), indicating land that forms by deposition in the inside curve of a river (which is in fact the same origin as Germanic <i>waerpen</i>). Note that the river Scheldt, before a transition period between 600 to 750, followed a different track. This must have coincided roughly with the current ringway south of the city, situating the city within a former curve of the river.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pre-1500">Pre-1500</span></h3>
       <p>Historical Antwerp had its origins in a Gallo-Roman <i><!--del_lnk--> vicus</i> civilization. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952&ndash;1961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century.</p>
       <p>In the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the <!--del_lnk--> Germanic <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a>. The name was reputed to have been derived from "<i>anda"</i> (at) and <i>"werpum"</i> (wharf).</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Merovingian Antwerp, now fortified, was evangelized by <!--del_lnk--> Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. Antwerp became a <!--del_lnk--> margraviate, a border province facing the <!--del_lnk--> County of Flanders.</p>
       <p>In the 11th century <!--del_lnk--> Godfrey of Bouillon was for some years known as the <!--del_lnk--> marquis of Antwerp. In the 12th century, <!--del_lnk--> Norbert of Xanten established a community of his <!--del_lnk--> Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_III_of_England.htm" title="Edward III of England">Edward III</a> during his early negotiations with <!--del_lnk--> Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the <!--del_lnk--> earl of Cambridge, was born there in 1338.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="16th_century">16th century</span></h3>
       <p>After the silting up of the <!--del_lnk--> Zwin and the consequent decline of <!--del_lnk--> Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Brabant, gained in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the English nation is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing product from Portuguese and Spanish plantations. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers did a large business loaning money to the English government in the 1544&ndash;1574 period. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s the city's banking business declined; England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became "the centre of the <i>entire</i> international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height." Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's <!--del_lnk--> golden age is tightly linked to the "<a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Discovery.htm" title="Age of Discovery">Age of Exploration</a>". Over the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the <!--del_lnk--> Alps by 1560. Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. <!--del_lnk--> Francesco Guicciardini, the Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with <a href="../../wp/b/Black_pepper.htm" title="Black pepper">pepper</a> and <!--del_lnk--> cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier "It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the <!--del_lnk--> Americas."</p>
       <p>Without a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from <!--del_lnk--> Venice, <!--del_lnk--> Ragusa, Spain and Portugal. Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large orthodox Jewish community. Antwerp was not a "free" city though, since it had been reabsorbed into the Duchy of Brabant in 1406 and was controlled from <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>.</p>
       <p>Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: The first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from <!--del_lnk--> Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers. In the century after 1541, however, the city's economy and population declined dramatically, while rival Amsterdam experienced massive growth.</p>
       <p>The religious revolution of the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the <!--del_lnk--> Low Countries. The regent <!--del_lnk--> Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when <a href="../../wp/p/Philip_II_of_Spain.htm" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II</a> sent the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the <!--del_lnk--> Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of <!--del_lnk--> Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers plundered the city. During the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Fury 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over 2 million sterling of damage was done.</p>
       <p>Antwerp became the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch revolt. In 1585, <!--del_lnk--> Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a <!--del_lnk--> long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its <!--del_lnk--> Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the <!--del_lnk--> United Provinces in the north, starting the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by <a href="../../wp/g/Genoa.htm" title="Genoa">Genoa</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> became the new trading centre.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The recognition of the independence of the <!--del_lnk--> United Provinces by the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of M&uuml;nster in 1648 stipulated that the <!--del_lnk--> Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point of its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk under 40,000, when <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Napoleon.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon</a>, realising its strategic importance, assigned two million to enlarge the harbour by constructing two docks and a mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter London's harbour and stint British growth, but he was defeated at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Waterloo.htm" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> before he could see the plan through.</p>
       <p>In 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General <!--del_lnk--> David Hendrik Chass&eacute;. For a time Chass&eacute; subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by a French army. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass&eacute; made an honourable surrender.</p>
       <p>Later that century, a ring of fortresses was constructed some 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in the last decade Antwerp presented itself to the world via a <!--del_lnk--> World's Fair attended by 3 million.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_Century">20th Century</span></h3>
       <p>Antwerp was the first city to host the <!--del_lnk--> World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the city became the fall-back point of the <!--del_lnk--> Belgian Army after the defeat at <!--del_lnk--> Li&egrave;ge. The <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.</p>
       <p>Antwerp hosted the <!--del_lnk--> 1920 Summer Olympics. During World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the <!--del_lnk--> British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the <!--del_lnk--> Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of <!--del_lnk--> V-1 and <!--del_lnk--> V-2 missiles battered the city. The city was hit by more V-2s than all other targets during the entire war combined, but the attack did not succeed in destroying the port since many of the missiles fell upon other parts of the city. As a result, the city itself was severely damaged and rebuilt after the war in a modern style. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of <!--del_lnk--> Haredi (and particularly <!--del_lnk--> Hasidic) <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox Judaism.</p>
       <p>Ryckewaert argued for the importance of the Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956&ndash;1965). It expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure over a 10-year period, with national funding, intended to build a set of canal docks. The broader importance was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry. Extending the linear layout along the Scheldt River, planners designed further urbanization along the same linear city model. Satellite communities would be connected to the main strip. Ryckewaert, argues that in contrast to the more confused Europoort plan for the port of <a href="../../wp/r/Rotterdam.htm" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, the Antwerp approach succeeded because of flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties.</p>
       <p>Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp successfully re-branded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasising the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organised tourism and mega-cultural events.</p>

       <p>Although Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, nothing remains of the former <!--del_lnk--> enceinte or of the old <!--del_lnk--> citadel defended by <!--del_lnk--> General Chass&eacute; in 1832, except for the <i><!--del_lnk--> Steen</i>, which has been restored. Modern Antwerp's broad avenues mark the position of the original fortifications. After the establishment of Belgian independence, Antwerp was defended by the citadel and an enceinte around the city. In 1859, seventeen of the twenty-two fortresses constructed under <a href="../../wp/a/Arthur_Wellesley%252C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington.htm" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Wellington</a>'s supervision in 1815&ndash;1818 were dismantled and the old citadel and enceinte were removed. A new enceinte 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) long was constructed, and the villages of <!--del_lnk--> Berchem and <!--del_lnk--> Borgerhout, now boroughs of Antwerp, were absorbed within the city.</p>
       <p>This enceinte is protected by a broad wet ditch, and in the <!--del_lnk--> caponiers are the magazines and store chambers of the fortress. The enceinte has nineteen openings or gateways, but of these seven are not used by the public. As soon as the enceinte was finished eight detached forts from 2 to 2&nbsp;&frac12; miles from the enceinte were constructed. They begin on the north near <!--del_lnk--> Wijnegem and the zone of inundation, and terminate on the south at <!--del_lnk--> Hoboken. In 1870 Fort <!--del_lnk--> Merksem and the redoubts of <!--del_lnk--> Berendrecht and <!--del_lnk--> Oorderen were built for the defence of the area to be inundated north of Antwerp.</p>
       <p>In the 1870s, the fortifications of Antwerp were deemed to be out of date, given the increased range and power of artillery and explosives. Antwerp was transformed into a fortified position by constructing an outer line of forts and batteries 6 to 9 miles (14&nbsp;km) from the enceinte.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
       <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA), the <!--del_lnk--> port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) <!--del_lnk--> port in the world in 2005 and second only to <!--del_lnk--> Rotterdam in Europe. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive <!--del_lnk--> general and <!--del_lnk--> project cargo, as well as <!--del_lnk--> bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five <a href="../../wp/o/Oil_refinery.htm" title="Oil refinery">oil refineries</a>, are home to a massive concentration of <!--del_lnk--> petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in <a href="../../wp/h/Houston.htm" title="Houston">Houston</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Texas. <!--del_lnk--> Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_power.htm" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> plants at <!--del_lnk--> Doel, a <!--del_lnk--> conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller <!--del_lnk--> combined cycle plants. There are plans for a <!--del_lnk--> wind farm in a disused area of the docklands.</p>
       <p>The old Belgian <!--del_lnk--> bluestone <!--del_lnk--> quays bordering the <!--del_lnk--> Scheldt for a distance of 3.5 miles (5.6&nbsp;km) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by <!--del_lnk--> cruise ships and short-sea shipping.</p>
       <p>Antwerp's other great mainstay is the <a href="../../wp/d/Diamond.htm" title="Diamond">diamond</a> trade that takes place largely within the <!--del_lnk--> diamond district. The city has four <a href="../../wp/d/Diamond.htm#Distribution" title="Diamond">diamond bourses</a>: one for <!--del_lnk--> bort and three for gem quality goods. Since World War II families of the large <!--del_lnk--> Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen <!--del_lnk--> Indian traders become increasingly important. Antwerp World Diamond Centre, the successor to the <i>Hoge Raad voor Diamant</i>, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as a centre of the diamond industry.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> VLM Airlines has its head office on the grounds of <!--del_lnk--> Antwerp International Airport in <!--del_lnk--> Deurne, Antwerp; the office is also <!--del_lnk--> CityJet's Antwerp office.

Known locally as the "Ring" it offers motorway connections to <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Hasselt and <!--del_lnk--> Li&egrave;ge, <!--del_lnk--> Ghent, <a href="../../wp/l/Lille.htm" title="Lille">Lille</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Bruges and <!--del_lnk--> Breda and <!--del_lnk--> Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road <!--del_lnk--> tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the <!--del_lnk--> Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the <!--del_lnk--> Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991). Daily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high volume highway link called the "<!--del_lnk--> Oosterweelconnection" being proposed. It would entail the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the <i>Lange Wapper</i>) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination of a widening of the existing motorway into a 14 lane motorway. Eventually the plans were rejected in a public referendum in 2009, thus causing further delays. In September 2010 the <!--del_lnk--> Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialised.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Antwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi via <!--del_lnk--> Luttre, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> and Paris, and national trains to <!--del_lnk--> Ghent, <!--del_lnk--> Bruges, <!--del_lnk--> Ostend, <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Charleroi, <!--del_lnk--> Hasselt, <!--del_lnk--> Li&egrave;ge, <!--del_lnk--> Leuven and <!--del_lnk--> Turnhout.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Antwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in <!--del_lnk--> W G Sebald's haunting novel <!--del_lnk--> <i>Austerlitz</i>. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2&nbsp;km to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.</p>
       <p>Antwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest <!--del_lnk--> classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="City_transportation">City transportation</span></h3>
       <p>The city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by <!--del_lnk--> De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The <!--del_lnk--> tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the "<!--del_lnk--> premetro" and includes a tunnel under the river.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Air">Air</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Antwerp International Airport is in the district of <!--del_lnk--> Deurne. CityJet flies to London (City Airport) and <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> in England and remains the only airline with scheduled air services to and from Antwerp International Airport. The airport is connected by bus to the city centre. <!--del_lnk--> Brussels Airport is about 45&nbsp;km from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. The airport is connected by bus and by train to the city centre of Antwerp. The new Diabolo rail connection will provide a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport starting from Summer 2012. There is also direct a rail service between Antwerp and <!--del_lnk--> Charleroi, home to <!--del_lnk--> Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs every hour.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Former_mayors">Former mayors</span></h3>
       <p>In the early years after the Belgian independence, Antwerp was gouverned by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (with the exception of the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert. From 1932 onwards (and up till 2013) all mayors were belonging to the <!--del_lnk--> Social Democrat party: <!--del_lnk--> Camille Huysmans, <!--del_lnk--> Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti&egrave;ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti&egrave;ge en <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Janssens. Since 2013 the mayor is the Flemish nationalist <!--del_lnk--> Bart De Wever, belonging to the <!--del_lnk--> Flemish separatist party <!--del_lnk--> N-VA (<!--del_lnk--> New Flemish Alliance).</p>

       <p>Antwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its <!--del_lnk--> school of painting, which included <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_Paul_Rubens.htm" title="Peter Paul Rubens">Rubens</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Anthony_van_Dyck.htm" title="Anthony van Dyck">Van Dyck</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Jordaens, the two <!--del_lnk--> Teniers and many others.</p>
       <p>Informally, most Antverpians (in Dutch <i>Antwerpenaren</i>, people from Antwerp) daily speak Antverpian (in Dutch <i>Antwerps</i>), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Brabantian_dialect.htm" title="Brabantian">Brabantic</a> dialects through its typical vowel pronunciations: approximating the vowel sound in 'bore'&mdash; for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the vowel sound in 'hat'. The <i>Echt Antwaarps Teater</i> ("Authentic Antverpian Theatre") brings the dialect on stage.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fashion">Fashion</span></h3>
       <p>Antwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the <!--del_lnk--> Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in Europe. It has served as the learning centre for a large number of Belgian <!--del_lnk--> fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Local_products">Local products</span></h3>
       <p>Antwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bollekesfeest</i> takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as beer from the <!--del_lnk--> De Koninck Brewery, better known in Antwerp as a "<i>Bolleke</i>", an amber-coloured beer. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Mokatine</i> sweets made by <i><!--del_lnk--> Confiserie Roodthooft</i>, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from <i>Koffie Verheyen</i>, sugar from <i>Candico</i>, <i>Poolster</i> pickled herring and <i>Equinox</i> horse meat, are other examples of local specialties. One of the most known products of the city, are its biscuits, the <i>Antwerpse Handjes</i>, literally "Antwerp Hands". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolise the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit making organisation, <i>Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw</i>.</p>
