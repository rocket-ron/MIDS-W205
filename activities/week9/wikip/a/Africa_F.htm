<h2>Northern Africa</h2>
<h3>Algeria</h3>
<p>Following a major earthquake in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/a/Algeria_A.htm">Algeria</a></strong> in 1980, SOS Children offered to build a community
 to help victims of the catastrophe, for which the government provided 
the land. In 1984, a new agreement was signed between the Algerian 
government and SOS Children which led to the construction of an SOS Children's Village in Draria, a suburb of Algiers.&nbsp; It was completed in 1990.</p>
<div>
<h3>Egypt</h3>
<p>There are currently three SOS Children's Villages in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/e/Egypt_B.htm">Egypt</a></strong>.&nbsp; All are located near to the densely populated Nile Delta to the north of the country.</p>
<h3>Morocco</h3>
<p>We began working in <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/m/Morocco_B.htm">Morocco</a></strong> in 1985 when the first SOS Children's Village was established at Ait-Ourir, about 40 km from Marrakesh at the foot of the Atlas Mountains. There are now five SOS Children's Villages in Morocco.</p>
<h3>Tunisia</h3>
SOS Children has three communities in <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/t/Tunisia_B.htm">Tunisia</a></strong>. We opened our first SOS Children's Village in Siliana in 1983.</div>
<h2>Sub-Saharan Africa<br /></h2>
<div>
<h3>Angola</h3>
<p>SOS Children began its work in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/a/Angola_B.htm">Angola</a></strong>
 in 1994 with the construction of 
an SOS Children's Village in the southern town of Lubango. At the same time, we
 set up a wide-reaching vaccination programme against meningitis, an 
illness from which hundreds of children were dying.</p>
<h3>
<img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_MZImage_preview" alt="Children from Cape Town, South Africa" height="374" width="250" />Benin</h3>
<p>The acute need for care facilities for orphaned and abandoned 
children led to the construction of our first SOS Children's Village in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/b/Benin_B.htm">Benin</a></strong> in 1987 at Abomey-Calavi.</p>
<h3>Botswana</h3>
<p>In <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/b/Botswana_A.htm">Botswana</a></strong>, there are three SOS Children's Villages. The most recent SOS Children's Village is in Serowe, about 250km 
north east of the capital Gabarone.  There are 12 family homes for 120 orphaned 
and abandoned children and an SOS Nursery.</p>
<h3>Burkina Faso</h3>
<p>The small republic of <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/b/Burkina_Faso_B.htm">Burkina Faso</a></strong> in West Africa is one of the poorest countries in the world. Negotiations between the government and our charity to build an SOS 
Children's Village in Burkina Faso began in the 1980s, but due to 
political unrest it was not until 1997 that the first children moved 
into the Village in the small community of Polosgo, 10 km north of the 
capital city, Ouagadougou.</p>
<h3>Burundi</h3>
<p>In <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/b/Burundi_D.htm">Burundi</a></strong>, A lack of basic social services and limited economic opportunities mean 
most of the people are subject to continuing disease, trauma and 
displacement. The fifth SOS Children&#x2019;s Village opened in 2009 in Cibitoke.</p>
<h3>Cameroon</h3>
<p>SOS Children currently run two SOS Children's Villages in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/c/Cameroon_D.htm">Cameroon</a></strong>.&nbsp; One is near the capital Yaound&#xE9;, the other is in the coastal town of Douala.</p>
<h3>Cape Verde</h3>
<p>At present there are two SOS Children's Villages in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/c/Cape_Verde_C.htm">Cape Verde</a></strong>, in Assomada and Sao Domingos.</p>
<h3><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_AAPImage_preview" alt="Children from Port Elizabeth, South Africa" height="375" width="250" />Central African Republic</h3>
<p>Due to the increasing need for our work a second SOS Children&#x2019;s Village opened in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/c/Central_African_Republic_B.htm">Central African Republic (CAR)</a></strong> in 2009. SOS Children&#x2019;s Village Bouar in western CAR has 12 family houses for 120 children.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Chad</h3>
<p>
As a response to the crisis in Darfur, Sudan, SOS Children ran an Emergency Relief Programme in Bahai in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/c/Chad_B.htm">Chad</a></strong>,
 to
 support children and families. SOS Children provides psycho-social 
support to children, who are often traumatized by their experiences. 
There is also an SOS Children's Village in the capital N'Djamena.</p>
<h3>Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)</h3>
<p>In <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/c/Congo_C.htm">Democratic Republic of Congo</a></strong> we help children in three SOS Children's Villages. Bukavu and Uvira are in the east of the country, near the border, and there is a village in Kinshasa, the capital.</p>
<h3>C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</h3>
<p>In <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/c/Cote_Divoire.htm">Ivory Coast</a></strong>,
 about 7% of the adult population is affected by HIV/AIDS and about 
one-third of all orphans - 310,000 - have become orphans as a result of 
HIV/AIDS. We currently run two SOS Children's Villages in the country.</p>
<h3>Equatorial Guinea</h3>
<p>Despite some wealth from recently discovered oil deposits, in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/e/Equatorial_Guinea_A.htm">Equatorial Guinea</a></strong> most of the population live below the poverty line. There is currently one SOS Children's Village in Bata.</p>
<h3><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_WUImage_preview" alt="SOS Nursery School Cape Town South Africa" height="312" width="250" />Ethiopia</h3>
<p>Thousands of children in <a title="Sponsor a child in Ethiopia" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia_A.htm"><strong>Ethiopia</strong></a> have been orphaned or abandoned due to HIV/AIDS. We currently run seven SOS Children's 
Villages in the country, alongside Family Strengthening Programmes, SOS Schools and 
SOS Medical Centres.</p>
<h3>Gambia, The</h3>
<p>Supporters from the UK funded the construction of SOS Children's Village Basse, in the <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/g/Gambia_B.htm">Gambia</a></strong>.&nbsp; Outside of Basse, there is an SOS Children's Village in Bakoteh, near the capital Banjul.</p>
<h3>Ghana</h3>
<p>In <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/g/Ghana_C.htm">Ghana</a></strong>,
 we run a special International College in Tema, which provides 
qualifications including the International Baccalaureate to youngsters 
from around Africa, including non-SOS children.&nbsp; Furthermore, there are four SOS Children's Villages in the south of the country.</p>
<h3>Guinea</h3>
<p><strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/g/Guinea_C.htm">Guinea</a></strong>
 in south-west Africa is among the poorest countries on the African 
continent, with very weak human resources and low social development. A 
third SOS Children's Village, together with an SOS Nursery and a SOS Primary School, 
opened in Kankan,
 the country's second biggest city,
 in 2005.  It has twelve family houses which are home to 120 children.</p>
<h3>Guinea Bissau</h3>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/g/Guinea_Bissau.htm">Guinea Bissau</a></strong> is one of the poorest countries in the world. Health conditions and 
rates of infant mortality, life expectancy and literacy are poor even by
 West African standards. We have two SOS Children's Villages in the country, including one in the capital Bissau.</p>
<h3><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_ZImage_preview" alt="Children from Bambous, Mauritius" height="375" width="250" />Kenya</h3>
<p>At present we support over 6,500 people in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/k/Kenya_B.htm">Kenya</a></strong> through our SOS Children's Villages and other work. We provide healthcare, education and community support to those in need.</p>
<h3>Lesotho</h3>
<p>SOS Children has been working in <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/l/Lesotho_A.htm">Lesotho</a></strong> since 1992 when construction started on the SOS Children&#x2019;s Village in the capital, Maseru.
 Completion was delayed by political unrest and fighting between rival 
army factions, and the Village finally opened in 1994.&nbsp; A second Village
 opened in Quthing in 2010.</p>
<h3>Liberia</h3>
<p>According to UNICEF, the rate of prevalence of HIV/AIDS
 among the adult population of <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/l/Liberia_D.htm">Liberia</a></strong>
 is 6%.  There
 are estimated to be over 36,000 orphans as a result of HIV/AIDS. SOS Children in Liberia has developed Family
 Strengthening Programmes to help prevent abandonment.  The SOS Social 
Centre
 and the SOS Medical Centre in Monrovia work to support over 11,500 
vulnerable children and their families in the Greater Monrovia area.</p>
<h3>Madagascar</h3>
<p> In <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/m/Madagascar_B.htm">Madagascar</a></strong>,
 a high annual population growth rate and subsequent migration of people from 
rural areas in search of employment has increased the problems in urban 
areas. There has been a growth of large slum areas where many children live on 
the streets. There are currently three SOS Children's Villages in the 
country.</p>
<h3>Malawi</h3>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/m/Malawi_B.htm">Malawi</a></strong> is one of the ten poorest countries in the world: more than a third 
of the population are illiterate and life expectancy is around 47 years,
 with a high rate of infant mortality.&nbsp; Three SOS Children's Villages, Lilongwe, Blantyre and Mzuzu, run in the country.</p>
<h3><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_BAIImage_preview" alt="Children from Maputo, Mozambique" height="375" width="250" />Mali</h3>
<p>In 2003/2004 regions of <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/m/Mali_B.htm">Mali</a></strong>
 faced famine as a result of poor crop yields and locust 
invasions. The employees of SOS Children's Village Mopti distributed 
basic foodstuffs and other relief
 goods (90 tons of millet, 3 tons of milk, 400 cartons of biscuits, 25 
tons of fodder and 17 tons of seeds) to 570 families with 2,200 children
 in 16 villages to help them. SOS Children's Villages Mopti and Sanankoroba are in the country.</p>
<h3>Mauritius</h3>
<p>The island of <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/m/Mauritius_A.htm">Mauritius</a></strong> is in the Indian Ocean, about 800km east of the island of <a class="internal" href="../../wp/m/Madagascar_B.htm">Madagascar</a>, off the coast of East Africa.
 A former British colony, it became independent in 1968. It is one of 
the most densely populated countries in the world with 585 inhabitants 
per square kilometre. There are two SOS Children's Villages: Beau Bassin and Bambous.</p>
<h3>Mozambique</h3>
<p>Since the Civil War in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/m/Mozambique_C.htm">Mozambique</a></strong>, the country has recovered somewhat.&nbsp; However, the benefits of the economic recovery are available to only a few and 80
 per cent of the population continues to live in absolute poverty.</p>
<h3>Namibia</h3>
<p>We began our work in <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/n/Namibia_B.htm">Namibia</a></strong> in 1985 when the first SOS Children's Village was built on the outskirts of Windhoek on the banks of the Arebush River. A second village was later opened in Tsumeb.</p>
<h3>Niger</h3>
<p>In March 2010, an<a title="SOS Children launches emergency relief programme in Niger to protect 10,000 children from famine" class="internal-link" href="http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/archive/2010/03/sos-children-launches-emergency-relief-programme-in-niger-to-protect-10-000-children-from-famine"> Emergency Relief Programme</a>
 was set up in Tahoua to help relieve the suffering caused by the long 
term famine in <a title="Sponsor a child in Niger" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/n/Niger_D.htm"><strong>Niger</strong></a>. About 9,000 children, many of them orphans, benefited from the distribution of food supplies and the medical treatment
 of conditions caused by malnourishment. A third SOS Children's Village opened in Dosso<strong> </strong>in 2010.</p>
<h3><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_AZCImage_preview" alt="SC Awassa Ethiopia" height="333" width="250" />Nigeria</h3>
<p>There are four SOS Children's Villages in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/n/Nigeria_B.htm">Nigeria</a></strong> caring for children across the country.</p>
<h3>Rwanda</h3>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/r/Rwanda_D.htm">Rwanda</a></strong>
 is still recovering from the genocide in the 1990s.&nbsp; SOS Children has 
been working in the country since before the civil war.&nbsp; There are four SOS 
Children's Villages in the country.</p>
<h3>Senegal</h3>
<p>In <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Senegal_D.htm">Senegal</a></strong>
 there are four SOS Children's Villages. In
 August 2005 heavy rainfall caused devastating flooding in Dakar and 
Kaolack. SOS Children cooperated with the 
government to start an Emergency Relief Programme and provided the affected families with basic food, medicine,
 mattresses, mosquito nets etc. This programme ended in
 December 2005 having supported 1,130 children in 326 families.</p>
<h3>Sierra Leone</h3>
<p>We started our work in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sierra_Leone_A.htm">Sierra Leone</a></strong> in 1974 when SOS Children's Village Freetown opened on the edge of the city.&nbsp; Since then, civil war has 
threatened the country's stability. The situation is getting better, and
 there are now three SOS Children's Villages in the country.</p>
<h3>Somalia</h3>
<p>Since 1985 we have had a continued presence in Mogadishu and maintained 
our operations (with some temporary closures) throughout the civil war 
until the present day. In <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Somalia_E.htm">Somalia</a></strong>, we have also maintained a good relationship with 
UN agencies, international NGOs, local authorities, community
 elders and leaders in the project area and we have constructive 
partnerships with ECHO (EU Humanitarian Office), UNICEF, the World 
Health Organisation and the World Food Programme.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Somaliland</strong></h3>
<p>We have been working in <strong><a title="Sponsor a child in Somaliland" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/s/Somaliland_A.htm">Somaliland</a></strong> since 1999.&nbsp; There is currently one SOS Children's Village in the autonomous region, in Hargeisa, and one SOS Secondary School.&nbsp; There are also two SOS Medical Centres and one SOS Social Centre.</p>
<div>
<h3><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_DUImage_preview" alt="Children from Blantyre, Malawi" height="383" width="250" />South Africa</h3>
<p>Our charity has been active in <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/South_Africa_A.htm">South Africa</a></strong> since the early 1980s when our first SOS Children&#x2019;s Village opened in Ennerdale.</p>
<p>As part of <a class="internal" href="http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/archive/world-cup-football-in-south-africa-charity-news/sos-world-cup-charity-partner-2006/six-villages">&#x201C;6 villages for 2006&#x201D;</a>, SOS Children&#x2019;s joint 2006 World Cup campaign with FIFA, an eighth village was opened in late 2006 in Rustenburg. One of the houses was funded by Tottenham Hotspurs FC.</p>
<p>South Africa, like many African countries, is strongly affected by HIV/AIDS.
 Community outreach programmes have been established at all eight SOS 
Children's Villages to provide practical support and aid for children 
and families in the neighbourhood.</p>
</div>
<h3>South Sudan</h3>
<p><strong><a title="Sponsor a child in South Sudan" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/s/South_Sudan_A.htm">South Sudan</a></strong> became independent from Sudan in 2011. There is one SOS Children's Village in South Sudan, in Malakal. This Children's Village opened in 2002.</p>
<div>
<h3>Sudan, The</h3>
<p>Despite the signing of a peace deal in 2005, the 
conflict, unrest and suffering in <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sudan_C.htm"><strong>Sudan</strong> </a>continues. SOS Children has been
 active in Sudan since 1978 and continues to support refugees, child 
soldiers and families affected by the conflict.&nbsp; There is one SOS Children's Village in the country.<em><strong><em><strong><em><br /></em></strong></em></strong></em></p>
<h3>Swaziland</h3>
<p>There are three SOS Children's Villages in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Swaziland_B.htm">Swaziland</a></strong>. In 2001 SOS Children developed a community based 
child care and support programme for families in Mbabane and since April
 2002, a food programme has been running in the province of Hluthi in 
the vicinity of the SOS Children's Village Nhlangano. The third SOS Children's Village opened in Siteki in 2010.</p>
<h3>Tanzania</h3>
<p>The United Republic of <strong><a class="internal" href="../../wp/t/Tanzania_B.htm">Tanzania</a></strong>
 is one of the few countries in the conflict-ridden Great Lakes Region 
that continues to enjoy uninterrupted peace, but its socio-economic 
development is being threatened by HIV/AIDS. Our third SOS Children&#x2019;s Village in Tanzania opened in Dar Es Salaam in 2006.&nbsp; There is an SOS Children's Village on the island of Zanzibar.</p>
<h3><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_ZPImage_preview" alt="Children from Mahres, Tunisia" height="333" width="250" />Togo</h3>
<p>SOS Children began its work in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/t/Togo_D.htm">Togo</a></strong> during the 1970s when the first SOS Children's Village was built in the capital, Lom&#xE9;. A third Village was opened in Dapaong in 2007.</p>
<h3>Uganda</h3>
<p>Our fourth SOS Children's Village opened in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/u/Uganda_D.htm">Uganda</a></strong> in 2010. We work across the country helping the poorest children.</p>
<h3>Zambia</h3>
<p>In <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/z/Zambia_E.htm">Zambia</a></strong>, our most recent SOS Children's Village opened in Chipata in 2012. Chipata is in the far east of the country near the Malawi
 and Mozambican borders. Over 70% of households in Chipata are caring 
for orphans, and in a large percentage of these already-struggling 
households, HIV/AIDS is a problem.</p>
<h3>Zimbabwe</h3>
<p>
UNICEF estimates that one-fifth (1.3 million) of all children are 
orphans in Zimbabwe, largely because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.&nbsp; More than half of 
all new HIV/AIDS infections are among young people, primarily girls. We have three SOS Children's Villages in <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/z/Zimbabwe_D.htm">Zimbabwe</a></strong> and run several community programmes.</p>
</div>
<h1><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_AAImage_preview" alt="Boy at SOS School Mthatha South Africa" height="250" width="376" />The Story of SOS Child Sponsorship in Africa</h1>
<div>
<p>SOS Children worked in Asia and the Americas before Africa, but our work has grown and become well established in most African countries. In 1971 the opening of an SOS Children's Village in Abobo Gare in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/c/Cote_Divoire.htm">C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</a> marked the beginning of our work in Africa.</p>
<div>
<p>Over the time that SOS Children has been active in Africa, disasters and war have time and time again required a quick reaction to help those most in danger. Sometimes providing emergency relief led SOS Children to begin its activities in a country. Kind donors who contributed to help with the emergencies often become <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/Sponsor_A_Child_B.htm">child sponsors</a> supporting permanent facilities which followed the short-term and medium-term relief efforts.</p>
<p>There have been disasters such as the complete collapse of any state order in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/Somalia_E.htm">Somalia</a>
 at the beginning of the 1990s. SOS Children
 remained in the country throughout the chaos. For a while, SOS Children was the 
only organisation active in the country. As well as an SOS Children's 
Village, where it is still possible to sponsor children, SOS Children 
now runs a well-respected mother and child clinic in Mogadishu.</p>
<p>Other tragedies unfolded in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia_A.htm">Ethiopia</a>, <a class="internal" href="../../wp/m/Mozambique_C.htm">Mozambique</a>, <a class="internal" href="../../wp/a/Angola_B.htm">Angola</a>, the <a class="internal" href="../../wp/c/Congo_C.htm">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> and <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/Sudan_C.htm">Sudan</a>.
 SOS Children is still active in all of these countries. In some cases, 
staff members risked their own lives to protect the children or help 
those in need.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_WNImage_preview" alt="Children at Cape Town, South Africa" height="250" width="375" />In <a class="internal" href="../../wp/r/Rwanda_D.htm">Rwanda</a> nine children and nine staff members could not be saved during the three months of continual genocide in 1994.</p>
<p>In 1999 children, mothers and staff members from SOS Children's Village Bo in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/Sierra_Leone_A.htm">Sierra Leone</a> were repeatedly forced into hiding in order to survive.</p>
<p>In <a class="internal" href="../../wp/l/Liberia_D.htm">Liberia</a>, more than 8,000 people fled to SOS premises near the capital Monrovia in 2003 when fighting broke out.</p>
<p>SOS Children launched an Emergency Relief Programme in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/a/Algeria_A.htm">Algeria</a> following a severe earthquake in May 2003.</p>
<p><a class="internal" href="../../wp/m/Mali_B.htm">Mali</a> faced a problematic food supply situation as a result of poor crop
 yields and locust invasions in the 2003/2004 season. Based in the SOS 
Children's Village in Socoura near Mopti, SOS employees distributed
 food and milk to 570 families with 2,200 children in 16 villages to 
help them get through the crisis.</p>
<p>In 2005 up to a third of <a class="internal" href="../../wp/n/Niger_D.htm">Niger's</a>
 population suffered from food scarcity. Every day children died from 
under nourishment. SOS Children started an Emergency Relief Programme 
for children in danger of dying from acute starvation in the region of 
Tahoua.</p>
<p>SOS Children also focuses on improving the school infrastructure in the catchment area of projects. <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/Sponsor_Africa.htm">Africa</a> has more of our SOS Schools than other continents, but the number of pupils is comparable to that in Asia.</p>
<p>There is a special International College in Tema, <a class="internal" href="../../wp/g/Ghana_C.htm">Ghana</a>, where talented pupils from the whole of Africa
 can gain good qualifications at  College so they can go to University. 
The college focuses on education in pan-African matters, which is 
intended to promote understanding and solidarity between African 
countries.</p>
<p>If there is no local school for the children near to where the SOS Children's 
Village is built, we build one and children from the local community 
can attend it. An example of this  is in the Ouagadougou Village in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/b/Burkina_Faso_B.htm">Burkina Faso</a>,
 where an SOS Nursery was built in September 1997. This nursery is
 very popular with the children in the neighbourhood who attend together
 with the SOS children.</p>
<p>As the SOS children get older, it is important that they have the 
chance to experience living independently. In <a class="internal" href="../../wp/b/Botswana_A.htm">Botswana</a>
 older children move to a '<em>halfway house</em>', an SOS Youth Home, where they are responsible
 for their own shopping, cooking, cleaning, budgeting and school work.&nbsp; Many youths still re-visit their SOS Children's Village to catch up with their SOS mother and other friends.</p>
<p>The children from different SOS Children's Villages in Africa often come together to have fun and make friends. For example in Tema, <a class="internal" href="../../wp/g/Ghana_C.htm">Ghana</a> a total of 750 children and young people from Ghana, <a class="internal" href="../../wp/b/Benin_B.htm">Benin</a> and <a class="internal" href="../../wp/a/Africa_G.htm">Nigeria</a> met up to play a football tournament.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_AQRImage_preview" alt="SOS Social Centre Pietermaritzburg South Africa" height="250" width="376" /></p>
<p>HIV/AIDS represents one of the greatest threats to many African 
countries, particularly those south of the Sahara, which includes 
countries like <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/South_Africa_A.htm">South Africa</a>.
 This is one of the main reasons why in recent years SOS Children has 
been improving and extending its family support, community-based
 projects and social work to care for and protect vulnerable children 
and educate people about the risks of HIV and AIDS.</p>
<p>The fight against HIV/AIDS is a priority at SOS Children's Village Gitega, <a class="internal" href="../../wp/b/Burundi_D.htm">Burundi</a>.
 At the SOS School a '<em>Stop-AIDS Club</em>' was created in 2004 for children aged 
between eleven and twelve. This was designed to teach the children what 
HIV/AIDS is, and also to inform them about means of protection.</p>
<p>There is also awareness raising about another life threatening disease: Malaria. In Bakoteh, in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/g/Gambia_B.htm">the Gambia,</a>
 a representative from the National Malaria Control Programme was 
invited to talk about how malaria 
(a curable and preventable disease) kills more than a million people each year. Most of them are children 
under five.</p>
<p>Along with preventative medicine, we build and staff SOS Medical Centres to directly treat patients. The SOS Medical Centre in Mbalmayo near the capital of Yaound&#xE9; in <a class="internal" href="../../wp/c/Cameroon_D.htm">Cameroon</a>
 is attached to the SOS Children's Village, and provides the population 
with general medical care as well as preventative health counselling.</p>
