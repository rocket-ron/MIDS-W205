It is bordered by the <a href="../../wp/c/Czech_Republic.htm" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> to the north, <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Slovakia.htm" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> to the east, <a href="../../wp/s/Slovenia.htm" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> to the south, and <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Liechtenstein.htm" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> to the west. The territory of Austria covers 83,855 square kilometres (32,377&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and has a <!--del_lnk--> temperate and <!--del_lnk--> alpine climate. Austria's terrain is highly mountainous due to the presence of the <!--del_lnk--> Alps; only 32% of the country is below 500 metres (1,640&nbsp;ft), and its highest point is 3,798 metres (12,461&nbsp;ft). The majority of the population speak local <!--del_lnk--> Bavarian dialects of <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> as their native language, and German in its standard form is the country's official language. Other local official languages are <!--del_lnk--> Hungarian, <!--del_lnk--> Burgenland Croatian, and <!--del_lnk--> Slovene.</p>
       <p>The origins of modern-day Austria date back to the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg dynasty when the vast majority of the country was a part of the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Austria became one of the <!--del_lnk--> great powers of Europe and, in response to the coronation of <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> as the <!--del_lnk--> Emperor of the French, the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1804. In 1867, the empire was <!--del_lnk--> reformed into <a href="../../wp/a/Austria-Hungary.htm" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>.</p>
       <p>After the collapse of the Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian) Empire in 1918 at the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Austria adopted and used the name the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of German-Austria (<i><span lang="de">Deutsch&ouml;sterreich</span></i>, later <i><span lang="de">&Ouml;sterreich</span></i>) in an attempt for union with <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Germany</a>, but was forbidden due to the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). The <!--del_lnk--> First Austrian Republic was established in 1919. In the 1938 <a href="../../wp/a/Anschluss.htm" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>, Austria was occupied and annexed by <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. This lasted until the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> in 1945, after which Germany was <!--del_lnk--> occupied by the Allies and Austria's former democratic constitution was restored. In 1955, the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian State Treaty re-established Austria as a sovereign state, ending the occupation. In the same year, the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian Parliament created the <!--del_lnk--> Declaration of Neutrality which declared that the Second Austrian Republic would become permanently <!--del_lnk--> neutral.</p>
       <p>Today, Austria is a parliamentary <!--del_lnk--> representative democracy comprising nine <!--del_lnk--> federal states. The capital and largest city, with a population exceeding 1.7&nbsp;million, is <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>. Austria is one of the <!--del_lnk--> richest countries in the world, with a nominal per capita GDP of $46,330 (2012 est.). The country has developed a <!--del_lnk--> high standard of living and in 2011 was ranked 19th in the world for its <!--del_lnk--> Human Development Index. Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955, joined the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> in 1995, and is a founder of the <!--del_lnk--> OECD. Austria also signed the <!--del_lnk--> Schengen Agreement in 1995, and adopted the European currency, the <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">euro</a>, in 1999.</p>

The word is circled in red. Modern Austria honours this document, dated 996, as the founding of the nation.</div>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The German name for Austria, <span lang="de"><i>&Ouml;sterreich</i></span>, refers to the meanings "eastern kingdom" or "eastern empire", and it derives from the word <i>Ostarr&icirc;chi</i>, which first appears in the "Ostarr&icirc;chi document" of 996. This word is probably a translation of <!--del_lnk--> Medieval Latin <span lang="la"><i><!--del_lnk--> Marchia orientalis</i></span> into a local (Bavarian) dialect. It was a prefecture of Bavaria created in 976. The word "Austria" is a Latinisation of the German name and was first recorded in the 12th century.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Heer, a 20th-century Austrian historian, stated in his book <i>Der Kampf um die &ouml;sterreichische Identit&auml;t</i> (<i>The Struggle Over Austrian Identity</i>), that the Germanic form <i>Ostarr&icirc;chi</i> was not a translation of the Latin word, but both resulted from a much older term originating in the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic languages of ancient Austria: more than 2,500 years ago, the major part of the actual country was called <i>Norig</i> by the Celtic population (<!--del_lnk--> Hallstatt culture); according to Heer, <i>no-</i> or <i>nor-</i> meant "east" or "eastern", whereas <i>-rig</i> is related to the modern German <i>Reich</i>, meaning "realm". Accordingly, <i>Norig</i> would essentially mean <i>Ostarr&icirc;chi</i> and <i>&Ouml;sterreich</i>, thus <i>Austria</i>. The Celtic name was eventually Latinised to <i><!--del_lnk--> Noricum</i> after the Romans conquered the area that encloses most of modern day Austria, in approximately 15 BC. <i>Noricum</i> later became a <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_province.htm" title="Roman province">Roman province</a> in the mid 1st century AD.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
       <p>Settled in ancient times, the Central European land that is now Austria was occupied in pre-Roman times by various <!--del_lnk--> Celtic tribes. The Celtic kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Noricum was later claimed by the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> and made a province. Present day Petronell-Carnuntum in Eastern Austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the Upper Pannonia province. Fifty thousand people called <!--del_lnk--> Carnuntum home for nearly 400 years.</p>
       <p>After the fall of the Roman Empire the area was invaded by <!--del_lnk--> Bavarians, <a href="../../wp/s/Slavs.htm" title="Slavs">Slavs</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Avars. The Slavic tribe of the Carantanians <!--del_lnk--> migrated into the Alps and established the realm of <!--del_lnk--> Carantania, which covered much of eastern and central Austrian territory. <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> conquered the area in 788 AD, encouraged colonisation and introduced Christianity. As part of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Francia, the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of <!--del_lnk--> Babenberg. The area was known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> marchia Orientalis</i> and was given to <!--del_lnk--> Leopold of Babenberg in 976.</p>
       <p>The first record showing the name Austria is from 996 where it is written as <i><!--del_lnk--> Ostarr&icirc;chi</i>, referring to the territory of the Babenberg March. In 1156 the <!--del_lnk--> Privilegium Minus elevated Austria to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of <!--del_lnk--> Styria. With the death of <!--del_lnk--> Frederick II in 1246, the line of the Babenbergs went extinct.</p>
       <p>As a result <!--del_lnk--> Ottokar II of Bohemia effectively assumed control of the duchies of Austria, Styria and <!--del_lnk--> Carinthia. His reign came to an end with his defeat at <!--del_lnk--> D&uuml;rnkrut at the hands of <!--del_lnk--> Rudolph I of Germany in 1278. Thereafter, until <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the <!--del_lnk--> Habsburgs.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</span></h3>
       <p>In the 14th and 15th centuries, the <!--del_lnk--> Habsburgs began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria. In 1438 Duke <!--del_lnk--> Albert V of Austria was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Sigismund. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The Habsburgs began also to accumulate lands far from the hereditary lands.

His son <!--del_lnk--> Philip the Fair married <!--del_lnk--> Joanna the Mad, the heiress of <!--del_lnk--> Castile and <!--del_lnk--> Aragon, and thus acquired Spain and its Italian, African and <!--del_lnk--> New World appendages for the Habsburgs.</p>
       <p>In 1526 following the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Moh&aacute;cs, <!--del_lnk--> Bohemia and the part of <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> not occupied by the Ottomans came under Austrian rule. <!--del_lnk--> Ottoman expansion into Hungary led to <!--del_lnk--> frequent conflicts between the two empires, particularly evident in the so-called <!--del_lnk--> Long War of 1593 to 1606. The Turks made incursions into <!--del_lnk--> Styria nearly twenty times; burning, pillaging, and taking thousands of slaves.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>During the long reign of <!--del_lnk--> Leopold I (1657&ndash;1705) and following the successful <!--del_lnk--> defense of Vienna in 1683 (under the command of the King of Poland, <!--del_lnk--> John III Sobieski), a <!--del_lnk--> series of campaigns resulted in bringing all of Hungary to Austrian control by the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Emperor Charles VI relinquished many of the fairly impressive gains the empire made in the previous years, largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg. Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for other powers' worthless recognitions of the <!--del_lnk--> Pragmatic Sanction that made his daughter <!--del_lnk--> Maria Theresa his heir. With the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Prussia the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian&ndash;Prussian dualism began in Germany. Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three <!--del_lnk--> Partitions of Poland (in 1772 and 1795).</p>
       <p>Austria later became engaged in a war with <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="Revolutionary France">Revolutionary France</a>, at the beginning highly unsuccessful, with successive defeats at the hands of <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> meaning the end of the old <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> in 1806. Two years earlier, in 1804, the <!--del_lnk--> Empire of Austria was founded.

       <p>It emerged from the <!--del_lnk--> Congress of Vienna in 1815 as one of four of the continent's dominant powers and a recognised <!--del_lnk--> great power. The same year, the <!--del_lnk--> German Confederation, (<span lang="de"><i>Deutscher Bund</i></span>) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political and national conflicts the German lands were shaken by the <!--del_lnk--> 1848 revolution aiming to create a unified Germany.</p>
       <p>A unified Germany would have been possible either as a <!--del_lnk--> Greater Germany, or a Greater Austria or just the German Confederation without Austria at all. As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire of 1848, the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Wilhelm IV. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> and successfully freed the independent duchies of <!--del_lnk--> Schleswig and <!--del_lnk--> Holstein. Nevertheless as they could not agree on a solution to the administration of the two duchies, they fought in 1866 the <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Prussian War. Defeated by Prussia in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz, Austria had to leave the German Confederation and subsequently no longer took part in German politics.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the <i>Ausgleich</i>, provided for a dual sovereignty, the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian Empire and the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Hungary, under <!--del_lnk--> Franz Joseph I. The Austrian-Hungarian rule of this diverse empire included various <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Slavs.htm" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic</a> groups including <!--del_lnk--> Croats, <!--del_lnk--> Czechs, <!--del_lnk--> Poles, <!--del_lnk--> Rusyns, <!--del_lnk--> Serbs, <!--del_lnk--> Slovaks, <!--del_lnk--> Slovenes and <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainians, as well as large Italian and <!--del_lnk--> Romanian communities.</p>
       <p>As a result, ruling Austria&ndash;Hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements, causing a high reliance on the use of an expanded secret police. Yet the government of Austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects: The <i>Reichsgesetzblatt</i>, publishing the laws and ordinances of <!--del_lnk--> Cisleithania, was issued in eight languages, all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices, for example.</p>

       <p>In 1908 Austria-Hungary found an excuse in the promulgation of the <!--del_lnk--> Second Constitutional Era in the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> to annex <!--del_lnk--> Bosnia and Herzegovina. The <!--del_lnk--> assassination of <a href="../../wp/a/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria.htm" title="Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> in <a href="../../wp/s/Sarajevo.htm" title="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> in 1914 by Bosnian Serb <!--del_lnk--> Gavrilo Princip was used by leading Austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on Serbia, thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> which led to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Over one million Austro-Hungarian soldiers died in World War I.</p>
       <p>On 21 October 1918, the elected German members of the <i>Reichsrat</i> (parliament of Imperial Austria) met in Vienna as the Provisional National Assembly for German Austria (<i>Provisorische Nationalversammlung f&uuml;r Deutsch&ouml;sterreich</i>). On 30 October the assembly founded the State of German Austria by appointing a government, called <i>Staatsrat</i>. This new government was invited by the emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with Italy, but refrained from this business.</p>
       <p>This left the responsibility for the end of the war on 3 November 1918, solely to the emperor and his government. On 11 November the emperor, counseled by ministers of the old and the new government, declared he would not take part in state business any more; on 12 November German Austria, by law, declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new German republic. The constitution, renaming <i>Staatsrat</i> to <i>Bundesregierung</i> (federal government) and <i>Nationalversammlung</i> to <i>Nationalrat</i> (national council) was passed on 10 November 1920.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Saint-Germain of 1919 (for Hungary the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Trianon of 1920) confirmed and consolidated the new order of Central Europe which to a great part had been established in November 1918, creating new states and resizing others. Over 3-million German speaking Austrians found themselves living outside of the newborn Austrian Republic as minorities in the newly formed or enlarged respective states of <a href="../../wp/c/Czechoslovakia.htm" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> and Italy. This included the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> South Tyrol and <!--del_lnk--> German Bohemia, the latter of which would play a role in sparking WWII.</p>
       <p>The South Tyrol question would become a lingering problem between Austria and Italy until it was officially settled by the 1980s with a large degree of autonomy being granted by the Italian national government. Between 1918 and 1919 Austria was known as the State of <!--del_lnk--> German Austria (<span lang="de"><i>Staat Deutsch&ouml;sterreich</i></span>). Not only did the <!--del_lnk--> Entente powers forbid German Austria to unite with Germany, they also rejected the name German Austria in the peace treaty to be signed; it was therefore changed to Republic of Austria in late 1919.</p>
       <p>The border between Austria and the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) was settled with the <!--del_lnk--> Carinthian Plebiscite in October 1920 and allocated the major part of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian <!--del_lnk--> Crownland of Carinthia to Austria. This set the border on the <!--del_lnk--> Karawanken mountain range, with many <!--del_lnk--> Slovenes remaining in Austria.</p>
       <p>After the war inflation began to devaluate the <i>Krone</i>, still Austria's currency. In the autumn of 1922 Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>. The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency and improve its general economic condition. With the granting of the loan, Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. In 1925 the <i><!--del_lnk--> Schilling</i>, replacing the <i>Krone</i> by 10,000:1, was introduced. Later it was called the Alpine dollar due to its stability. From 1925 to 1929 the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after Black Friday.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> First Austrian Republic lasted until 1933 when Chancellor <!--del_lnk--> Engelbert Dollfuss, using what he called "self-switch-off of Parliament" (<span lang="de"><i>Selbstausschaltung des Parlaments</i></span>), established an autocratic regime tending toward <!--del_lnk--> Italian fascism. The two big parties at this time, the Social Democrats and the Conservatives, had paramilitary armies; the Social Democrats' <i><!--del_lnk--> Schutzbund</i> was now declared illegal but still operative as <!--del_lnk--> civil war broke out.</p>
       <p>In February 1934 several members of the <i>Schutzbund</i> were executed, the Social Democratic party was outlawed and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated. On 1 May 1934, the <!--del_lnk--> Austrofascists imposed a new constitution ("Maiverfassung") which cemented Dollfuss's power but on 25 July he was assassinated in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> coup attempt.</p>

       <p>His successor, <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Schuschnigg, struggled to keep Austria independent as "the better German state", but on 12 March 1938, Austrian Nazis took over government, while German troops occupied the country. On 13 March 1938, the <i><a href="../../wp/a/Anschluss.htm" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a></i> of Austria was officially declared. Two days later <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a> (an Austrian by birth), announced what he called the "re-unification" of his home country with the "rest of <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Germany</a>" on Vienna's <!--del_lnk--> Heldenplatz. He established a plebiscite confirming the union with Germany in April 1938.</p>
       <p>Parliamentary elections were held in Germany (including recently-annexed Austria) on 10 April 1938. They were the final elections to the Reichstag during Nazi rule and took the form of a single-question referendum asking whether voters approved of a single Nazi-party list for the 813-member Reichstag as well as the recent annexation of Austria (the Anschluss). Turnout in the election was officially 99.5% with 98.9% voting "yes". In the case of Austria, Hitler's native soil, 99.71% of an electorate of 4,484,475 officially went to the ballots, with a positive tally of 99.73%.</p>

       <p>Austria was incorporated into the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> and ceased to exist as an independent country. The <!--del_lnk--> Aryanisation of the wealth of Jewish Austrians started immediately mid-March with a so-called "wild" (i.e. extra-legal) phase but soon was structured legally and bureaucratically to strip Jewish citizens of any asset they may have possessed. The Nazis called Austria "<!--del_lnk--> Ostmark" until 1942 when it was again renamed and called "Alpen-Donau-Reichsgaue".</p>
       <p>Some of the most prominent Nazis were native Austrians, including Hitler, <!--del_lnk--> Adolf Eichmann, <!--del_lnk--> Ernst Kaltenbrunner, <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Seyss-Inquart, <!--del_lnk--> Franz Stangl, and <!--del_lnk--> Odilo Globocnik, as were 40% of the staff at Nazi <!--del_lnk--> extermination camps. Vienna fell on 13 April 1945, during the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> <!--del_lnk--> Vienna Offensive just before the total collapse of the Third Reich. The invading Allied powers, in particular the Americans, planned for the supposed "Alpine Fortress Operation" of national redoubt that was largely to have taken place on Austrian soil in the mountains of the eastern Alps. However it never materialized because of the rapid collapse of the Reich.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Karl Renner and <!--del_lnk--> Adolf Sch&auml;rf (Socialist Party of Austria [Social Democrats and Revolutionary Socialists]), Leopold Kunschak (Austria's People's Party [former Christian Social People's Party]) and Johann Koplenig (Communist Party of Austria) declared Austria's secession from the Third Reich by the Declaration of Independence on 27 April 1945 and set up a <!--del_lnk--> provisional government in Vienna under state Chancellor Renner the same day, with the approval of the victorious <!--del_lnk--> Red Army and backed by <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>. (The date is officially named the birthday of the second republic.) At the end of April, most of Western and Southern Austria still was under Nazi rule. On 1 May 1945, the federal constitution of 1929, which had been terminated by dictator Dollfuss on 1 May 1934, was declared valid again.</p>

       <p>Total <!--del_lnk--> military deaths from 1939 to 1945 are estimated at 260,000. Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 65,000. About 140,000 Jewish Austrians had fled the country in 1938&ndash;39. Thousands of Austrians had taken part in serious Nazi crimes (hundreds of thousands died in <a href="../../wp/m/Mauthausen-Gusen_concentration_camp.htm" title="Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp">Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp</a> only), a fact officially recognised by Chancellor <!--del_lnk--> Franz Vranitzky in 1992.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="After_World_War_II">After World War II</span></h3>
       <p>Much like Germany, Austria was divided into British, French, Soviet and American zones and governed by the <!--del_lnk--> Allied Commission for Austria. As forecast in the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow Declaration in 1943, there was a subtle difference in the treatment of Austria by the Allies. The Austrian government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives and Communists (until 1947), and residing in Vienna, which was surrounded by the Soviet zone, was recognised by the <!--del_lnk--> Western Allies in October 1945 after some doubts that Renner could be Stalin's puppet. Thus the creation of a separate Western Austrian government and the division of the country was avoidable. Austria, in general, was treated as though it had been originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the Allies.</p>
       <p>On 15 May 1955, after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, Austria regained full independence by concluding the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian State Treaty with the Four Occupying Powers. On 26 October 1955, after all occupation troops had left, Austria declared its "permanent neutrality" by an act of parliament.</p>

       <p>The political system of the Second Republic is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reintroduced in 1945. The system came to be characterised by <i><!--del_lnk--> Proporz</i>, meaning that most posts of political importance were split evenly between members of the Social Democrats and the People's Party. Interest group "chambers" with mandatory membership (e.g. for workers, business people, farmers) grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process, so that hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus.</p>
       <p>Since 1945, governing via a single-party government has occurred between 1966&ndash;1970 (Conservatives) and 1970&ndash;1983 (Social Democrats). During all other legislative periods, either a grand coalition of Conservatives and Social Democrats or a "small coalition" (one of these two and a smaller party) ruled the country.</p>
       <p>Following a <!--del_lnk--> referendum in 1994, at which consent reached a majority of two-thirds, the country became a member of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> on 1 January 1995.</p>
       <p>The major parties SP&Ouml; and &Ouml;VP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military non-alignment: While the SP&Ouml; in public supports a neutral role, the &Ouml;VP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some &Ouml;VP politicians. In reality, Austria is taking part in the EU's <!--del_lnk--> Common Foreign and Security Policy, participates in the so-called Petersburg Agenda (including <a href="../../wp/p/Peacekeeping.htm" title="Peacekeeping">peace keeping</a> and peace creating tasks) and has become member of <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a>'s "Partnership for Peace"; the constitution has been amended accordingly. Since <a href="../../wp/l/Liechtenstein.htm" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> joined the <!--del_lnk--> Schengen Area in 2011, none of Austria's neighbouring countries performs border controls towards it anymore.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of Austria is located in <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, the country's largest city and capital. Austria became a federal, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary democracy">parliamentary, democratic</a> republic through the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Constitution of 1920. The political system of the Second Republic with its <!--del_lnk--> nine states is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reenacted on 1 May 1945.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> head of state is the <!--del_lnk--> Federal President (<i>Bundespr&auml;sident</i>), who is directly elected by popular vote. The chairman of the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Government is the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Chancellor, who is appointed by the president. The government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by <!--del_lnk--> vote of no confidence in the lower chamber of parliament, the <!--del_lnk--> Nationalrat. Voting for the federal president and for the Parliament used to be compulsory in Austria, but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004.</p>
       <p>The Parliament of Austria consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor, or by Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years (since 2007) has <!--del_lnk--> voting rights. While there is a general threshold of 4% for all parties at federal elections (Nationalratswahlen), there remains the possibility to gain a direct seat, or <span lang="de"><i>Direktmandat</i></span>, in one of the 43 regional election districts.</p>
       <p>The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the <!--del_lnk--> Bundesrat, has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can&mdash;in almost all cases&mdash;ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time. This is referred to as '<i>Beharrungsbeschluss</i>, lit. "vote of persistence"). A convention, called the <span lang="de"><i>&Ouml;sterreich -Konvent</i></span> was convened on 30 June 2003 to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution, but failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two-thirds of votes in the Nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and/or reform.</p>
       <p>With legislative and executive, the courts are the third column of Austrian state powers. Notably the Constitutional Court (<i>Verfassungsgerichtshof</i>) may exert considerable influence on the political system by ruling out laws and ordinances not in compliance with the constitution. Since 1995, the <!--del_lnk--> European Court of Justice may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the European Union. Austria also implements the decisions of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Court_of_Human_Rights.htm" title="European Court of Human Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a>, since the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights.htm" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> is part of the Austrian constitution.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_developments">Recent developments</span></h3>
       <p>After general elections held in October 2006, the <!--del_lnk--> Social Democrats emerged as the largest party, whereas the <!--del_lnk--> People's Party lost about 8% in votes. Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007 the People's Party and Social Democrats formed a grand coalition with the social democrat <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Gusenbauer as Chancellor. This coalition broke up in June 2008. Elections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (Social Democrats and People's Party) but together they still held more than 50% of the votes with the Social Democrats holding the majority. They formed a coalition with Werner Faymann from the Social Democrats as Chancellor. The positions of the Freedom Party and the deceased <!--del_lnk--> J&ouml;rg Haider's new party <!--del_lnk--> Alliance for the Future of Austria, both parties on the political right, were strengthened during the election.</p>

       <p>The 1955 <!--del_lnk--> Austrian State Treaty ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Assembly passed a constitutional article in which "Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality". The second section of this law stated that "in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.</p>
       <p>Austria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">the Soviet Union</a>, granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> in 1991, and, since 1995, it has developed participation in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">EU's</a> Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Also in 1995, it joined <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> Partnership for Peace and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still valid fully is not to allow foreign military bases in Austria.</p>
       <p>Austria attaches great importance to participation in the <!--del_lnk--> Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the <!--del_lnk--> Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). As an OSCE participating State, Austria's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Helsinki Commission.</p>

       <p>The manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces (<a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>: <span lang="de"><i>Bundesheer</i></span>) mainly relies on <!--del_lnk--> conscription. All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit have to serve a six months <!--del_lnk--> military service, followed by an eight-year reserve obligation. Both males and females at the age of sixteen are eligible for voluntary service. <!--del_lnk--> Conscientious objection is legally acceptable and those who claim this right are obliged to serve an institutionalised nine months <!--del_lnk--> civilian service instead. Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.</p>
       <p>The main sectors of the Bundesheer are Joint Forces (Streitkr&auml;ftef&uuml;hrungskommando, SKF&uuml;Kdo) which consist of Land Forces (Landstreitkr&auml;fte), Air Forces (Luftstreitkr&auml;fte), International Missions (Internationale Eins&auml;tze) and Special Forces (Spezialeinsatzkr&auml;fte), next to Mission Support (Kommando Einsatzunterst&uuml;tzung; KdoEU) and Command Support (Kommando F&uuml;hrungsunterst&uuml;tzung; KdoF&uuml;U). Austria is a <!--del_lnk--> landlocked country and has no navy.</p>
       <p>In 2004, Austria's defence expenditures corresponded to approximately 0.9% of its GDP. The Army currently has about 45,000 soldiers, of whom about half are conscripts. As head of state, <!--del_lnk--> Austrian President (currently <!--del_lnk--> Heinz Fischer) is nominally the Commander-in-Chief of the Bundesheer. In practical reality, however, command of the Austrian Armed Forces is almost exclusively exercised by the Minister of Defense, currently <!--del_lnk--> Gerald Klug.</p>
       <p>Since the end of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, and more importantly the removal of the former heavily guarded "<a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Curtain.htm" title="Iron Curtain">Iron Curtain</a>" separating Austria and its <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Bloc neighbours (<a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Czechoslovakia.htm" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>), the Austrian military has been assisting Austrian border guards in trying to prevent border crossings by <!--del_lnk--> illegal immigrants. This assistance came to an end when Hungary and <a href="../../wp/s/Slovakia.htm" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> joined the EU <!--del_lnk--> Schengen Area in 2008, for all intents and purposes abolishing "internal" border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_disaster.htm" title="Natural disaster">natural disasters</a>. They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.</p>
       <p>Within its self-declared status of permanent neutrality, Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The <!--del_lnk--> Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit (AFDRU), in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (e.g. rescue dog handlers) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient <!--del_lnk--> SAR unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in <a href="../../wp/b/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.htm" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kosovo.htm" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> and, since 1974, in the <!--del_lnk--> Golan Heights.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Administrative_divisions">Administrative divisions</span></h3>
       <p>As a <!--del_lnk--> federal republic, Austria is divided into <!--del_lnk--> nine states (<a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>: <span lang="de"><i>Bundesl&auml;nder</i></span>). These states are then divided into <!--del_lnk--> districts (<span lang="de"><i><!--del_lnk--> Bezirke</i></span>) and statutory cities (<span lang="de"><i><!--del_lnk--> Statutarst&auml;dte</i></span>). Districts are subdivided into municipalities (<span lang="de"><i>Gemeinden</i></span>). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions but have some legislative authority distinct from the federal government, e.g. in matters of culture, social care, youth and nature protection, hunting, building, and zoning ordinances. In recent years, it has been discussed whether today it is appropriate for a small country to maintain ten parliaments.</p>

       <p>Austria is a largely mountainous country due to its location in the <!--del_lnk--> Alps. The <!--del_lnk--> Central Eastern Alps, <!--del_lnk--> Northern Limestone Alps and <!--del_lnk--> Southern Limestone Alps are all partly in Austria. Of the total area of Austria (84,000 km<sup>2</sup> or 32,433&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below 500 metres (1,640&nbsp;ft). The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.</p>
       <p>Austria lies between latitudes <!--del_lnk--> 46&deg; and <!--del_lnk--> 49&deg; N, and longitudes <!--del_lnk--> 9&deg; and <!--del_lnk--> 18&deg; E.</p>
       <p>It can be divided into five areas, the biggest being the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Alps, which constitute 62% of nation's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the Alps and the <!--del_lnk--> Carpathians account for around 12% and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian <a href="../../wp/g/Granite.htm" title="Granite">granite</a> <!--del_lnk--> plateau, it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the <!--del_lnk--> Vienna basin comprises the remaining 4%.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Phytogeographically, Austria belongs to the Central European province of the <!--del_lnk--> Circumboreal Region within the <!--del_lnk--> Boreal Kingdom.

       <p>Austria is the 12th <!--del_lnk--> richest country in the world in terms of GDP (Gross domestic product) per capita, has a well-developed <!--del_lnk--> social market economy, and a high <!--del_lnk--> standard of living. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, <!--del_lnk--> privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. <!--del_lnk--> Labour movements are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics. Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy.</p>

       <p>Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the <!--del_lnk--> German economy. Since Austria became a member state of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> it has gained closer ties to other EU economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market and proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union. Growth in GDP accelerated in recent years and reached 3.3% in 2006.</p>
       <p>Austria indicated on 16 Nov 2010 that it would withhold the December installment of its contribution to the EU bailout of Greece citing material worsening of the Greek debt situation and apparent inability of Greece to collect the level of tax receipts it had previously promised.</p>
       <p>Since the fall of communism, Austrian companies have been quite active players and consolidators in Eastern Europe. Between 1995 and 2010, 4'868 <!--del_lnk--> mergers &amp; acquisitions with a total known value of 163 bil. EUR with the involvement of Austrian firms have been announced. The largest transactions with involvement of Austrian companies have been: the acquisition of <!--del_lnk--> Bank Austria by <!--del_lnk--> Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank for 7.8 bil. EUR in 2000, the acquisition of <!--del_lnk--> Porsche Holding Salzburg by <!--del_lnk--> Volkswagen Group for 3.6 bil. EUR in 2009, and the acquisition of <!--del_lnk--> Banca Comercial&#x103; Rom&acirc;n&#x103; by <!--del_lnk--> Erste Group for 3.7 bil. EUR in 2005.</p>
       <p>Tourism accounts for almost 9% of the Austrian gross domestic product. In 2007, Austria ranked 9th worldwide in international tourism receipts, with 18.9 billion US$. In <!--del_lnk--> international tourist arrivals, Austria ranked 12th with 20.8 million tourists.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy">Energy</span></h3>
       <p>In 1972, the country began construction of a <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_power.htm" title="Nuclear power">nuclear-powered</a> electricity-generation station at <!--del_lnk--> Zwentendorf on the River <a href="../../wp/d/Danube.htm" title="Danube">Danube</a>, following a unanimous vote in parliament. However, in 1978, a <!--del_lnk--> referendum voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for, and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity.</p>
       <p>Austria currently produces more than half of its electricity by <!--del_lnk--> hydropower. Together with other <a href="../../wp/r/Renewable_energy.htm" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sources such as <!--del_lnk--> wind, <!--del_lnk--> solar and <!--del_lnk--> biomass powerplants, the electricity supply from renewable energy amounts to 62.89% of total use in Austria, with the rest being produced by <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">gas</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a> powerplants.</p>

       <p>Austria's population estimate in April 2011 was 8,414,638. The population of the capital, <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, exceeds 1.7&nbsp;million (2.2&nbsp;million including the suburbs), representing about a quarter of the country's population. It is known for its cultural offerings and high standard of living.</p>
       <p>Vienna is by far the country's largest city. <!--del_lnk--> Graz is second in size, with 250,099 inhabitants, followed by <!--del_lnk--> Linz (188,968), <!--del_lnk--> Salzburg (150,000), and <!--del_lnk--> Innsbruck (117,346). All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
       <p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Eurostat, in 2010 there were 1.27 million foreign-born residents in the Austria, corresponding to 15.2% of the total population. Of these, 764,000 (9.1%) were born outside the EU and 512,000 (6.1%) were born in another EU Member State.</p>
       <p>As of 2011, Statistik Austria official estimates have shown that 81% or 6.75 million residents had no migration background and more than 19% or 1.6 million inhabitants had at least one or more parents of migration background. There are more than 415,000 descendants of foreign born immigrants residing in Austria, the great majority of whom have been naturalized.</p>
       <p>350,000&ndash;400,000 <!--del_lnk--> Turks (including a minority of Turkish <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/k/Kurdish_people.htm" title="Kurds">Kurds</a>) compose 4% of the total population, and make up today the biggest single ethnic minority in Austria. 13,000 Turks were naturalized in 2003 and an unknown number have arrived in Austria at the same time. While 2,000 Turks left Austria in the same year, 10,000 immigrated to the country, confirming a strong trend of growth. Together, <!--del_lnk--> Serbs, <!--del_lnk--> Croats, <!--del_lnk--> Bosniaks and <!--del_lnk--> Slovenes make up about 7% of Austria's total population.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Language">Language</span></h3>
       <p><a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> is Austria's official language and is spoken natively by 88.6% of the population&mdash;followed by <!--del_lnk--> Bosnian/<!--del_lnk--> Croatian/<!--del_lnk--> Serbian (4.2%), <!--del_lnk--> Turkish (2.3%), <!--del_lnk--> Hungarian (0.5%) and <!--del_lnk--> Polish (0.5%).</p>
       <p>The official German used in education, publications, announcements and websites is <!--del_lnk--> Austrian German, which is mostly identical to the German used in Germany but with some vocabulary differences. Many local dialects are spoken in Austria, and though their base is Austrian German, their corresponding speakers meet certain degrees of difficulty when trying to understand each other.</p>
       <p>The Austrian federal states of <!--del_lnk--> Carinthia and <!--del_lnk--> Styria are home to a significant indigenous <!--del_lnk--> Slovene-speaking minority while in the easternmost state, <!--del_lnk--> Burgenland (formerly part of the Hungarian portion of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Austria-Hungary.htm" title="Austria&ndash;Hungary">Austria&ndash;Hungary</a>), there are significant <!--del_lnk--> Hungarian- and <!--del_lnk--> Croatian-speaking minorities. Of the remaining number of Austria's people that are of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former <!--del_lnk--> East Bloc nations. So-called <!--del_lnk--> guest workers <i>(Gastarbeiter)</i> and their descendants, as well as refugees from the <!--del_lnk--> Yugoslav wars and other conflicts, also form an important <!--del_lnk--> minority group in Austria. Since 1994 the <a href="../../wp/r/Romani_people.htm" title="Romani people">Roma</a>&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> Sinti (gypsies) have been an officially recognised ethnic minority in Austria.</p>
       <p>According to census information published by <!--del_lnk--> Statistik Austria for 2001 there were a total of 710,926 foreign nationals living in Austria. Of these, the largest by far are 283,334 foreign nationals from the <!--del_lnk--> former Yugoslavia (of whom 135,336 speak Serbian; 105,487 Croatian; 31,591 Bosnian &ndash; i.e. 272,414 Austrian resident native speakers in total, plus 6,902 Slovenian and 4,018 Macedonian speakers).</p>
       <p>The second largest population of linguistic and ethnic groups are the <!--del_lnk--> Turks (including minority of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/k/Kurdish_people.htm" title="Kurds">Kurds</a>) with a number of 200,000 to 300,000 who currently live in Austria. The Turks and The Kurds are the largest single immigrant group in Austria, closely followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Serbs.</p>
       <p>The next largest population of linguistic and ethnic groups are the 124,392 who speak German as their <!--del_lnk--> mother tongue even though they hail from outside of Austria (mainly immigrants from Germany, some from Switzerland, <!--del_lnk--> South Tyrol in Italy, <!--del_lnk--> Romania, or the <!--del_lnk--> former Soviet Union); 123,417; English; 24,446 Albanian; 17,899 Polish; 14,699 Hungarian; 12,216 Romanian; 10,000 Malayali; 7,982 Arabic; 6,891 Slovak; 6,707 Czech; 5,916 Persian; 5,677 Italian; 5,466 Russian; 5,213 French; 4,938 Chinese; 4,264 Spanish; 3,503 Bulgarian. The numbers for other languages fall off sharply below 3,000.</p>
       <p>As of 2006, some of the Austrian states introduced standardised tests for new citizens, to assure their language ability, cultural knowledge and accordingly their ability to integrate into the Austrian society. For the national rules, see <!--del_lnk--> Austrian nationality law &ndash; Naturalisation.</p>

       <p>Historically, Austrians were regarded as <!--del_lnk--> Germans and part of the great German nation, since Austria was part of the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> until its ending in 1806 and as part of the <!--del_lnk--> German Confederation until the <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Prussian war in 1866 which resulted in Austria being excluded from <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_Germany.htm" title="History of Germany">Germany</a> by Prussia. Following the founding of the nation-state <!--del_lnk--> German Empire in 1871 <i>without</i> Austria, and along with the events of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, Austrians have developed their own distinct <!--del_lnk--> national identity and in the modern day do not consider themselves Germans. Today 91,1% of the population are regarded as ethnic Austrians.</p>
       <p>An estimated 13,000 to 40,000 <!--del_lnk--> Slovenes in the Austrian state of <!--del_lnk--> Carinthia (the <!--del_lnk--> Carinthian Slovenes) as well as <!--del_lnk--> Croats (around 30,000) and <!--del_lnk--> Hungarians in Burgenland were recognised as a minority and have had special rights following the Austrian State Treaty (<span lang="de"><i>Staatsvertrag</i></span>) of 1955. The Slovenes in the Austrian state of <!--del_lnk--> Styria (estimated at a number between 1,600 and 5,000) are not recognised as a minority and do not have special rights, although the State Treaty of 27 July 1955 states otherwise.</p>
       <p>The right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where Slovene- and Croat-Austrians live alongside the German speaking population (as required by the 1955 State Treaty) is still to be fully implemented. Many Carinthians are afraid of <a href="../../wp/s/Slovenia.htm" title="Slovenia">Slovenian</a> territorial claims, pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two <!--del_lnk--> World Wars and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, <!--del_lnk--> J&ouml;rg Haider, has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the K&auml;rntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.</p>
       <p>Another interesting phenomenon is the so-called "<!--del_lnk--> Windischen-Theorie" stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and <i>Windische</i> (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term <i>Windische</i> was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction. This politically influenced theory, dividing Slovene Austrians into the "loyal Windische" and the "national Slovenes", was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago.</p>

       <p>At the end of the 20th century, about 74% of Austria's population were registered as Roman Catholic, while about 5% considered themselves <!--del_lnk--> Protestants. Austrian Christians are obliged to pay a mandatory membership fee (calculated by income&mdash;about 1%) to their church; this payment is called "Kirchenbeitrag" ("Ecclesiastical/Church contribution").</p>
       <p>Since the second half of the 20th century, the number of adherents and churchgoers has declined. Data for the end of 2012 from the Austrian Roman Catholic church lists 5,360,000 members, or 63.5% of the total Austrian population. Sunday church attendance was 753,701 or 9% of the total Austrian population in 2005. The Lutheran church also recorded a loss of 47,904 adherents between 2001 and 2008. European Commission survey of 2012 indicates that 86% of the Austrian population is Christian and 77% are Roman Catholic.</p>
       <p>About 12% of the population declared that they have <!--del_lnk--> no religion. in 2001. Of the remaining people, around 340,000 are registered as members of various Muslim communities, mainly due to the influx from <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.htm" title="Bosnia-Herzegovina">Bosnia-Herzegovina</a> and <a href="../../wp/k/Kosovo.htm" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>. About 180,000 are members of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Orthodox Church">Orthodox Churches</a> (mostly <!--del_lnk--> Serbs), about 21,000 people are active <!--del_lnk--> Jehovah's Witnesses and about 8,100 are <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/Jews.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a>.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Austrian Jewish Community of 1938&mdash;Vienna alone counted more than 200,000&mdash;was reduced to around 4,500 during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, with approximately 65,000 Jewish Austrians killed in <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> and 130,000 emigrating. The large majority of the current Jewish population are post-war immigrants, particularly from eastern Europe and central Asia (including <!--del_lnk--> Bukharan Jews). <!--del_lnk--> Buddhism was legally recognised as a religion in Austria in 1983.</p>
       <p>According to the most recent <!--del_lnk--> Eurobarometer Poll 2010,</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b>44%</b> of Austrian citizens responded that <i>"they believe there is a God"</i>.</li>

       <p>While northern and central Germany was the origin of the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation, Austria and Bavaria were the heart of the <!--del_lnk--> Counter-Reformation in the 16th and 17th centuries, when the absolute monarchy of <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg imposed a strict regime to restore Catholicism's power and influence among Austrians. The Habsburgs for a long time viewed themselves as the vanguard of Catholicism and all other confessions and religions were repressed.</p>
       <p>In 1775, Maria Theresa gave official permission to the <!--del_lnk--> Mechistarist Congregation of the <!--del_lnk--> Armenian Catholic Church to settle in the Habsburg Empire.</p>
       <p>In 1781, in the era of Austrian enlightenment, <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Joseph II issued a Patent of Tolerance for Austria that allowed other confessions a limited <!--del_lnk--> freedom of worship. Religious freedom was declared a constitutional right in Cisleithania after the Austro-Hungarian <i><!--del_lnk--> Ausgleich</i> in 1867 thus paying tribute to the fact that the monarchy was home of numerous religions beside Roman Catholicism such as Greek, Serbian, Romanian, Russian, and Bulgarian <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Orthodox Christians">Orthodox Christians</a> (Austria neighboured the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> for centuries), <!--del_lnk--> Calvinist, <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran <!--del_lnk--> Protestants and Jews. In 1912, after the annexation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.htm" title="Bosnia Hercegovina">Bosnia Hercegovina</a> in 1908, <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> was officially recognised in Austria.</p>
       <p>Austria remained largely influenced by Catholicism. After 1918, First Republic Catholic leaders such as <!--del_lnk--> Theodor Innitzer and <!--del_lnk--> Ignaz Seipel took leading positions within or close to Austria's government and increased their influence during the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Austrofascism; Catholicism was treated much like a <!--del_lnk--> state religion by <!--del_lnk--> Engelbert Dollfuss and <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Schuschnigg. Although Catholic (and Protestant) leaders initially welcomed the Germans in 1938 during the <a href="../../wp/a/Anschluss.htm" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a> of Austria into Germany, Austrian Catholicism stopped its supportof <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> later on and many former religious public figures became involved with the resistance during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a>. After the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> in 1945, a stricter <!--del_lnk--> secularism was imposed in Austria, and religious influence on politics declined.</p>

       <p>Education in Austria is entrusted partly to the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian states (Bundesl&auml;nder) and partly to the federal government. School attendance is <!--del_lnk--> compulsory for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Pre-school education (called <i>Kindergarten</i> in German), free in most states, is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered a normal part of a child's education due to its high takeup rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.</p>
       <p>Primary education, or <!--del_lnk--> Volksschule, lasts for four years, starting at age six. The maximum class size is 30, but may be as low as 15. It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child's well-being. The so-called "<!--del_lnk--> 3Rs"(Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no <!--del_lnk--> streaming.</p>
       <p>Standard attendance times are 8&nbsp;am to 12&nbsp;pm or 1&nbsp;pm, with hourly five- or ten-minute breaks. Children are given homework daily from the first year. Historically there has been no lunch hour, with children returning home to eat. However, due to a rise in the number of mothers in work, primary schools are increasingly offering pre-lesson and afternoon care.</p>
       <p>As in Germany, secondary education consists of two main types of schools, attendance at which is based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school. The <!--del_lnk--> Gymnasium caters for the more able children, in the final year of which the <!--del_lnk--> Matura examination is taken, which is a requirement for access to university. The <!--del_lnk--> Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education (<!--del_lnk--> H&ouml;here Technische Lehranstalt HTL = institution of higher technical education; HAK = commercial academy; <!--del_lnk--> HBLA = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.). Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the <!--del_lnk--> Matura. Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule, and are known as <!--del_lnk--> Gesamtschulen. In addition, a recognition of the importance of learning English has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream, in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum, a portion of the lesson time being conducted in English.</p>

       </div>
       <p>As at primary school, lessons at Gymnasium begin at 8&nbsp;am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon, with children returning home to a late lunch. Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch, generally eaten at school. As at primary level, all pupils follow the same plan of work. Great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing. Satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report ("Zeugnis") are a prerequisite for moving up ("aufsteigen") to the next class. Pupils who do not meet the required standard re-sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays; those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re-sit the year ("sitzenbleiben").</p>
       <p>It is not uncommon for a pupil to re-sit more than one year of school. After completing the first two years, pupils choose between one of two strands, known as "Gymnasium" (slightly more emphasis on arts) or "Realgymnasium" (slightly more emphasis on science). Whilst many schools offer both strands, some do not, and as a result, some children move schools for a second time at age 12. At age 14, pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands, or to change to a vocational course, possibly with a further change of school.</p>
       <p>The Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the <!--del_lnk--> Matura examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as Medicine. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee ("<i>Studienbeitrag</i>") of &euro;363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, as long as a certain time-limit is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance). When the time-limit is exceeded, the fee of around &euro;363.36 per term is charged. Some further exceptions to the fee apply, e.g. for students with a year's salary of more than about &euro;5000. In all cases, an obligatory fee of &euro;17 is charged for the student union and insurance.</p>

       <p>Vienna was for a long time an important centre of musical innovation. 18th and 19th century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.</p>
       <p>Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural centre in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments including the <!--del_lnk--> lute. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_van_Beethoven.htm" title="Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> spent the better part of his life in Vienna.

       <p>Austria produced one notable jazz musician, keyboardist <!--del_lnk--> Josef Zawinul, who helped pioneer electronic influences in jazz as well as being a notable composer in his own right. The <!--del_lnk--> pop and rock musician <!--del_lnk--> Falco was internationally acclaimed during the 1980s, especially for his song "<!--del_lnk--> Rock Me Amadeus" dedicated to Mozart.

       <p>Austria's cuisine is derived from that of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Austria-Hungary.htm" title="Austro-Hungarian Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine ("Hofk&uuml;che") delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the "Mehlspeisen" Bakery, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, "Krapfen" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and "Strudel" such as "<!--del_lnk--> Apfelstrudel" filled with apple, "Topfenstrudel" filled with a type of cheese curd called "topfen", and "<!--del_lnk--> Millirahmstrudel" (milk-cream strudel).</p>
       <p>In addition to native regional traditions, the cuisine has been influenced by <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungarian</a>, Bohemia <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Czech_Republic.htm" title="Czech republic">Czech</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/Jews.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a>, Italian, <!--del_lnk--> Balkan and French cuisine, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian cuisine is therefore one of the most multicultural and transcultural in Europe.</p>
