<p>An example child sponsorship letter from Ober&#xE1;, Argentina:<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Dear <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sponsorachild_A.htm">Sponsors</a>,</em></p>
<p><em><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_AXRImage_preview" alt="Children at Obera, Argentina" />Please receive warm greetings from our <a title="Child Sponsorship Background from Ober&#xE1;, Argentina" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/o/Obera_Child_Sponsorship_Background.htm">SOS Children&#x2019;s Village of Ober&#xE1;</a>!
 Once again we have the opportunity to come closer to you hereby and to 
tell you about the boys, girls and youngsters of our SOS families, as 
also to share with you the activities done at the SOS School along this 
period. We also would like to take this opportunity to thank you once 
more from the bottom of our heart for your generous contribution, which 
enables us to give the children a new home, a family and a better 
education.</em></p>
<h3><strong>The SOS School</strong></h3>
<p><em>Nowadays, about 900 pupils are attending our SOS School: counting 112
 four- and five year old children in the Nursery, 433 in primary school,
 246 in secondary school and 83 youngsters and adults attending our 
vocational training centre.</em></p>
<p><em>The end of the year 2009 came along as every year, full of emotions; 
parents seeing another year to finish for their sons and daughters, and 
the children fulfilling a year more, loaded with new experiences and 
longing for their excitedly expected vacations. At the act, there were 
mementoes of their way through school handed over, to the initial level 
pupils promoted to the first grade, as to those finishing their 
elementary level or third year of high school. The children also took 
table adornments and candles along, to share at the Christmas table with
 their families. The children themselves made those presents during the 
extended schedule workshops.</em></p>
<p><em>The beginning of the school year was filled with excitement, 
especially for those children going to nursery for the first time; their
 nursery teachers welcomed them at a new world with songs and games 
there. This also happened to the children starting the first grade, who 
accompanied by their former nursery teachers, begun this year at new 
activities, expectant about all novelties awaiting them there.</em></p>
<p><em>The Revolution of May 1810 was of crucial impact for our people and 
undoubtedly marked a before and an after at the Argentine Republic&#x2019;s 
history. This revolution was a historic process resulting in rupture of 
the colonial laces that in those times tied us to Spain and enabling the
 move towards independence of our country by July 9, 1816.</em></p>
<p><em>This year the Bicentennial of the First National Government is 
celebrated with great exaltation. Therefore, all over the country 
multiple acts and festivities were performed to the evocation of that 
day. As along the whole country, our school could not be oblivious to 
the celebrations of our countries&#x2019; bicentennial, and therefore almost 
all activities done during the first months of the year were related to 
that event. Such for instance the pupils from the fourth, fifth and 
sixth grade of elementary experienced it; within the frame of a 
co-participation project with another school of the city of Ober&#xE1;, they 
took part at a dance seminar to learn the National &#x2018;Peric&#xF3;n&#x2019; 
(traditional Argentine dance), then to perform during the bicentennial 
festivities. At school a festive atmosphere was lived out, everybody 
worked helping to adorn the school and preparing themselves joyfully for
 the celebrations.</em></p>
<h3><strong>The Village</strong></h3>
<p><em>At the present time 96 boys, girls and youngsters are part of our 
families at the SOS Children&#x2019;s Village of Obera, while 9 youngsters live
 outside the SOS Children&#x2019;s Village at guided living programme and 
undertaking their first steps towards autonomous life.&nbsp; <br /></em></p>
<p><em><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_AXSImage_preview" alt="Children from Obera, Argentina" />As already 
six months of this year 2010 have gone by, we started the year with 
interesting and fun outings, trips and some visits to biological 
families living at small towns of the inner Misiones province. As every 
year during the summer recess, the SOS families have been able to enjoy 
the barnyard belonging to the SOS Children&#x2019;s Village, spending moments 
of the warm summer at this magical place. Through the barnyard runs a 
big creek, where the children can fish and swim freely. There the 
families could enjoy exuberant vegetation that characterizes the area 
and relax amid nature at open air, practicing sports and playing for 
long hours.</em></p>
<p><em>To this time of the year, the children are already fully inserted 
into their daily routine, and anxiously expect the winter vacations by 
July. Aside from going to school, the children also continue assisting 
to their extracurricular practices, thus as sports, arts and cultural 
ones. Among them, we can cite workshops on ceramics, handicrafts, 
English, chess, guitar, soccer, athletics, informatics, and plastic 
arts. Some children of the SOS Children&#x2019;s Village also take part at 
dance groups of the different local communities. The presence of those 
communities in the area is due to large amount of immigrants coming from
 different countries to the province of Misiones by the beginnings of 
last century. German, Swiss, Italian, Spanish, Polish and Ukrainian 
immigrants, among others, once a year recall their roots at the 
&#x2018;Immigrants Fest&#x2019;, held in the city of Ober&#xE1;. This festivity is very 
important to the city, since it relates to its identity and history. The
 children assist to dance workshops, where they practice with great 
enthusiasm along the year; to then take part at the major parade of 
communities taking place during the &#x2018;Immigrants Fest&#x2019; by September.</em></p>
<p><em>Aside from taking part at extracurricular
 workshops, those children and youngsters requiring it, continue getting
 extra tuition at different subjects. Children and youngsters understand
 that the years of schooling are essential to obtain the necessary tools
 to achieve a well-rounded education as to reach to be in a future men 
and women capable of carrying on an independent life, even to think of 
building their own families.</em></p>
<p><em>We hope that we could give you an overview of our daily work through 
this report. We say good-bye, handing over kind greetings to you, on 
behalf of the entire community of the SOS Children&#x2019;s Village Ober&#xE1;, 
which also sincerely thanks you for your support and generosity.</em></p>
