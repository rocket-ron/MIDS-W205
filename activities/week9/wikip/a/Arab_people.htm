       <p><b>Arab people</b>, also known as <b>Arabs</b> (<a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar"><big>&#x639;&#x631;&#x628;</big></span>&lrm;, <i>&#x2BF;arab</i>), are a <!--del_lnk--> panethnicity primarily living in the <!--del_lnk--> Arab world, which is located in <!--del_lnk--> Western Asia and <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>. They are <!--del_lnk--> identified as such on one or more of <a href="../../wp/g/Genealogy.htm" title="Genealogy">genealogical</a>, <!--del_lnk--> linguistic, or <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">cultural</a> grounds, with tribal affiliations, and intra-tribal relationships playing an important part of Arab identity.</p>
       <p>The word "Arab" has had several different, but overlapping, meanings over the centuries (and sometimes even today). In addition to including all Arabized people of the world (with language tending to be the acid test), it has also at times been used exclusively for <!--del_lnk--> bedouin (Arab nomads [although a related word, "`a-RAB," with the Arabic letter "alif" in the second syllable, once was sometimes used when this specific meaning was intended] and their now almost entirely settled descendants). It is sometimes used that way colloquially even today in some places. Townspeople once were sometimes called "sons of the Arabs." As in the case of other ethnicities or nations, people identify themselves (or are identified by others) as "Arabs" to varying degrees. This may not be one's primary identity (it tends to compete with country, religion, sect, etc.), and whether it is emphasized may depend upon one's audience.</p>
       <p>If the diverse Arab pan-ethnicity is regarded as a single ethnic group, then it constitutes one of the world's largest after <!--del_lnk--> Han Chinese.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
       <p>The earliest documented use of the word "Arab" to refer to a <!--del_lnk--> people appears in the <!--del_lnk--> Monolith Inscription, an <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian language record of the 9th century BC <!--del_lnk--> Assyrian Conquest of Syria (Arabs had formed part of a coalition of forces opposed to Assyria). Listed among the booty captured by the army of king <!--del_lnk--> Shalmaneser III of <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyria</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Qarqar are 1000 camels of "Gi-in-di-bu'u the ar-ba-a-a" or "[the man] <!--del_lnk--> Gindibu belonging to the <i>&#x295;arab</i>" (<i>ar-ba-a-a</i> being an adjectival <!--del_lnk--> nisba of the noun <i>&#x295;arab</i>).</p>
       <p>The most popular Arab account holds that the word 'Arab' came from an eponymous father called <!--del_lnk--> Yarab, who was supposedly the first to speak Arabic. <!--del_lnk--> Al-Hamdani had another view; he states that Arabs were called Gh<b>Arab</b> (West in Semitic) by <!--del_lnk--> Mesopotamians because Arabs resided to the west of Mesopotamia; the term was then corrupted into Arab. Yet another view is held by <!--del_lnk--> Al-Masudi that the word Arabs was initially applied to the <!--del_lnk--> Ishmaelites of the "Arabah" valley.</p>
       <p>The root of the word has many meanings in <!--del_lnk--> Semitic languages including "west/sunset," "desert," "mingle," "merchant," "raven" and are "comprehensible" with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name. It is also possible that some forms were <!--del_lnk--> metathetical from <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Semitic transliteration">&#x2BF;-B-R</span> "moving around" (Arabic <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="DIN 31635 Arabic">&#x2BF;-B-R</span> "traverse"), and hence, it is alleged, "nomadic."</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Identity">Identity</span></h2>
       <p>Arab identity is defined independently of <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religious</a> identity, and pre-dates the rise of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, with historically attested <!--del_lnk--> Arab Christian kingdoms and <!--del_lnk--> Arab Jewish tribes. Today, however, most Arabs are Muslim, with a minority adhering to other faiths, largely <!--del_lnk--> Christianity. Arabs are generally <!--del_lnk--> Sunni, <!--del_lnk--> Shia or <!--del_lnk--> Sufi Muslims, but currently, 7.1 percent to 10 percent of Arabs are <!--del_lnk--> Arab Christians. This figure does not include Christian ethnic groups such as <!--del_lnk--> Assyrians, and <!--del_lnk--> Syriacs.</p>
       <p>The early Arabs were the tribes of Northern Arabia speaking proto Arabic dialects. Although since early days other people became Arabs through an Arabization process that could mean intermarriage with Arabs, adopting the Arabic language and culture, or both. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Ghassanids and the Lakhmids which originated from Southern Semitic speaking Yemen made a major contribution in the creation of the Arabic language. The same process happened all over the Arab world after the spread of Islam by the mixing of Arabs with several other peoples. The Arab cultures went through a mixing process. Therefore every Arab country has cultural specificities which constitute a cultural mix which also originate in local novelties achieved after the arabization took place. However, all Arab countries do also share a common culture in most Aspects: Arts (music, literature, poetry, calligraphy...), Cultural products (Handicrafts, carpets, henne, bronze carving...), Social behaviour and relations (Hospitality, codes of conduct among friends and family...), Customs and superstitions, Some dishes (Shorba, Mloukhia), Traditional clothing, Architecture...</p>
       <div class="thumb tright">
       </div>
       <p>Muslim but non-Arab people, who are about 80 percent of the world's <!--del_lnk--> Muslim population, do not form part of the <!--del_lnk--> Arab world, but instead comprise what is the geographically larger, and more diverse, <!--del_lnk--> Muslim World.</p>
       <p>In the USA, Arabs have historically been <!--del_lnk--> racially classified as white/Caucasian and, since 1997, by the U.S. Census as well.</p>
       <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic">Arabic</a>, the main unifying feature among Arabs, is a <!--del_lnk--> Semitic language originating in <!--del_lnk--> Arabia. From there it spread to a variety of distinct peoples across most of <!--del_lnk--> West Asia and <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, resulting in their <!--del_lnk--> acculturation and eventual denomination as Arabs. <!--del_lnk--> Arabization, a culturo-linguistic shift, was often, though not always, in conjunction with <!--del_lnk--> Islamization, a religious shift.</p>
       <p>With the rise of Islam in the 7th century, and as the language of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Quran.htm" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, Arabic became the <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca of the Islamic world. (See Anwar G. Chegne, "Arabic: Its Significance and Place in Arab-Muslim Society," Middle East Journal 19 (Autumn 1965), pp.&nbsp;447&ndash;470.) It was in this period that Arabic language and culture was widely disseminated with the early <!--del_lnk--> Islamic expansion, both <!--del_lnk--> through conquest and <!--del_lnk--> cultural contact.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Arabic culture and language, however, began a more limited diffusion before the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic age, first spreading in West Asia beginning in the 2nd century, as <!--del_lnk--> Arab Christians such as the <!--del_lnk--> Ghassanids, <!--del_lnk--> Lakhmids and <!--del_lnk--> Banu Judham began migrating north from Arabia into the <!--del_lnk--> Syrian Desert, south western <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Levant.</p>
       <p>In the modern era, defining who is an Arab is done on the grounds of one or more of the following two criteria:</p>
       <div class="thumb tright">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/1834/183404.png.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="147" src="../../images/1834/183404.png"  width="220" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

        </div>
       </div>
       <ul>
        <li><a href="../../wp/g/Genealogy.htm" title="Genealogy">Genealogical</a>: someone who can trace his or her ancestry to the <!--del_lnk--> tribes of Arabia &ndash; the original inhabitants of the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Peninsula &ndash; and the <!--del_lnk--> Syrian Desert. This was the definition used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Medieval">medieval</a> times, for example by <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Khaldun, but has decreased in importance over time, as a portion of those of Arab ancestry lost their links with their ancestors' motherland. In the modern era, however, DNA tests have at times proved reliable in identifying those of Arab genealogical descent. For example, it has been found that the frequency of the "Arab marker" Haplogroup J1 collapses suddenly at the borders of Arabic speaking countries.</li>
        <li><a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">Linguistic</a>: someone whose <!--del_lnk--> first language, and by extension cultural expression, is <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>, including any of <!--del_lnk--> its varieties. This definition covers more than 450 million people. Certain groups that fulfill this criterion reject this definition on the basis of non-Arab ancestry; such an example may be seen in the way that <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians identified themselves in the early 20th century.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The relative importance of these factors is estimated differently by different groups and frequently disputed. Some combine aspects of each definition, as done by Palestinian <!--del_lnk--> Habib Hassan Touma, who defines an <i>Arab</i> "in the modern sense of the word", as "one who is a national of an Arab state, has command of the Arabic language, and possesses a fundamental knowledge of Arab tradition, that is, of the manners, customs, and political and social systems of the culture." Most people who consider themselves Arab do so based on the overlap of the political and linguistic definitions. Few people consider themselves Arab based on the political definition without also having Arabic as a first or primary language. Thus <a href="../../wp/k/Kurdish_people.htm" title="Kurdish people">Kurds</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Assyrian <!--del_lnk--> Christians of <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and its surrounds (who primarily speak <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamian">Mesopotamian</a> <!--del_lnk--> Aramaic), <!--del_lnk--> Armenians, <!--del_lnk--> Shabak, <!--del_lnk--> Turcoman, <!--del_lnk--> Circassians and <!--del_lnk--> Baluch do not identify as Arab, and some <a href="../../wp/b/Berber_people.htm" title="Berber people">Berbers</a> have also rejected the label. Some other ethno-religious minorities within Western Asia and North Africa who do speak Arabic as their primary community language also do not identify with the Arab identity, most notably the <!--del_lnk--> Syriac Christian communities such as <!--del_lnk--> Maronites of <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Copts of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Arab_League.htm" title="Arab League">Arab League</a>, a regional organization of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Country.htm" title="Countries">countries</a> intended to encompass the Arab world, defines an Arab as:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">An Arab is a person whose language is Arabic, who lives in an Arabic-speaking country, and who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arabic-speaking peoples.</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>According to Sadek Jawad Sulaimanis the former Ambassador of Oman to the United States:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">The Arabs are defined by their culture, not by race; and their culture is defined by its essential twin constituents of Arabism and Islam. To most of the Arabs, Islam is their indigenous religion; to all of the Arabs, Islam is their indigenous civilization. The Arab identity, as such, is a culturally defined identity, which means being Arab is being someone whose mother culture, or dominant culture, is Arabism. Beyond that, he or she might be of any ancestry, of any religion or philosophical persuasion, and a citizen of any country in the world. Being Arab does not contradict with being non-Muslim or non-Semitic or not being a citizen of an Arab state. </div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>The relation of <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">&#x2BF;arab</span></i> and <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">&#x2BE;a&#x2BF;r&#x101;b</span></i> is complicated further by the notion of "lost Arabs" <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">al-&#x2BF;Arab al-ba'ida</span></i> mentioned in the Qur'an as punished for their disbelief. All contemporary Arabs were considered as descended from two ancestors, <!--del_lnk--> Qahtan and <!--del_lnk--> Adnan.</p>
       <p>Versteegh (1997) is uncertain whether to ascribe this distinction to the memory of a real difference of origin of the two groups, but it is certain that the difference was strongly felt in early Islamic times. Even in <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Spain there was enmity between the Qays of the northern and the Kalb of the southern group. The so-called <!--del_lnk--> Sabaean or Himyarite language described by <!--del_lnk--> Ab&#x16B; Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamd&#x101;n&#x12B; (died 946) appears to be a special case of language contact between the two groups, an originally north Arabic dialect spoken in the south, and influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Old South Arabian.</p>
       <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Arabs forged an <!--del_lnk--> Arab Empire (under the <!--del_lnk--> Rashidun and <!--del_lnk--> Umayyads, and later the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Abbasid_Caliphate.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasids</a>) whose borders touched southern <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> in the west, <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> in the east, <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor in the north, and the <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> in the south. This was one of the <!--del_lnk--> largest land empires in history. In much of this area, the Arabs spread <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> and the Arabic culture, science, and language (the language of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Quran.htm" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>) through <!--del_lnk--> conversion and <!--del_lnk--> cultural assimilation.</p>

       <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> International Organization for Migration, there are 13 million first-generation Arab migrants in the world, of which 5.8 reside in Arab countries. Arab expatriates contribute to the circulation of financial and human capital in the region and thus significantly promote regional development. In 2009 Arab countries received a total of 35.1 billion USD in <!--del_lnk--> remittance in-flows and remittances sent to <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> from other Arab countries are 40 to 190 per cent higher than trade revenues between these and other Arab countries.</p>
       <p>The 250,000 strong Lebanese community in <a href="../../wp/w/West_Africa.htm" title="West Africa">West Africa</a> is the largest non-African group in the region.</p>
       <p>Arab traders have long operated in <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia and along the East Africa's <!--del_lnk--> Swahili coast. <!--del_lnk--> Zanzibar was once ruled by Omani Arabs. Most of the prominent <!--del_lnk--> Indonesians, Malaysians, and Singaporeans of Arab descent are <!--del_lnk--> Hadhrami people with origins in southern Yemen in the <!--del_lnk--> Hadramawt coastal region.</p>
       <p><b>Central Asia and Caucasus</b></p>
       <p>In 1728, a Russian officer described a group of Sunni Arab nomads who populated the <a href="../../wp/c/Caspian_Sea.htm" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian</a> shores of <!--del_lnk--> Mughan (in present-day <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>) and spoke a mixed Turkic-Arabic language. It is believed that these groups migrated to the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus in the 16th century. The 1888 edition of <!--del_lnk--> Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica also mentioned a certain number of Arabs populating the <!--del_lnk--> Baku Governorate of the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Empire.htm" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>. They retained an <!--del_lnk--> Arabic dialect at least into the mid-19th century, but since then have fully assimilated with the neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Azeris and <!--del_lnk--> Tats. Today in Azerbaijan alone, there are nearly 30 settlements still holding the name <i>Arab</i> (for example, <!--del_lnk--> Arabgadim, <!--del_lnk--> Arabojaghy, <!--del_lnk--> Arab-Yengija, etc.).</p>
       <p>From the time of the Arab conquest of the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus, continuous small-scale Arab migration from various parts of the Arab world was observed in <!--del_lnk--> Dagestan influencing and shaping the culture of the local peoples. Up until the mid-20th century, there were still individuals in Dagestan who claimed Arabic to be their native language, with the majority of them living in the village of Darvag to the north-west of <!--del_lnk--> Derbent. The latest of these accounts dates to the 1930s. Most Arab communities in southern Dagestan underwent linguistic Turkicisation, thus nowadays Darvag is a majority-Azeri village.</p>
       <p>According to the <i>History of Ibn Khaldun</i>, the Arabs that were once in Central Asia have been either killed or have fled the Tatar invasion of the region, leaving only the locals . However, today many people in Central Asia identify as Arabs. Most <!--del_lnk--> Arabs of Central Asia are fully integrated into local populations, and sometimes call themselves the same as locals (for example, <!--del_lnk--> Tajiks, <!--del_lnk--> Uzbeks) but they use special titles to show their Arabic origin such as <!--del_lnk--> Sayyid, <!--del_lnk--> Khoja or <!--del_lnk--> Siddiqui.</p>
       <p><b>South Asia</b></p>
       <p>There are only two communities with the self-identity Arab in <!--del_lnk--> South Asia, the <!--del_lnk--> Chaush of the <!--del_lnk--> Deccan region and the <!--del_lnk--> Chavuse of <!--del_lnk--> Gujerat, who are by and large descended of Hadhrami migrants who settled in these two regions in the 18th Centuries. However, both these communities no longer speak Arabic, although with the Chaush, there has been re-immigration to the Gulf States, and re-adoption of Arabic by these immigrants. In South Asia, claiming Arab ancestry is considered prestigious, and many communities have origin myths with claim to an Arab ancestry. Examples include the <!--del_lnk--> Mappilla of <a href="../../wp/k/Kerala.htm" title="Kerala">Kerala</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Labbai of <!--del_lnk--> Tamil Nadu and <!--del_lnk--> Kokan of <!--del_lnk--> Maharashtra. These communities all allege an Arab ancestry, but none speak Arabic and follow the customs and traditions of the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu majority. Among Muslims of <!--del_lnk--> North India, <!--del_lnk--> Arabs in Pakistan <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, there are groups who claim the status of <!--del_lnk--> Sayyid, have origin myths that allege descent from the Prophet Mohammmad. None of these Sayyid families speak Arabic or follow Arab customs or traditions.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Iranian Arab communities are also found in <!--del_lnk--> Khuzestan Province.</p>

       <p>There is a consensus that the <!--del_lnk--> Semitic peoples originated from <!--del_lnk--> Arabian peninsula. It should be pointed out that these settlers were not Arabs or Arabic speakers. Early non Arab <!--del_lnk--> Semitic peoples from the <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Near East, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Arameans, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Akkadian_Empire.htm" title="Akkadians">Akkadians</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Assyrians and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonians">Babylonians</a>), <!--del_lnk--> Amorites, <!--del_lnk--> Israelites, <!--del_lnk--> Eblaites, <!--del_lnk--> Ugarites and <!--del_lnk--> Canaanites, built civilizations in <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Levant; genetically, they often interlapped and mixed. Slowly, however, they lost their political domination of the <!--del_lnk--> Near East due to internal turmoil and attacks by non-Semitic peoples. Although the Semites eventually lost political control of Western Asia to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/History_of_Iran.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Aramaic language remained the <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca of <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyria</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Levant.

       <p>The first written attestation of the ethnonym "Arab" occurs in an <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a> inscription of 853 BCE, where <!--del_lnk--> Shalmaneser III lists a King <!--del_lnk--> Gindibu of <i>m&acirc;tu arb&acirc;i</i> (Arab land) as among the people he defeated at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Karkar. Some of the names given in these texts are <!--del_lnk--> Aramaic, while others are the first attestations of <!--del_lnk--> Ancient North Arabian dialects. In fact several different ethnonyms are found in Assyrian texts that are conventionally translated "Arab": <i>Arabi, Arubu, Aribi</i> and <i>Urbi</i>. Many of the <!--del_lnk--> Qedarite queens were also described as queens of the <i>aribi</i>. The <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew Bible occasionally refers to <i>Aravi</i> peoples (or variants thereof), translated as "Arab" or "Arabian." The scope of the term at that early stage is unclear, but it seems to have referred to various desert-dwelling <!--del_lnk--> Semitic tribes in the <!--del_lnk--> Syrian Desert and <!--del_lnk--> Arabia. Arab tribes came into conflict with the <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyrians</a> during the reign of the Assyrian king <!--del_lnk--> Ashurbanipal, and he records military victories against the powerful <!--del_lnk--> Qedar tribe among others.</p>

       <p>Medieval Arab <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Genealogy.htm" title="Genealogist">genealogists</a> divided Arabs into three groups:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>"Ancient Arabs", tribes that had vanished or been destroyed, such as <!--del_lnk--> &#x2BF;&#x100;d and <!--del_lnk--> Thamud, often mentioned in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Quran.htm" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> as examples of God's power to destroy those who did not believe and follow their prophets and messengers.</li>
        <li>"Pure Arabs" of South Arabia, descending from <!--del_lnk--> Qahtan. The <!--del_lnk--> Qahtanites (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated from the land of <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> following the destruction of the <!--del_lnk--> Ma'rib Dam (<i>sadd Ma'rib</i>).</li>
        <li>The "Arabized Arabs" (<i>musta`ribah</i>) of centre and North Arabia, descending from <!--del_lnk--> Ishmael the elder son of <!--del_lnk--> Abraham. The <!--del_lnk--> Book of Genesis narrates that <!--del_lnk--> God promised <!--del_lnk--> Hagar to beget from Ishmael twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.<sup>(<!--del_lnk--> Genesis 17:20)</sup> The <!--del_lnk--> Book of Jubilees, in the other hand, claims that the sons of <!--del_lnk--> Ishmael intermingled with the 6 sons of <!--del_lnk--> Keturah, from <!--del_lnk--> Abraham, and their descendants were called Arabs and <!--del_lnk--> Ishmaelites: <blockquote>
          <p>Book of <!--del_lnk--> Jubilees 20:13 <i>And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of <!--del_lnk--> Keturah and their sons, went together and dwelt from <!--del_lnk--> Paran to the entering in of <!--del_lnk--> Babylon in all the land which is towards the East facing the desert. And these mingled with each other, and their name was called Arabs, and <!--del_lnk--> Ishmaelites.</i></p>
         </blockquote>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Ibn Khaldun's <i><!--del_lnk--> Muqaddima</i> distinguishes between sedentary Muslims who used to be <!--del_lnk--> nomadic Arabs and the Bedouin nomadic Arabs of the desert. He used the term "formerly-nomadic" Arabs and refers to sedentary Muslims by the region or city they lived in, as in <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians, <!--del_lnk--> Spaniards and <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemenis</a>. The Christians of Italy and the Crusaders preferred the term <!--del_lnk--> Saracens for all the Arabs and Muslims of that time. The Christians of Iberia used the term <!--del_lnk--> Moor to describe all the Arabs and Muslims of that time. Muslims of <a href="../../wp/m/Medina.htm" title="Medina">Medina</a> referred to the <!--del_lnk--> nomadic tribes of the deserts as the A'raab, and considered themselves sedentary, but were aware of their close racial bonds. The term "A'raab' mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria.</p>
       <p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/q/Quran.htm" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> does not use the word <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">&#x2BF;arab</span></i>, only the <!--del_lnk--> nisba adjective <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">&#x2BF;arabiy</span></i>. The Qur'an calls itself <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">&#x2BF;arabiy</span></i>, "Arabic", and <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">Mubin</span></i>, "clear". The two qualities are connected for example in ayat <!--del_lnk--> 43.2&ndash;3, "By the <i>clear</i> Book: We have made it an <i>Arabic</i> recitation in order that you may understand". The Qur'an became regarded as the prime example of the <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">al-&#x2BF;arabiyya</span></i>, the language of the Arabs. The term <i><!--del_lnk--> <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">&#x2BE;i&#x2BF;r&#x101;b</span></i> has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">&#x2BE;a&#x2BF;r&#x101;b</span></i> refers to the <!--del_lnk--> Bedouin tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ayat <!--del_lnk--> 9.97, <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">al&#x2BE;a&#x2BF;r&#x101;bu &#x2BE;a&scaron;addu kufr&#x101;n wa nif&#x101;q&#x101;n</span></i> "the Bedouin are the worst in <!--del_lnk--> disbelief and hypocrisy".</p>
       <p>Based on this, in early Islamic terminology, <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">&#x2BF;arabiy</span></i> referred to the language, and <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">&#x2BE;a&#x2BF;r&#x101;b</span></i> to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. But after the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic conquest of the 8th century, the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following <!--del_lnk--> Abi Ishaq, and the term <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="Arabic transliteration">kalam al-&#x2BF;Arab</span>, "language of the Arabs", denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.</p>

       <p>Proto-Arabic, or <!--del_lnk--> Ancient North Arabian, texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of <!--del_lnk--> epigraphic south Arabian <i><!--del_lnk--> musnad</i> script, including the 8th century BCE <!--del_lnk--> Hasaean inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, the 6th century BCE <!--del_lnk--> Lihyanite texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the <!--del_lnk--> Thamudic texts found throughout Arabia and the <!--del_lnk--> Sinai (not in reality connected with <!--del_lnk--> Thamud).</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Nabataeans were nomadic newcomers who moved into territory vacated by the <!--del_lnk--> Edomites &ndash; Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in <!--del_lnk--> Aramaic, but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The <!--del_lnk--> Nabataean Alphabet was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by <!--del_lnk--> Safaitic inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in <!--del_lnk--> Nabataean inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from Qaryat al-Faw (near <!--del_lnk--> Sulayyil) reveal a dialect which is no longer considered "proto-Arabic", but pre-classical Arabic. Five <!--del_lnk--> Syriac inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at <!--del_lnk--> Sumatar Harabesi, one of which has been dated to the 2nd century CE.</p>

        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Lakhmids as a dynasty inherited their power from the <!--del_lnk--> Tanukhids, the mid Tigris region around their capital <!--del_lnk--> Al-Hira they ended up allying with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sassanid_Empire.htm" title="Sassanid">Sassanid</a> against the <!--del_lnk--> Ghassanids and the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>.

The <!--del_lnk--> Persians Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602, being under puppet kings, then under their direct control.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Kindites migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais Rabi'a tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arbia from "Qaryah Dhat Kahl" (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw) in Central Arabia.

This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the <!--del_lnk--> Arabization of the region. However, the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph <!--del_lnk--> Umar II strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the situation, demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals, but his intended reforms did not take effect as he died after only three years of rule. By now, discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Abbasid_Caliphate.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasids</a> came to power and moved the capital to <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>.</p>
       <p>Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Prior to the Arab conquest, North Africa was inhibited by various people including <!--del_lnk--> Punics, Vandals and Greeks. It was not until the 11th century that the Maghreb saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century, the Arab bedouin <!--del_lnk--> Banu Hilal tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the <!--del_lnk--> Fatimids to punish the Berber <!--del_lnk--> Zirids for abandoning <!--del_lnk--> Shiism, they travelled westwards. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Hammadids. Their influx was a major factor in the Arabization of the Maghreb, Although Berbers would rule the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the <!--del_lnk--> Almoravids, the <!--del_lnk--> Almohads, <!--del_lnk--> Hafsids, etc.), the arrival of these tribes would eventually help to Arabize much of it ethnically in addition to the linguistic and political impact on the none-Arabs there. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in 1031 AD, <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Spain was divided into small kingdoms.</p>
       <p><b>Abbassid Era</b> (750-1513)</p>
       <p>Abbasids let a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Zab effectively ending their rule in all part of the Empire except <!--del_lnk--> Al-Andalus. The Abbasids descendants of Muhammad's uncle <!--del_lnk--> Abbas, but unlike the Umayyads, they had the support of non-Arab subjects of the Umayyads. where Umayyads treated non-Arabs in contempt. Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when <!--del_lnk--> Wilayas began to fracture, afterwards in the 1190s there was a revival for their power which was put to end by the Mongols who conquered Baghdad and killed the Caliph, members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo, which fractured from the Abbasid rule two years earlier, the Mamluk generals were taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science, arts and literature.</p>

       <p>Arabs were ruled by Ottoman sultans from 1513 to 1918. Ottomans defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate when they choose to bear the title of <!--del_lnk--> Caliph.

A few individuals, the <i><!--del_lnk--> hanifs</i>, had apparently rejected <!--del_lnk--> polytheism in favour of <!--del_lnk--> monotheism unaffiliated with any particular religion.

Also, prior to the massive Sephardic emigrations to the Middle East in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Jewish communities of what are today Syria, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt and Yemen were known by other Jewish communities as <!--del_lnk--> Musta'arabi Jews or "like Arabs".
