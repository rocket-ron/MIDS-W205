       <p>His works in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> establish the doctrine of <i><!--del_lnk--> advaita</i>, the unity of the <i><!--del_lnk--> &#x101;tman</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> nirguna brahman</i>, <i>brahman</i> without attributes. His works elaborate on ideas found in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Upanishads</i>. He wrote copious commentaries on the Vedic canon (<i><!--del_lnk--> Brahma Sutra</i>, principal <i>upanishads</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Bhagavad Gita</i>) in support of his thesis.</p>
       <p>The main opponent in his work is the <!--del_lnk--> Mimamsa school of thought, though he also offers arguments against the views of some other schools like <!--del_lnk--> Samkhya and certain schools of <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.</p>
       <p>Shankara travelled across the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent to propagate his philosophy through discourses and debates with other thinkers. He established the importance of monastic life as sanctioned in the Upanishads and Brahma Sutra, in a time when the <!--del_lnk--> Mimamsa school established strict ritualism and ridiculed monasticism. He is reputed to have founded four <i><a href="#Mathas">mathas</a></i> ("monasteries"), which helped in the historical development, revival and spread of Advaita Vedanta of which he is known as the greatest revivalist. Adi Shankara is believed to be the organiser of the <!--del_lnk--> Dashanami monastic order and the founder of the <!--del_lnk--> Shanmata tradition of worship.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Birth">Birth</span></h3>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Dates">Dates</span></h4>
       <p>Several different dates have been proposed for Shankara:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>788&ndash;820 CE: This is the mainstream scholarly opinion, placing Shankara in mid to late 8th century CE. These dates are based on records at the <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration"><!--del_lnk--> &#x15A;&#x1E5B;&#x1E45;geri &#x15A;&#x101;rad&#x101; P&#x12B;&#x1E6D;ha</span>, which is the only matha to have maintained a relatively unbroken record of its Acharyas; starting with the third Acharya, one can with reasonable confidence date the others from the 8th century to the present. The Sringeri records state that Shankara was born in the 14th year of the reign of "VikramAditya", but it is unclear as to which king this name refers. Though some researchers identify the name with <!--del_lnk--> Chandragupta II (4th. c. CE), modern scholarship accepts the VikramAditya as being from the <!--del_lnk--> Chalukya dynasty of Badami, most likely <!--del_lnk--> Vikramaditya II (733&ndash;746 CE), which would place him in the middle of the 8th c. Max Muller, Macdonnel, Pathok, Deussen and Radhakrishnan all accept the dates 788&ndash;820 CE. The date 788&ndash;820 is also among those considered acceptable by <!--del_lnk--> Swami Tapasyananda, though he raises a number of questions.</li>
        <li>509&ndash;477 <!--del_lnk--> BCE: This dating, more than a millennium ahead of all others, is based on records of the heads of the Shankara <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Ma&#x1E6D;ha</span>s at <!--del_lnk--> Dvaraka Pitha and <!--del_lnk--> Govardhana matha and the fifth Peetham at Kanchi. However, the succession of acharyas at these two mathas were often disrupted by geopolitical realities and these records are not considered as reliable as the Sringeri chronology. Also, such an early date would be in conflict with much else in Indian chronology. According to these revisionist models, these are the actual dates, and it is other collateral dates, such as the date of <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> (which serves as an anchor for modern academic history of India), that need to be moved back.</ref> However, such an early date is not consistent with the fact that Shankara quotes the Buddhist logician <!--del_lnk--> Dharmakirti, who finds mention in <!--del_lnk--> Xuanzang (7th c.). Also, his near-contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Kum&#x101;rila Bha&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;a is usually dated ca. 8th c. CE. Most scholars feel that due to invasions and other discontinuities, the records of the Dwaraka and Govardhana mathas are not as reliable as those of Sringeri. Thus, while considerable debate exists, the pre-Christian Era dates are usually discounted, and the most likely period for Shankara is during the 8th c. CE.</li>
        <li>44&ndash;12 <!--del_lnk--> BCE: Anandagiri believed he was born at Chidambaram in 44 BCE and died in 12 BCE.</li>
        <li>6th century CE: Telang placed him in this century. Sir R G Bandarkar believed he was born in 680 CE.</li>
        <li>805&ndash;897 CE: A D Venkiteswara not only places Adishankara later than most, but also had the opinion that it would not have been possible for him to have achieved all the works apportioned to him, and has him live ninety two years.</li>
       </ul>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Shankara was born in Kaladi in present day central Kerala, the ancient Tamil kingdom of the Cheras. According to lore, it was after his parents, who had been childless for many years, prayed at the <!--del_lnk--> Vadakkunnathan temple, <!--del_lnk--> Thrissur, that <a href="../../wp/s/Shiva.htm" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> appeared to both husband and wife in their dreams, and offered them a choice: a mediocre son who would live a long life, or an extraordinary son who would not live long. Both the parents chose the latter; thus a son was born to them. He was named Shankara (Sanskrit, "bestower of happiness"), in honour of <a href="../../wp/s/Shiva.htm" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> (one of whose epithets is <i><!--del_lnk--> Shankara</i>). His father died while Shankara was very young. Shankara's <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration"><!--del_lnk--> upanayanam.</span></i>, the initiation into student-life, had to be delayed due to the death of his father, and was then performed by his mother. As a child, Shankara showed remarkable scholarship, mastering the four <!--del_lnk--> Vedas by the age of eight.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sannyasa">Sannyasa</span></h3>
       <p>At the age of 8, Shankara was inclined towards <!--del_lnk--> sannyasa, but it was only after much persuasion that his mother finally gave her consent. He only received her consent in a very interesting manner. While bathing in the river Poorna one day, a crocodile caught hold of his leg. Shankara appealed to his mother, who had arrived at Poorna, asking for permission to become a sanyasi. His mother finally gave consent, only to have the crocodile let go of young Shankara. A crocodile had never been found in Poorna ever since Shankara then left Kerala and travelled towards <!--del_lnk--> North India in search of a <!--del_lnk--> guru. On the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Narmada River, he met <!--del_lnk--> Govinda Bhagavatpada the disciple of <!--del_lnk--> Gaudapada at <!--del_lnk--> Omkareshwar. When Govinda Bhagavatpada asked Shankara's identity, he replied with an <!--del_lnk--> extempore verse that brought out the <!--del_lnk--> Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Govinda Bhagavatapada was impressed and took Shankara as his disciple.</p>
       <p>The guru instructed Shankara to write a commentary on the <!--del_lnk--> Brahma Sutras and propagate the Advaita philosophy. Shankara travelled to <a href="../../wp/v/Varanasi.htm" title="Varanasi">Kashi</a>, where a young man named <!--del_lnk--> Sanandana, hailing from <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Chola_dynasty.htm" title="Chola">Chola</a> territory in <!--del_lnk--> South India, became his first disciple. According to legend, while on his way to the <!--del_lnk--> Vishwanath Temple, a <!--del_lnk--> untouchable accompanied by four dogs came in the way of Sankara. When asked to move aside by Shankara's disciples, the untouchable replied: "Do you wish that I move my ever lasting <!--del_lnk--> &#x100;tman ("the Self"), or this body made of flesh?" Realizing that the untouchable was none other than <!--del_lnk--> god <a href="../../wp/s/Shiva.htm" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> himself, and his dogs the four <!--del_lnk--> Vedas, Shankara prostrated himself before him, composing five <i><!--del_lnk--> shlokas</i> known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Manisha Panchakam</i>.</p>
       <p>At <!--del_lnk--> Badari he wrote his famous <i><!--del_lnk--> Bhashyas</i> ("commentaries") and <i>Prakarana granthas</i> ("philosophical treatises").</p>

       </div>
       <p>One of the most famous debates of Adi Shankara was with the <!--del_lnk--> ritualist <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration"><!--del_lnk--> Ma&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;ana Mi&#x15B;ra</span>. <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Ma&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;ana Mi&#x15B;ra</span> held the view that the life of a householder was far superior to that of a monk. This view was widely shared and respected throughout India at that time. Thus it would have been important for Adi Shankara to debate with him. Madana Mishra's guru was the famous Mimamsa philosopher, <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration"><!--del_lnk--> Kum&#x101;rila Bha&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;a</span>. Shankara sought a debate with <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Kum&#x101;rila Bha&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;a</span> and met him in <!--del_lnk--> Prayag where he had buried himself in a slow burning pyre to repent for sins committed against his guru: <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Kum&#x101;rila Bha&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;a</span> had learned <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist philosophy from his Buddhist guru under false pretenses, in order to be able to refute it. Learning anything without the knowledge of one's guru while still under his authority constitutes a sin according to the Vedas. <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Kum&#x101;rila Bha&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;a</span> thus asked Adi Shankara to proceed to <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Mahi&#x1E63;mati</span> to meet <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Ma&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;ana Mi&#x15B;ra</span> and debate with him instead.(Mahishmati is on the banks of the holy river &ndash; Narmada, in Madhya Pradesh. Mahishmati is now known as Mandala. . Mandala finds mention in Pauranic literature as the capital of Sahasrabahu Kartyaveer Arjun who had obstructed the river by his thousand arms by his frolicking, at his capital Mahishmati),</p>
       <p>After debating for over fifteen days, with <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Ma&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;ana Mi&#x15B;ra</span>'s wife <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Ubhaya Bh&#x101;rat&#x12B;</span> acting as referee, <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Ma&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;ana Mi&#x15B;ra</span> accepted defeat. <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Ubhaya Bh&#x101;rat&#x12B;</span> then challenged Adi Shankara to have a debate with her in order to 'complete' the victory. She asked him questions related to sexual congress between man and woman &ndash; a subject in which Shankaracharya had no knowledge, since he was a true celibate and sannyasi. Sri Shankracharya asked for a "recess" of 15 days. As per legend, he used the art of "para-kaya pravesa" (the spirit leaving one's own body and entering another's) and exited his own body, which he asked his disciples to look after, and psychically entered the dead body of a king. The story goes that from the King's two wives, he acquired all knowledge of "art of love". The queens, thrilled at the keen intellect and robust love-making of the "revived" King, deduced that he was not their husband, as of old. The story continues that they sent their factotums to "look for the lifeless body of a young sadhu and to cremate it immediately" so that their "king" (Shankracharya in the king's body) would continue to live with them. Just as the retainers piled Shankracharaya's lifeless corpse upon a pyre and were about to set fire to it, Shankara entered his own body and regained consciousness. Finally, he answered all questions put to him by <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Ubhaya Bh&#x101;rat&#x12B;</span>; and she allowed <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Ma&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;ana Mi&#x15B;ra</span> to accept <i>sannyasa</i> with the <!--del_lnk--> monastic name <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration"><!--del_lnk--> Sure&#x15B;var&#x101;c&#x101;rya</span>, as per the agreed-upon rules of the debate.</p>

       <p>After this, Adi Shankara began a <i>Dig-vijaya</i> "tour of conquest" for the propagation of the Advaita philosophy by controverting all philosophies opposed to it. He travelled throughout India, from South India to <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> and Nepal, preaching to the local populace and debating philosophy with Hindu, Buddhist and other scholars and monks along the way.</p>
       <p>With the <!--del_lnk--> Malayali King Sudhanva as companion, Shankara passed through <!--del_lnk--> Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and <!--del_lnk--> Vidarbha. He then started towards <!--del_lnk--> Karnataka where he encountered a band of armed <!--del_lnk--> Kapalikas. King Sudhanva, with his Nairs, resisted and defeated the Kapalikas.

       <p>Proceeding to <!--del_lnk--> Saurashtra (the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Kambhoja) and having visited the shrines of Girnar, Somnath and Prabhasa and explaining the superiority of Vedanta in all these places, he arrived at <!--del_lnk--> Dwarka. <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Bha&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;a Bh&#x101;skara</span> of <!--del_lnk--> Ujjayini, the proponent of Bhed&#x101;beda philosophy, was humbled.

       <p>According to the tradition in Kerala, after Sankara's samadhi at Vadakkunnathan Temple his disciples founded four mathas in Thrissur, namely <!--del_lnk--> Naduvil Madhom, Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophy_and_religious_thought">Philosophy and religious thought</span></h2>
       <p><i>Advaita</i> ("non-dualism") is often called a <!--del_lnk--> monistic system of thought. The word "Advaita" essentially refers to the identity of the Self (<!--del_lnk--> Atman) and the Whole (<a href="../../wp/b/Brahman.htm" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>). Advaita Vedanta says the one unchanging entity (Brahman) alone exists, and that changing entities do not have absolute existence, much as the ocean's waves have no existence in separation from the ocean. The key source texts for all schools of <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Ved&#x101;nta</span> are the <!--del_lnk--> Prasthanatrayi&ndash;the canonical texts consisting of the <!--del_lnk--> Upanishads, the <!--del_lnk--> Bhagavad Gita and the <!--del_lnk--> Brahma Sutras.</p>
       <p>Adi Shankara was the first in the tradition to consolidate the <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">siddh&#x101;nta</span> ("doctrine") of Advaita Vedanta. He wrote commentaries on the <!--del_lnk--> Prasthana Trayi. A famous quote from <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration"><!--del_lnk--> Vivekac&#x16B;&#x1E0D;&#x101;ma&#x1E47;i</span>, one of his <i>prakarana granthas</i> that succinctly summarises his philosophy is:</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p><i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Brahma satya&#x1E43; jagat mithy&#x101;, j&#x12B;vo brahmaiva n&#x101;parah</span></i></p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p><a href="../../wp/b/Brahman.htm" title="Brahman">Brahman</a> is the only truth, the spatio-temporal world is an illusion, and there is ultimately no difference between Brahman and Atman(individual self).</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Advaita Vedanta is based on <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">&#x15B;&#x101;stra</span></i> ("scriptures"), <i>yukti</i> ("reason") and <i>anubhava</i> ("experience"), and aided by <i><!--del_lnk--> karmas</i> ("spiritual practices"). This philosophy provides a clear-cut way of life to be followed. Starting from childhood, when learning has to start, the philosophy has to be realised in practice throughout one's life, even up to death. This is the reason why this philosophy is called an experiential philosophy-the underlying tenet being "That thou art", meaning that ultimately there is no difference between the experiencer and the experienced (the world) as well as the universal spirit (<a href="../../wp/b/Brahman.htm" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>). Among the followers of Advaita, as well those of other doctrines, there are believed to have appeared <i><!--del_lnk--> Jivanmuktas</i>, ones liberated while alive. These individuals (commonly called <i><!--del_lnk--> Mahatmas</i>, great souls, among <!--del_lnk--> Hindus) are those who realised the oneness of their self and the universal spirit called Brahman.</p>
       <p>Adi Shankara's Bhashyas (commentaries) on the <!--del_lnk--> Upanishads, the <!--del_lnk--> Bhagavad Gita and the <!--del_lnk--> Brahma Sutras are his principal works. Although he mostly adhered to traditional means of commenting on the Brahma Sutra, there are a number of original ideas and arguments to establish that the essence of Upanishads is Advaita. He taught that it was only through direct knowledge that one could realise <a href="../../wp/b/Brahman.htm" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>. "A perception of the fact that the object seen is a rope will remove the fear and sorrow which result from the illusory idea that it is a serpent". Cited from Shankara's "Vivekachuudaamani"/ verse #12/translated by Mohini M Chatterji. This metaphor was borrowed from <!--del_lnk--> Yogacara <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> thinkers, who used it in a different context.</p>
       <p>Adi Shankara's opponents accused him of teaching Buddhism in the garb of Hinduism, because his non-dualistic ideals seemed rather radical to contemporary Hindu philosophy, and so he earned the title "pracchannabauddha". He further praised the Buddha as the "emperor of yogis in the Kali Age." However, although Advaita proposes the theory of <!--del_lnk--> Maya, explaining the universe as a "trick of a magician", Adi Shankara and his followers see this as a consequence of their basic premise that <a href="../../wp/b/Brahman.htm" title="Brahman">Brahman</a> alone is real. Their idea of Maya emerges from their belief in the reality of Brahman, as opposed to Buddhist doctrines of <!--del_lnk--> emptiness, which emerge from the empirical Buddhist approach of observing the nature of reality.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_and_cultural_impact">Historical and cultural impact</span></h2>
       <p>Because of his unification of two seemingly disparate philosophical doctrines, <!--del_lnk--> Atman and <a href="../../wp/b/Brahman.htm" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>, Westerners who know about him perceive him as the "<a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Aquinas.htm" title="Thomas Aquinas">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> of Indian thought" and "the most brilliant personality in the history of Indian thought."</p>
       <p>At the time of Adi Shankara's life, <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> was increasing in influence in India at the expense of <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Jainism. Hinduism was divided into innumerable sects, each quarrelling with the others. The followers of <!--del_lnk--> Mimamsa and <!--del_lnk--> Sankhya philosophy were atheists, insomuch that they did not believe in <!--del_lnk--> God as a unified being. Besides these atheists there were numerous theistic sects. There were also those who rejected the Vedas, like the <!--del_lnk--> Charvakas.</p>
       <p>Adi Shankara held discourses and debates with the leading scholars of all these sects and schools of philosophy to controvert their doctrines. He unified the theistic sects into a common framework of <!--del_lnk--> Shanmata system. In his <a href="#Works">works</a>, Adi Shankara stressed the importance of the Vedas, and his efforts helped Hinduism regain strength and popularity. Many trace the present worldwide prominence of Vedanta to his works. He travelled on foot to various parts of India to restore the study of the Vedas.</p>
       <p>Even though he lived for only thirty-two years his impact on India and on Hinduism was striking. He reintroduced a purer form of <!--del_lnk--> Vedic thought. His teachings and <!--del_lnk--> tradition form the basis of <!--del_lnk--> Smartism and have influenced <!--del_lnk--> Sant Mat lineages. He is the main figure in the tradition of <!--del_lnk--> Advaita Vedanta. He was the founder of the <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration"><!--del_lnk--> Da&#x15B;an&#x101;mi Samprad&#x101;ya</span></i> of <!--del_lnk--> Hindu <!--del_lnk--> monasticism and <i><!--del_lnk--> <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">&#x1E62;a&#x1E47;mata</span></i> of Smarta <!--del_lnk--> tradition. He introduced the <i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration"><!--del_lnk--> Pa&ntilde;c&#x101;yatana</span></i> form of <!--del_lnk--> worship.</p>
       <p>Adi Shankara, along with <!--del_lnk--> Madhva and <!--del_lnk--> Ramanuja, was instrumental in the revival of Hinduism. These three <!--del_lnk--> teachers formed the doctrines that are followed by their respective sects even today. They have been the most important figures in the recent history of <!--del_lnk--> Hindu philosophy. In their writings and debates, they provided <!--del_lnk--> polemics against the non-Vedantic schools of <!--del_lnk--> Sankhya, <!--del_lnk--> Vaisheshika etc. Thus they paved the way for <!--del_lnk--> Vedanta to be the dominant and most widely followed tradition among the schools of Hindu philosophy. The Vedanta school stresses most on the <!--del_lnk--> Upanishads (which are themselves called Vedanta, <i>End or culmination of the <!--del_lnk--> Vedas</i>), unlike the other schools that gave importance to the ritualistic <!--del_lnk--> Brahmanas, or to texts authored by their founders. The Vedanta schools hold that the Vedas (which include the Upanishads) are unauthored, forming a continuous tradition of wisdom transmitted orally. Thus the concept of <i>apaurusheyatva</i> ("being unauthored") came to be the guiding force behind the Vedanta schools. However, along with stressing the importance of <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Vedic</a> <!--del_lnk--> tradition, Adi Shankara gave equal importance to the personal experience of the student. <!--del_lnk--> Logic, <!--del_lnk--> grammar, <!--del_lnk--> Mimamsa and allied subjects form main areas of study in all the Vedanta schools.</p>
       <p>Regarding meditation, Shankara refuted the system of <!--del_lnk--> Yoga and its disciplines as a direct means to attain <!--del_lnk--> moksha, rebutting the argument that it can be obtained through concentration of the mind. His position is that the mental states discovered through the practices of Yoga can be indirect aids to the gain of knowledge, but cannot themselves give rise to it. According to his philosophy, knowledge of <a href="../../wp/b/Brahman.htm" title="Brahman">Brahman</a> springs from inquiry into the words of the Upanishads, and the knowledge of <a href="../../wp/b/Brahman.htm" title="Brahman">Brahman</a> that <!--del_lnk--> shruti provides cannot be obtained in any other way. It has to be noted that it is generally considered that for Shankara the Absolute Reality is attributeless and impersonal, while for <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/r/Rigveda.htm" title="Venkata Madhava">Madhava</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Ramanuja, the Absolute Truth is <a href="../../wp/v/Vishnu.htm" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>. This has been a subject of debate, interpretation, and controversy since Shankara himself is attributed to composing the popular 8th century Hindu devotional composition <!--del_lnk--> Bhaja Govindam (literal meaning, "Worship Govinda"). This work of Adi Shankara is considered as a good summary of Advaita Vedanta and underscores the view that devotion to God, <!--del_lnk--> Govinda, is not only an important part of general spirituality, but the concluding verse drives through the message of Shankara: "Worship <!--del_lnk--> Govinda, worship <!--del_lnk--> Govinda, worship <!--del_lnk--> Govinda, Oh fool! Other than chanting the Lord's names, there is no other way to cross the life's ocean". <!--del_lnk--> Bhaja Govindam invokes the almighty in the aspect of Vishnu; it is therefore very popular not only with Sri Adi Shankaracharya's immediate followers, the <!--del_lnk--> Smarthas, but also with <!--del_lnk--> Vaishnavas and others.</p>
       <p>A well known verse, recited in the Smarta tradition, in praise of Adi Shankara is:</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Works">Works</span></h2>
       <p>Adi Shankara's works deal with logically establishing the doctrine of <!--del_lnk--> Advaita Vedanta as he saw it in the <!--del_lnk--> Upanishads. He formulates the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta by validating his arguments on the basis of quotations from the <!--del_lnk--> Vedas and other <!--del_lnk--> Hindu scriptures. He gives a high priority to <i>sv&#x101;nubhava</i> ("personal experience") of the student. His works are largely <!--del_lnk--> polemical in nature. He directs his polemics mostly against the <!--del_lnk--> Sankhya, <!--del_lnk--> Buddha, <!--del_lnk--> Jaina, <!--del_lnk--> Vaisheshika and other non-vedantic <!--del_lnk--> Hindu philosophies.</p>
       <p>Traditionally, his works are classified under <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Bh&#x101;&#x1E63;ya</span> ("commentary"), <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Prakara&#x1E47;a grantha</span> ("philosophical treatise") and Stotra ("devotional hymn"). The commentaries serve to provide a consistent interpretation of the scriptural texts from the perspective of Advaita Vedanta. The philosophical treatises provide various <!--del_lnk--> methodologies to the student to understand the doctrine. The devotional hymns are rich in poetry and piety, serving to highlight the relationship between the <!--del_lnk--> devotee and the <!--del_lnk--> deity.</p>
       <p>Adi Shankara wrote <i>Bhashyas</i> on the ten <!--del_lnk--> major <!--del_lnk--> Upanishads, the <!--del_lnk--> Brahma Sutras and the <!--del_lnk--> Bhagavad Gita. In his works, he quotes from Shveshvatara, Kaushitakai, Mahanarayana and Jabala Upanishads, among others. <i>Bhashyas</i> on Kaushitaki, Nrisimhatapani and Shveshvatara Upanishads are extant but the authenticity is doubtful. Adi Shankara's is the earliest extant commentary on the <!--del_lnk--> Brahma Sutras. However, he mentions older commentaries like those of Dravida, Bhartrprapancha and others.</p>
       <p>In his <!--del_lnk--> Brahma Sutra Bhashya, Adi Shankara cites the examples of Dharmavyadha, <!--del_lnk--> Vidura and others, who were born with the knowledge of <a href="../../wp/b/Brahman.htm" title="Brahman">Brahman</a> acquired in previous births. He mentions that the effects cannot be prevented from working on account of their present birth. He states that the knowledge that arises out of the study of the <!--del_lnk--> Vedas could be had through the <!--del_lnk--> Puranas and the <!--del_lnk--> Itihasas. In the <!--del_lnk--> Taittiriya Upanishad Bhashya 2.2, he says: {{quote<i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Sarve&#x15B;&#x101;&#x1E43; c&#x101;dhik&#x101;ro vidy&#x101;y&#x101;&#x1E43; ca &#x15B;reya&#x1E25; kevalay&#x101; vidy&#x101;y&#x101; veti siddha&#x1E43;</span></i> &ndash; It has been established that everyone has the right to the knowledge (of Brahman) and that the supreme goal is attained by that knowledge alone.}}</p>
       <p>Adi Shankara, in order to bring unity among various Hindu sects of those times, wrote five pancharathnam stotras for each of the following prime deities. The deities were <a href="../../wp/s/Shiva.htm" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vishnu.htm" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Shakti, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/g/Ganesha.htm" title="Ganesh">Ganesh</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Surya. The idea was that if you believed in Lord Shiva, you would chant Shiva pancharathnam stotra by placing Shiva's idol in the centre other four Hindu deities surrounding Him, two on each side. Similarly if you believed in Vishnu, you would place <a href="../../wp/v/Vishnu.htm" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> in the centre. Those five stotras are <!--del_lnk--> Ganesha pancharathnam and <!--del_lnk--> Lalitha pancharathnam.</p>
       <p>Some western academics consider only the <!--del_lnk--> Upade&#x15B;as&#x101;hasr&#x12B; as an authentic work of Shankara among the independent philosophical works. There is a difference of opinion among scholars on the authorship of <!--del_lnk--> Viveka Chudamani, though it is "so closely interwoven into the spiritual heritage of Shankara that any analysis of his perspective which fails to consider [this work] would be incomplete".</p>
       <p>Adi Shankara also wrote commentaries on other scriptural works, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Vishnu sahasran&#x101;ma and the <!--del_lnk--> S&#x101;natsuj&#x101;tiya. Like the <!--del_lnk--> Bhagavad Gita, both of these are contained in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mahabharata.htm" title="Mahabharata">Mahabh&#x101;rata</a>.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Film">Film</span></h2>
       <p>In 1983 a film directed by <!--del_lnk--> G. V. Iyer named <i><!--del_lnk--> Adi Shankaracharya</i> was premiered, the first film ever made entirely in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> language in which all of Adi Shankaracharya's works were compiled. The movie received the <!--del_lnk--> National Film Awards for <!--del_lnk--> Best Film, <!--del_lnk--> Best Screenplay, <!--del_lnk--> Best Cinematography and <!--del_lnk--> Best Audiography.</p>
