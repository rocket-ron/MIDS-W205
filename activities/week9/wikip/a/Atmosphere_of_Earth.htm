       <p><!--del_lnk--> Atmospheric science, or <b>aerology</b>, is the overall term for study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes; early pioneers in the field include <!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;on Teisserenc de Bort and <!--del_lnk--> Richard Assmann.</p>
       <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atmosphere_of_Earth.htm" title="Atmospheric stratification">Atmospheric stratification</a> describes the structure of the atmosphere, dividing it into distinct layers, each with specific characteristics such as temperature or composition. The atmosphere has a mass of about 5<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">&times;</span>10<sup>18</sup> kg, three quarters of which is within about 11&nbsp;km (6.8&nbsp;mi; 36,000&nbsp;ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing <!--del_lnk--> altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and <!--del_lnk--> outer space. An altitude of 120&nbsp;km (75&nbsp;mi) is where atmospheric effects become noticeable during <!--del_lnk--> atmospheric reentry of spacecraft. The <!--del_lnk--> K&aacute;rm&aacute;n line, at 100&nbsp;km (62&nbsp;mi), also is often regarded as the boundary between atmosphere and outer space. This altitude amounts to 1.57% of the Earth's radius.</p>
       <p><b>Air</b> is the name given to the atmosphere used in <!--del_lnk--> breathing and <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>.

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Principal_layers">Principal layers</span></h3>
       <p>In general, air pressure and density decrease in the atmosphere as height increases. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the <a href="../../wp/a/Atmosphere_of_Earth.htm#Temperature_and_speed_of_sound" title="Atmosphere of Earth">temperature</a> section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile is constant and recognizable through means such as <!--del_lnk--> balloon soundings, the temperature behaviour provides a useful metric to distinguish between atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. From highest to lowest, these layers are:</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Exosphere">Exosphere</span></h4>
       <p>The outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere extends from the <!--del_lnk--> exobase upward. It is mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. The particles are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Since the particles rarely collide, the atmosphere no longer behaves like a fluid. These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate into and out of the <!--del_lnk--> magnetosphere or the <!--del_lnk--> solar wind.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Thermosphere">Thermosphere</span></h4>
       <div class="floatright"><a class="image" href="../../images/1691/169165.png.htm" title="Layers of the atmosphere drawn to scale. Objects within the layers are not to scale."><img alt="Layers of the atmosphere drawn to scale. Objects within the layers are not to scale." height="700" src="../../images/1691/169165.png"  width="430" /></a></div>
       <p>Temperature increases with height in the thermosphere from the mesopause up to the <!--del_lnk--> thermopause, then is constant with height. Unlike in the stratosphere, where the inversion is caused by absorption of radiation by ozone, in the thermosphere the inversion is a result of the extremely low density of molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">1,500 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(2,700&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, though the gas molecules are so far apart that <!--del_lnk--> temperature in the usual sense is not well defined. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, for example) travels an average of 1 kilometer between collisions with other molecules. The <a href="../../wp/i/International_Space_Station.htm" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a> orbits in this layer, between 320 and 380 km (200 and 240 mi). Because of the relative infrequency of molecular collisions, air above the mesopause is poorly mixed compared with air below. While the composition from the troposphere to the mesosphere is fairly constant, above a certain point, air is poorly mixed and becomes compositionally stratified. The point dividing these two regions is known as the <!--del_lnk--> turbopause. The region below is the homosphere, and the region above is the heterosphere. The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the <!--del_lnk--> exobase. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about 350&ndash;800&nbsp;km (220&ndash;500&nbsp;mi; 1,100,000&ndash;2,600,000&nbsp;ft).</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mesosphere">Mesosphere</span></h4>
       <p>The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to 80&ndash;85&nbsp;km (50&ndash;53&nbsp;mi; 260,000&ndash;280,000&nbsp;ft). It is the layer where most <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Meteoroid.htm" title="Meteor">meteors</a> burn up upon entering the atmosphere. Temperature decreases with height in the mesosphere. The <!--del_lnk--> mesopause, the temperature minimum that marks the top of the mesosphere, is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around &minus;85&nbsp;<a href="../../wp/c/Celsius.htm" title="Celsius">&deg;C</a> (&minus;120&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;F; 190&nbsp;<a href="../../wp/k/Kelvin.htm" title="Kelvin">K</a>). At the <!--del_lnk--> mesopause, temperatures may drop to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;100 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(&minus;150&nbsp;&deg;F; 170&nbsp;K)</span>. Due to the cold temperature of the mesosphere, water vapor is frozen, forming ice clouds (or <!--del_lnk--> Noctilucent clouds). A type of lightning referred to as either <!--del_lnk--> sprites or <!--del_lnk--> ELVES, form many miles above thunderclouds in the troposphere.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stratosphere">Stratosphere</span></h4>
       <p>The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about 51&nbsp;km (32&nbsp;mi; 170,000&nbsp;ft). Temperature increases with height due to increased absorption of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a> by the <!--del_lnk--> ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. While the temperature may be <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&minus;60 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(&minus;76&nbsp;&deg;F; 210&nbsp;K)</span> at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near freezing. The <!--del_lnk--> stratopause, which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at 50 to 55 km (31 to 34 mi; 160,000 to 180,000 ft). The pressure here is 1/1000 <!--del_lnk--> sea level.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Troposphere">Troposphere</span></h4>
       <p>The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between 9&nbsp;km (30,000&nbsp;ft) at the poles and 17&nbsp;km (56,000&nbsp;ft) at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. This promotes vertical mixing (hence the origin of its name in the Greek word "&tau;&rho;&omicron;&pi;&#x3AE;", <i>trope</i>, meaning turn or overturn). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the mass of the atmosphere. The <!--del_lnk--> tropopause is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_layers">Other layers</span></h3>
       <p>Within the five principal layers determined by temperature are several layers determined by other properties:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer <a href="../../wp/o/Ozone.htm" title="Ozone">ozone</a> concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about 15&ndash;35&nbsp;km (9.3&ndash;22&nbsp;mi; 49,000&ndash;110,000&nbsp;ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> ionosphere, the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from 50 to 1,000 km (31 to 620 mi; 160,000 to 3,300,000 ft) and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere. It has practical importance because it influences, for example, <a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio</a> propagation on the Earth. It is responsible for <!--del_lnk--> auroras.</li>
        <li>The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. In the homosphere the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. Above the <i><!--del_lnk--> turbopause</i> at about 100&nbsp;km (62&nbsp;mi; 330,000&nbsp;ft) (essentially corresponding to the mesopause), the composition varies with altitude. This is because the <!--del_lnk--> distance that particles can move without colliding with one another is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones such as oxygen and nitrogen present only near the bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.</li>
        <li>The <!--del_lnk--> planetary boundary layer is the part of the troposphere that is nearest the Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through <!--del_lnk--> turbulent diffusion. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well-mixed, while at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about 100 m on clear, calm nights to 3000 m or more during the afternoon in dry regions.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The average temperature of the atmosphere at the surface of Earth is <span style="white-space:nowrap;">14 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(57&nbsp;&deg;F; 287&nbsp;K)</span> or <span style="white-space:nowrap;">15 &deg;C</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(59&nbsp;&deg;F; 288&nbsp;K)</span>, depending on the reference.</p>

Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and <!--del_lnk--> weather.</p>
       <p>If the atmosphere had a uniform density, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50&nbsp;km (27,900&nbsp;ft). It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6&nbsp;km (18,000&nbsp;ft) or by a factor of 1/<!--del_lnk--> e every 7.64&nbsp;km (25,100&nbsp;ft), the average <!--del_lnk--> scale height of the atmosphere below 70&nbsp;km (43&nbsp;mi; 230,000&nbsp;ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.</p>
       <p>In summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>50% is below 5.6&nbsp;km (18,000&nbsp;ft).</li>
        <li>90% is below 16&nbsp;km (52,000&nbsp;ft).</li>
        <li>99.99997% is below 100&nbsp;km (62&nbsp;mi; 330,000&nbsp;ft), the <!--del_lnk--> K&aacute;rm&aacute;n line. By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered <!--del_lnk--> astronauts.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>By comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at 8,848&nbsp;m (29,029&nbsp;ft); commercial <!--del_lnk--> airliners typically cruise between 10&nbsp;km (33,000&nbsp;ft) and 13&nbsp;km (43,000&nbsp;ft) where the thinner air improves fuel economy; <!--del_lnk--> weather balloons reach 30.4&nbsp;km (100,000&nbsp;ft) and above; and the highest <!--del_lnk--> X-15 flight in 1963 reached 108.0&nbsp;km (354,300&nbsp;ft).</p>
       <p>Even above the K&aacute;rm&aacute;n line, significant atmospheric effects such as <!--del_lnk--> auroras still occur. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Meteoroid.htm" title="Meteors">Meteors</a> begin to glow in this region though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's <!--del_lnk--> ionosphere, important to <!--del_lnk--> HF radio propagation, begin below 100&nbsp;km and extend beyond 500&nbsp;km. By comparison, the <a href="../../wp/i/International_Space_Station.htm" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Space Shuttle typically orbit at 350&ndash;400&nbsp;km, within the <!--del_lnk--> F-layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough <!--del_lnk--> atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can still experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700&ndash;800&nbsp;km.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Temperature_and_speed_of_sound">Temperature and speed of sound</span></h3>
       <p>The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11&nbsp;km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the <!--del_lnk--> stratosphere, starting above about 20&nbsp;km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the <!--del_lnk--> ozone layer caused by capture of significant <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> radiation from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named <!--del_lnk--> thermosphere above 90&nbsp;km.</p>
       <p>Because in an <!--del_lnk--> ideal gas of constant composition the <!--del_lnk--> speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.</p>

       </div>
       <p>The density of air at sea level is about 1.2 &nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> (1.2 g/L). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the <!--del_lnk--> ideal gas law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the <!--del_lnk--> barometric formula.

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Optical_properties">Optical properties</span></h2>
       <p>Solar <!--del_lnk--> radiation (or sunlight) is the energy the Earth receives from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>. The Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scattering">Scattering</span></h3>
       <p>When light passes through our atmosphere, <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photons</a> interact with it through <i>scattering</i>. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called <i>direct radiation</i> and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. <i>Indirect radiation</i> is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an <!--del_lnk--> overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called <!--del_lnk--> Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why <!--del_lnk--> sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Absorption">Absorption</span></h3>
       <p>Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 <!--del_lnk--> nanometers. Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700&nbsp;nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. We can think of this as heating the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.</p>
       <div class="thumb tleft">
        <div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a class="image" href="../../images/1494/149471.png.htm"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" height="104" src="../../images/1691/169183.png"  width="220" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The combined <!--del_lnk--> absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave "windows" of low <!--del_lnk--> opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The <!--del_lnk--> optical window runs from around 300&nbsp;nm (<a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>-C) up into the range humans can see, the <!--del_lnk--> visible spectrum (commonly called <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a>), at roughly 400&ndash;700&nbsp;nm and continues to the <!--del_lnk--> infrared to around 1100&nbsp;nm. There are also <!--del_lnk--> infrared and <!--del_lnk--> radio windows that transmit some infrared and <!--del_lnk--> radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Emission">Emission</span></h3>
       <p><i>Emission</i> is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their "<!--del_lnk--> black body" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately 6,000&nbsp;<a href="../../wp/k/Kelvin.htm" title="Kelvin">K</a> (5,730&nbsp;<a href="../../wp/c/Celsius.htm" title="Celsius">&deg;C</a>; 10,340&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;F), its radiation peaks near 500&nbsp;nm, and is visible to the human eye. The Earth is approximately <span style="white-space:nowrap;">290 K</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(17&nbsp;&deg;C; 62&nbsp;&deg;F)</span>, so its radiation peaks near 10,000&nbsp;nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.</p>
       <p>Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights the Earth's surface cools down faster than on <a href="../../wp/c/Cloud.htm" title="Cloud">cloudy</a> nights. This is because clouds (H<sub>2</sub>O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_effect.htm" title="Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a> is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Refractive_index">Refractive index</span></h3>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the <!--del_lnk--> horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the <!--del_lnk--> curvature of the Earth's surface.</p>
       <p>The refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the <!--del_lnk--> mirage.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Second_atmosphere">Second atmosphere</span></h3>
       <p>The next atmosphere, consisting largely of <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> plus <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and inert gases, was produced by outgassing from <!--del_lnk--> volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the <!--del_lnk--> late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Asteroid.htm" title="Asteroids">asteroids</a>. A major rainfall led to the buildup of a vast ocean. A major part of carbon dioxide exhalations were soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments.</p>
       <p>Water-related sediments have been found dating from as early as 3.8 billion years ago. About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen was the major part of the then stable "second atmosphere". An influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, since hints of early life forms are to be found as early as 3.5 billion years ago. The fact that this is not perfectly in line with the 30% lower solar radiance (compared to today) of the early Sun has been described as the "<!--del_lnk--> faint young Sun paradox".</p>
       <p>The geological record however shows a continually relatively warm surface during the complete early <!--del_lnk--> temperature record of the Earth with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late <!--del_lnk--> Archaean eon an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently from photosynthesizing algae (see <!--del_lnk--> Great Oxygenation Event) which have been found as <!--del_lnk--> stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) is very much in line with what is found today, suggesting that the fundamental features of the <!--del_lnk--> carbon cycle were established as early as 4 billion years ago.</p>

       <p>The accretion of continents about 3.5 billion years ago added <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a>, constantly rearranging the continents and also shaping long-term climate evolution by allowing the transfer of carbon dioxide to large land-based carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist until about 1.7 billion years ago and this can be seen with the development of the red beds and the end of the banded iron formations. The Earth had a lot of iron in the beginning, and higher amounts of oxygen was not available in the atmosphere until all the iron had been oxidized. This signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O<sub>2</sub> showed major ups and downs until reaching a steady state of more than 15%. The following time span was the <!--del_lnk--> Phanerozoic eon, during which oxygen-breathing <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Metazoan">metazoan</a> life forms began to appear.</p>
       <p>The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has gone up and down during the last 600 million years. There was a peak 280 million years ago, when the amount of oxygen was about 30%, much higher than today. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants converts carbon dioxide into the bodies of the plants, which emits oxygen into the atmosphere, and break down of pyrite rocks cause sulphur to be added to the oceans. Volcanos cause this sulphur to be oxidized, reducing the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. But volcanos also emit carbon dioxide, so that plants can convert this to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are believed to cause rapid development of animals. Even though the atmosphere today has only 21 percent oxygen, today is still regarded as a period with rapid development of animals because of a high amount of oxygen in the atmosphere.</p>

The troposphere ends abruptly at the tropopause, which appears in the image as the sharp boundary between the orange- and blue- coloured atmosphere. The silvery-blue <!--del_lnk--> noctilucent clouds extend far above the Earth's troposphere.&nbsp;</div>
