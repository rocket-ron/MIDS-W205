<h3>AIDS in Africa: Helping HIV/AIDS Orphans</h3>
<img class="image-right" src="../../wp/c/Clip_image001.jpg" alt="clip_image001" />
<p><strong>AIDS in Africa</strong> continues to have a devastating effect, especially for children who are orphaned or lose siblings to the disease. The tragedy of <strong>AIDS in Africa </strong>may be something we are becoming more aware as a global society, but much more needs to be done to stop this terrible disease destroying lives.</p>
<p>SOS Children has grassroots projects in most countries in Africa&nbsp;
 working at a simple level giving practical support to children. Last 
year, thanks to people like you, SOS Children supported more than a hundred thousand <a class="internal" href="../../wp/o/Our_Strategy.htm">AIDS Orphans</a>
 in their old family home in 44 countries through three visits a week 
with practical help, food, medicine and love. Children are saved one by 
one and every contribution or small regular donation helps us to help another child.</p>
<p>However, there is so much more to do stem the flow of <strong>AIDS in Africa</strong>&#x2026;</p>
<h2>AIDS in Africa background</h2>
<div>
<p>There is an epidemic of AIDS in Africa,
 especially sub-Saharan Africa. In some African countries it is 
estimated that 40% of the working-age population has contracted HIV, 
with younger and more successful workers being most likely to be 
affected. However, this is never uniform across a population; 40% of a 
whole African country will mean there are areas where virtually everyone
 has contracted HIV / AIDS. The worst affected countries include Swaziland, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Lesotho. In places like these, village after village has no young adults left. AIDS in Africa is engulfing communities, and the magnitude of the problem is overwhelming</p>
<p>It is hard to know how to approach such a situation. SOS Children has developed a <a class="internal" href="../../wp/o/Our_Strategy.htm">strategy for AIDS orphans in Africa </a>where we do not move children from their familiar background but strengthen their community
 to look after them. SOS has projects helping more than a hundred thousand African 
children orphaned by AIDS in 45 African countries, and is growing as 
fast as you allow us to. We are continually improving our approach with 
the exchange of experience and best practice. Details of more 
established projects, such as all our Children's Villages in Africa can 
be found on our <a title="Sponsor a Child in Africa" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/a/Africa_F.htm">Africa Pages</a>. <img class="image-right" src="../../wp/c/Clip_image0011.jpg" alt="Family Strengthening Programme in Bakoteh" /></p>
<p>Inevitably many of those affected by AIDS in Africa are the parents of young children. 
When parents suffering from AIDS begin to deteriotate, they cannot work and need
 to be looked after. But the situation is so bad that in parts of Africa
 no adults are able to help. The children not only have the distress of 
seeing their parents become weaker and weaker but they no longer have 
anyone providing for them and often have to try to help care for their 
parents. It is not unusual to find very young children or some of their 
brothers and sisters with AIDS (about half of all children of 
HIV-affected African mothers end up with AIDS themselves), orphaned and 
caring for toddlers. It is estimated that 90% of the world&#x2019;s 
HIV-infected children live on the continent , and more than half a million die 
of AIDS in Africa each year.</p>
<p>You can read here about a <a class="internal" href="http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/about-our-charity/archive/2009/04/child-family-zimbabwe">child-headed family</a> and how SOS Children is supporting them.</p>
<h2>AIDS in Africa: the way forward?</h2>
<img class="image-right" src="../../wp/g/Guinea1.jpg" alt="Girl from Family Strengthening Programme in Guinea" />
<p>So is this a hopeless situation? No, it is tragic but not hopeless. 
At present, for those infected with AIDS in Africa, all we can try to ensure 
is that they are loved and cared for as they grow weaker. For the many 
young children in Africa who do not have HIV / AIDS, we can make a huge 
difference. The difference between love and abandonment, between a group
 of young children scavenging for scraps and a small child-led family 
with adequate nourishment and even the chance of school.</p>

<h2>AIDS: Only affecting Africa?</h2>
<p>It is true that the most children orphaned and affected by AIDS live 
in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, as the infection spreads, the number of 
children who are living with HIV-infected parents and who have lost 
parents to AIDS is beginning to grow in other regions, including Asia, 
Latin America and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>For example, Russia has the fastest growing HIV rates in the world, 
with 100 new infections every day. Russia accounts for around two-thirds
 of the cases in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region. There were 
an estimated 940,000 people living with HIV at the end of 2005 in Russia
 - up from 760,000 in 2003 - and this figure looks set to increase even 
further. Some 20 babies are born every day to HIV-positive women, with 
two of those, on average, abandoned by their mothers. Read here about
