       <p><b>Archaeoastronomy</b> (also spelled <b>archeoastronomy</b>) is the study of how people in the past "have understood the <!--del_lnk--> phenomena in the <!--del_lnk--> sky, how they used phenomena in the sky, and what role the sky played in their <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">cultures</a>." <!--del_lnk--> Clive Ruggles argues it is misleading to consider archaeoastronomy to be the study of ancient <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, as modern astronomy is a scientific discipline, while archaeoastronomy considers symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky by other cultures. It is often twinned with <i>ethnoastronomy</i>, the <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropological</a> study of skywatching in contemporary societies. Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with <!--del_lnk--> historical astronomy, the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the <!--del_lnk--> history of astronomy, which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.</p>
       <p>Archaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, the problem of integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term issue for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in <!--del_lnk--> landscape archaeology and <!--del_lnk--> cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into <!--del_lnk--> beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as <a href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm#Astronomy" title="Maya civilization">Mayan astronomy</a> and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.</p>
       <p>Archaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs. It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as: <i>"...[A] field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other."</i></p>

       <p>Two hundred years before Michell wrote the above, there were no archaeoastronomers and there were no <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm#History_of_archaeology" title="Archaeology">professional archaeologists</a>, but there were astronomers and <!--del_lnk--> antiquarians. Some of their works are considered <!--del_lnk--> precursors of archaeoastronomy; antiquarians interpreted the astronomical orientation of the ruins that dotted the English countryside as <!--del_lnk--> William Stukeley did of <a href="../../wp/s/Stonehenge.htm" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> in 1740, while <!--del_lnk--> John Aubrey in 1678 and <!--del_lnk--> Henry Chauncy in 1700 sought similar astronomical principles underlying the orientation of churches. Late in the nineteenth century astronomers such as <!--del_lnk--> Richard Proctor and <!--del_lnk--> Charles Piazzi Smyth investigated the astronomical orientations of <a href="../../wp/e/Egyptian_pyramids.htm" title="Egyptian pyramids">the pyramids</a>.</p>
       <p>The term <i>archaeoastronomy</i> was first used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (at the suggestion of Euan MacKie) in 1973, but as a topic of study it may be much older, depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined. Clive Ruggles says that <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Nissen, working in the mid-nineteenth century was arguably the first archaeoastronomer. Rolf Sinclair says that <!--del_lnk--> Norman Lockyer, working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be called the 'father of archaeoastronomy.' Euan MacKie would place the origin even later, stating: "...the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Thom in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s."</p>

       <p>In the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Gerald Hawkins, who proposed that <a href="../../wp/s/Stonehenge.htm" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> was a <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic computer, inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites. The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed, but this was not the case for Alexander Thom's work, whose survey results of <!--del_lnk--> megalithic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles. Euan MacKie, recognizing that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate <!--del_lnk--> winter solstice site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon <!--del_lnk--> stone circle in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain. In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence. Nevertheless Thom's legacy remains strong, Krupp wrote in 1979, "Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo-astronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades." His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.</p>

       <p>The approach in the <!--del_lnk--> New World, where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the <!--del_lnk--> prehistory of Europe lacks such as <!--del_lnk--> ethnographies and the historical records of the early <!--del_lnk--> colonizers. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni, this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak when compared to the statistically led investigations in Europe.</p>
       <p>This came to a head at a meeting sponsored by the <!--del_lnk--> IAU in <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> in 1981. The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.</p>

       </blockquote>
       <p>Archaeoastronomy has long been seen as an interdisciplinary field that uses written and unwritten evidence to study the astronomies of other cultures. As such, it can be seen as connecting other disciplinary approaches for investigating ancient astronomy: astroarchaeology (an obsolete term for studies that draw astronomical information from the alignments of ancient architecture and landscapes), <!--del_lnk--> history of astronomy (which deals primarily with the written textual evidence), and ethnoastronomy (which draws on the ethnohistorical record and contemporary ethnographic studies).</p>
       <p>Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's development as an interdisciplinary subject, research in the field is conducted by investigators trained in a wide range of disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.</p>
       <p>Both practicing archaeoastronomers and observers of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy as part of an archaeology informed by <!--del_lnk--> cultural anthropology and aimed at understanding a "group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology. Todd Bostwick argued that "archaeoastronomy is anthropology &ndash; the study of human behaviour in the past and present." <!--del_lnk--> Paul Bahn has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology. Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations or as it relates to the political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques. Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing "the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism" Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable <!--del_lnk--> precursors of their discipline, and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.</p>
       <p>The reactions of professional archaeologists to archaeoastronomy have been decidedly mixed. Some expressed incomprehension or even hostility, varying from a rejection by the archaeological mainstream of what they saw as an archaeoastronomical fringe to an incomprehension between the cultural focus of archaeologists and the quantitative focus of early archaeoastronomers. Yet archaeologists have increasingly come to incorporate many of the insights from archaeoastronomy into archaeology textbooks and, as mentioned above, some students wrote archaeology dissertations on archaeoastronomical topics.</p>
       <p>Since archaeoastronomers disagree so widely on the characterization of the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy to the study of culture, using the term <i>Astronomy in Culture</i> or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees an important part of the discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline <i>Archaeotopography.</i> Ruggles and Saunders proposed <i>Cultural Astronomy</i> as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmology.htm" title="Cosmology">cosmologies</a> and people who object to the use of <!--del_lnk--> logos have suggested adopting the Spanish <i>cosmovisi&oacute;n</i>.</p>
       <p>When debates polarise between techniques, the methods are often referred to by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished. Green (<!--del_lnk--> Old World) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of what is a social practice. Brown (<!--del_lnk--> New World) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and have been described as 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis. Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.</p>

       <p>There is no one way to do Archaeoastronomy. The divisions between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Green_archaeoastronomy">Green archaeoastronomy</span></h3>
       <p>Green Archaeoastronomy is named after the cover of the book <i>Archaeoastronomy in the Old World</i>. It is based primarily on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively scant compared to the historic period. The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.</p>
       <p>Thom wished to examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He believed that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge on the other side for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a <!--del_lnk--> hypothetical site, one the day before the <!--del_lnk--> summer solstice and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset. Horizon astronomy is arguably inaccurate, due to variations in refraction.</p>
       <center>
       </center>
       <p>To test this idea he surveyed hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but he planned to show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing that there was an astronomical intent to the orientation of at least some of the alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two <!--del_lnk--> solstices, the two <!--del_lnk--> equinoxes and four <!--del_lnk--> cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.</p>
       <p>Euan MacKie has supported Thom's analysis, to which he added an archaeological context by comparing Neolithic Britain to the Mayan civilization to argue for a stratified society in this period. To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. Kintraw is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed that this was a foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on Jura. This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at <!--del_lnk--> Maes Howe and on the <!--del_lnk--> Bush Barrow Lozenge led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.</p>
       <p>In contrast Clive Ruggles has argued that there are problems with the selection of data in Thom's surveys. A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer <i>whether</i> there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer <i>why</i> people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn&rsquo;t inform the current interpretive questions." Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Brown_archaeoastronomy">Brown archaeoastronomy</span></h3>
       <p>In contrast to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy has been identified as being closer to the <!--del_lnk--> history of astronomy or to <!--del_lnk--> cultural history, insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual. The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.</p>
       <p>One famous site where historical records have been used to interpret sites is <!--del_lnk--> Chichen Itza. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the <a href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm" title="Maya civilization">Mayans</a> and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet <a href="../../wp/v/Venus.htm" title="Venus">Venus</a>. This interest is attested to by the <!--del_lnk--> Dresden codex which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky. These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with <a href="../../wp/q/Quetzalcoatl.htm" title="Quetzalcoatl">Quetzalcoatl</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Xolotl. Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The Temple of the Warriors bears iconography depicting feathered serpents associated with Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This means that the building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it coincides with the rainy season) may be meaningful. Aveni claims that another building associated with the planet Venus in the form of Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the <!--del_lnk--> Caracol. This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star. However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.</p>
       <p>Aveni states that one of the strengths of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Incas</a> as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using <i>ceques</i> radial routes emanating from the capital at <!--del_lnk--> Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the <!--del_lnk--> Han dynasty, in the second century BC.</p>
       <p>A criticism of this method is that it can be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies are more likely to be considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like <!--del_lnk--> analogy and <!--del_lnk--> homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy.</p>

       <p>To calculate what astronomical features a structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If you were to go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90&deg; if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or &minus;90&deg; if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as <i>declination</i>. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0&deg;. The visible declinations vary depending where you are on the globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.</p>

If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5&deg; then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice.

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lunar_positioning">Lunar positioning</span></h3>
       <p>The Moon's appearance is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits &mdash; known as <!--del_lnk--> <i>luna</i>stices rather than <i>sol</i>stices. However, its travel between lunastices is considerably faster. It takes a <!--del_lnk--> sidereal month to complete its cycle rather than the year long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunastices marking the limits of the Moon's movement move on <!--del_lnk--> an 18.6 year cycle. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the <i><!--del_lnk--> phase</i> of the Moon. The cycle from one <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/New_moon.htm" title="New Moon">New Moon</a> to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the <!--del_lnk--> Synodic month. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a> for more details.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Finally there is often a need to correct for the apparent movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a <!--del_lnk--> spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around <!--del_lnk--> Polaris as they do now. In the case of the <a href="../../wp/e/Egyptian_pyramids.htm" title="Egyptian pyramids">Egyptian pyramids</a>, it has been shown they were aligned towards <!--del_lnk--> Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of <!--del_lnk--> Draco. The effect can be substanstial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation <!--del_lnk--> Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in <!--del_lnk--> Sagittarius due to the <!--del_lnk--> precession of the equinoxes.</p>

       <p>Additionally there are often transient phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like <!--del_lnk--> eclipses. In the case of <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_eclipse.htm" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipses</a> these can be used to date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> enables us to date a battle between the <!--del_lnk--> Medes and the <!--del_lnk--> Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Supernova.htm" title="Supernovae">supernovae</a> whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.</p>

       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_use_of_calendars">The use of calendars</span></h3>
       <p>A common justification for the need for astronomy is the need to develop an accurate <!--del_lnk--> calendar for <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> reasons. Ancient texts like <!--del_lnk--> Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecological</a> signs, such as <a href="../../wp/b/Bird_migration.htm" title="Bird migration">bird migrations</a> to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the <!--del_lnk--> Mursi of <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times in some parts of the world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.</p>
       <p>An example of a non-agricultural calendar is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Tzolk'in</i> calendar of the <a href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm" title="Maya civilization">Maya civilization</a> of <!--del_lnk--> pre-Columbian <!--del_lnk--> Mesoamerica, which is a cycle of 260 days. This count is based on an <!--del_lnk--> earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica. This formed part of a more comprehensive system of <!--del_lnk--> Maya calendars which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.</p>
       <p>Other peculiar calendars include ancient <!--del_lnk--> Greek calendars. These were nominally <!--del_lnk--> lunar, starting with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/New_moon.htm" title="New Moon">New Moon</a>. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and <i>ton theoi</i>, by the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">moon</a>. The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as <!--del_lnk--> games or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism may have been used as a politically neutral form of timekeeping.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>Another motive for studying the sky is to understand and explain the <a href="../../wp/u/Universe.htm" title="Universe">universe</a>. In these cultures <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">myth</a> was a tool for achieving this and the explanations, while not reflecting the standards of modern <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a>, are <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmology.htm" title="Cosmology">cosmologies</a>.</p>
       <p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Incas</a> arranged their empire to demonstrate their cosmology. The capital, <!--del_lnk--> Cusco, was at the centre of the empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre. These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four <i>suyus</i>, which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a>. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> in the night sky. In one season it will bisect the sky and in another bisect it in a <!--del_lnk--> perpendicular fashion.</p>
       <p>The importance of observing cosmological factors is also seen on the other side of the world. The <!--del_lnk--> Forbidden City in <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions the Chinese saw five, <!--del_lnk--> North, <!--del_lnk--> South, <!--del_lnk--> East, <!--del_lnk--> West and <!--del_lnk--> Centre. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing. One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing him in front of the <!--del_lnk--> circumpolar stars. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as <!--del_lnk--> Feng Shui.</p>
       <p>There is also much information about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the <!--del_lnk--> constellations. The Barasana of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Amazon_rainforest.htm" title="Amazon Rainforest">Amazon</a> plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.</p>
       <p>A more well-known source of constellation myth are the texts of the Greeks and Romans. The origin of their constellations remains a matter of vigorous and occasionally fractious debate.</p>
       <p>The loss of one of the sisters, Merope, in some Greek myths may reflect an astronomical event wherein one of the stars in the Pleiades disappeared from view by the naked eye.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Giorgio de Santillana, professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with Hertha von Dechend believed that the old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmology.htm" title="Cosmology">cosmology</a> clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters and violence in ancient myths are representative of the forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> that became lost with the rise of the Greco-Roman civilization. Santillana and von Dechend in their book <i>Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time</i> (1969) clearly state that ancient myths have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the <!--del_lnk--> precession of the equinoxes. Santillana and von Dechend's approach is not widely accepted.</p>

       <p>By including celestial motifs in clothing it becomes possible for the wearer to make claims the power on Earth is drawn from above. It has been said that the Shield of <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles.htm" title="Achilles">Achilles</a> described by <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a> is also a catalogue of constellations. In North America shields depicted in <!--del_lnk--> Comanche <!--del_lnk--> petroglyphs appear to include Venus symbolism.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Solsticial alignments also can be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Titicaca.htm#Isla_del_Sol" title="Lake Titicaca">Island of the Sun</a> (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Titicaca.htm" title="Lake Titicaca">Lake Titicaca</a>, the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Inca</a> ruling elite. Ordinary <!--del_lnk--> pilgrims stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.</p>
       <p>In Egypt the temple of <!--del_lnk--> Amun-Re at <!--del_lnk--> Karnak has been the subject of much study. Evaluation of the site, taking into account the change over time of the <!--del_lnk--> obliquity of the ecliptic show that the Great Temple was aligned on the rising of the midwinter sun. The length of the corridor down which sunlight would travel would have limited illumination at other times of the year.</p>
       <p>In a later period the <!--del_lnk--> Serapeum in <a href="../../wp/a/Alexandria.htm" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> was also said to have contained a <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">solar</a> alignment so that, on a specific sunrise, a shaft of light would pass across the lips of the statue of <!--del_lnk--> Serapis thus symbolising the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> saluting the god.</p>

       <p>Newgrange is a passage tomb in the Republic of Ireland dating from around 3,300 to 2,900 BC For a few days around the Winter Solstice light shines along the central passageway into the heart of the tomb. What makes this notable is not that light shines in the passageway, but that it does not do so through the main entrance. Instead it enters via a hollow box above the main doorway discovered by Michael O'Kelly. It is this roofbox which strongly indicates that the tomb was built with an astronomical aspect in mind.

       <p>Many astronomical alignments have been claimed for Stonehenge, a complex of <!--del_lnk--> megaliths and <!--del_lnk--> earthworks in the <!--del_lnk--> Salisbury Plain of England. The most famous of these is the midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.</p>
       <p>As well as solar alignments, there are proposed lunar alignments. The four station stones mark out a rectangle. The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. The long sides if viewed towards the south-east, face the most southerly rising of the moon. Aveni notes that these lunar alignments have never gained the acceptance that the solar alignments have received. Jacobs noted the Heel Stone azimuth is one-seventh of circumference, matching the latitude of Avebury, while summer solstice sunrise azimuth is no longer equal to the construction era direction.</p>

In the 1990s further investigations were carried out to discover whether this was an accurate or an approximate solar alignment. Several new aspects of the site were discovered. In the first place the entrance passage faces the hills of the island <!--del_lnk--> Hoy, about 10 miles away. Secondly, it consists of two straight lengths, angled at a few degrees to each other. Thirdly, the outer part is aligned towards the midwinter sunset position on a level horizon just to the left of Ward Hill on Hoy. Fourthly the inner part points directly at the Barnhouse standing stone about 400m away and then to the right end of the summit of Ward Hill, just before it dips down to the notch between it at Cuilags to the right. This indicated line points to sunset on the first Sixteenths of the solar year (according to A. Thom) before and after the winter solstice and the notch at the base of the right slope of the Hill is at the same declination. Fourthly a similar 'double sunset' phenomenon is seen at the right end of Cuilags, also on Hoy; here the date is the first Eighth of the year before and after the winter solstice, at the beginning of November and February respectively &ndash; the Old Celtic festivals of <!--del_lnk--> Samhain and <!--del_lnk--> Imbolc. This alignment is not indicated by an artificial structure but gains plausibility from the other two indicated lines. Maeshowe is thus an extremely sophisticated calendar site which must have been positioned carefully in order to use the horizon foresights in the ways described.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Uxmal is a Mayan city in the Puuc Hills of <!--del_lnk--> Yucat&aacute;n, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal is often used as an exemplar of why it is important to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an <!--del_lnk--> azimuth of 118&deg; on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment is also towards a southerly rising of Venus which occurs once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius <i>et cetera</i>? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards the rising of Venus, it is also covered in <!--del_lnk--> glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. It is the combination of the alignment and the ethnography which suggests that the city was built with cosmic order in mind.</p>

       </div>
       <p>In Chaco Canyon, the center of the ancient Pueblo culture in the American Southwest, numerous solar and lunar light markings and architectural and road alignments have been documented. These findings date to the 1977 discovery of the Sun Dagger site by Anna Sofaer. Three large stone slabs leaning against a cliff channel light and shadow markings onto two spiral petroglyphs on the cliff wall, marking the solstices, equinoxes and the lunar standstills of the 18.6 year cycle of the moon. Subsequent research by the Solstice Project and others demonstrated that numerous building and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon are oriented to solar, lunar and cardinal directions. In addition, research shows that the Great North Road, a thirty-five mile engineered &ldquo;road&rdquo;, was constructed not for utilitarian purposes but rather to connect the ceremonial centre of Chaco Canyon with the direction north.</p>

       <p>Archaeoastronomy owes something of this poor reputation among scholars to its occasional misuse to advance a range of <!--del_lnk--> pseudo-historical accounts. During the 1930s Otto S. Reuter compiled a study entitled <i>Germanische Himmelskunde</i>, or "Teutonic Skylore". The astronomical orientations of ancient monuments claimed by Reuter and his followers would place the ancient Germanic peoples ahead of the <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Near East in the field of astronomy, demonstrating the intellectual superiority of the "<!--del_lnk--> Aryans" (Indo-Europeans) over the <!--del_lnk--> Semites.</p>
       <p>Since the Nineteenth Century numerous scholars have sought to use <!--del_lnk--> archaeoastronomical calculations to demonstrate the antiquity of Ancient Indian Vedic culture, computing the dates of astronomical observations ambiguously described in ancient poetry to as early as 4000 BCE. <!--del_lnk--> David Pingree, a historian of Indian astronomy, condemned "the scholars who perpetrate wild theories of prehistoric science and call themselves archaeoastronomers."</p>
       <p>More recently Gallagher, Pyle, and <!--del_lnk--> Fell interpreted inscriptions in West Virginia as a description in Celtic <!--del_lnk--> Ogham alphabet of the supposed winter solstitial marker at the site. The controversial translation was supposedly validated by a problematic archaeoastronomical indication in which the winter solstice sun shone on an inscription of the sun at the site. Subsequent analyses criticized its cultural inappropriateness, as well as its linguistic and archeaoastronomical claims, to describe it as an example of "<!--del_lnk--> cult archaeology".</p>
       <p>Archaeoastronomy has helped to dispel the pseudoscientific <!--del_lnk--> ancient astronauts theories that were put forward by <!--del_lnk--> Erich von D&auml;niken. For example, D&auml;niken speculated that ancient calendars like the <!--del_lnk--> Abri Blanchard plaque were out of the capability of ancient people, and they could only be the result of influence by <a href="../../wp/e/Extraterrestrial_life.htm" title="Extraterrestrial life">extraterrestrial aliens</a>.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Archaeoastronomical_organisations_and_publications">Archaeoastronomical organisations and publications</span></h2>
       <p>There are currently three academic organisations for scholars of archaeoastronomy. <!--del_lnk--> ISAAC&mdash;the International Society for Archaeoastronomy and Astronomy in Culture&mdash;was founded in 1995 and now sponsors the Oxford conferences and <i>Archaeoastronomy &mdash; the Journal of Astronomy in Culture</i>. <!--del_lnk--> SEAC&mdash; La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Europ&eacute;enne pour l&rsquo;Astronomie dans la Culture&mdash;is slightly older; it was created in 1992. SEAC holds annual conferences in Europe and publishes refereed conference proceedings on an annual basis. There is also <!--del_lnk--> SIAC&mdash; La Sociedad Interamericana de Astronom&iacute;a en la Cultura, primarily a <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> organisation which was founded in 2003.</p>
       <p>Additionally the <i>Journal for the History of Astronomy</i> publishes many archaeoastronomical papers. For twenty-seven volumes (from 1979 to 2002) it published an annual supplement <i>Archaeoastronomy</i>. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage</i> (James Cook University, Australia) and <i>Culture &amp; Cosmos</i> (University of Wales, UK) also publish papers on archaeoastronomy.</p>
