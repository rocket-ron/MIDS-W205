Because archaeology's aim is to understand mankind, it is a humanistic endeavor.</p>
       <p>The goals of archaeology vary, and there is debate as to what its aims and responsibilities are. Some goals include the documentation and explanation of the origins and development of human <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">cultures</a>, understanding <!--del_lnk--> culture history, chronicling <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sociocultural_evolution.htm" title="Cultural evolution">cultural evolution</a>, and studying human <!--del_lnk--> behaviour and <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecology</a>, for both <!--del_lnk--> prehistoric and <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">historic</a> societies. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeologists">Archaeologists</a> are also concerned with the study of methods used in the discipline, and the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings underlying the questions archaeologists ask of the past. The tasks of surveying areas in order to find new sites, excavating sites in order to recover cultural remains, classification, analysis, and preservation are all important phases of the archaeological process. These are all important sources of information. Given the broad scope of the discipline there is a great deal of cross-disciplinary research in archaeology. It draws upon <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a>, <!--del_lnk--> art history, <!--del_lnk--> classics, <!--del_lnk--> ethnology, <a href="../../wp/g/Geography.htm" title="Geography">geography</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> information sciences, <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Statistics.htm" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> paleoecology, <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">paleontology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> paleozoology, <!--del_lnk--> paleoethnobotany, <!--del_lnk--> paleobotany .</p>

       <p>In parts of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Old World, the discipline has its roots in <!--del_lnk--> antiquarianism and the study of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greek.htm" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a>, and so has a natural affinity with the field of <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a>.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Archaeology in ancient China developed from antiquarian pursuits as well, specifically from the <!--del_lnk--> scholar-official's desires to revive the use of ancient relics in state ritual. This pursuit of his <!--del_lnk--> Chinese peers was criticized by <!--del_lnk--> Shen Kuo (1031&ndash;1095), who asserted that archaeology should be the pursuit of studying functionality, discovering the methods of manufacture from ancient times, and should be studied with an <!--del_lnk--> interdisciplinary approach. Yet there were others who took the discipline as seriously as Shen; the official, historian, poet, and essayist <!--del_lnk--> Ouyang Xiu (1007&ndash;1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early <!--del_lnk--> epigraphy and archaeology.</p>
       <p>The study of <!--del_lnk--> Egyptology began in medieval <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Egypt, where <!--del_lnk--> Muslim historians attempted to learn about <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptian</a> culture. The first known attempts at deciphering <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian hieroglyphs were made by <!--del_lnk--> Dhul-Nun al-Misri and <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Wahshiyya in the 9th century, who were able to at least partly understand what was written in the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, by relating them to the contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Coptic language used by <!--del_lnk--> Coptic priests in their time. <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Latif al-Baghdadi, a teacher at <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>'s <!--del_lnk--> Al-Azhar University in the 13th century, wrote detailed descriptions on <!--del_lnk--> ancient Egyptian monuments. Similarly, the 15th-century Egyptian historian <!--del_lnk--> Al-Maqrizi wrote detailed accounts of Egyptian antiquities.</p>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> archaeology is one of the four sub-fields, or <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm#branches_of_anthropology" title="Anthropology">branches of anthropology</a>.

       <p>The history of archaeology has been one of increasing professionalisation, and the use of an increasing range of techniques, to obtain as much data on the site being examined as possible.</p>
       <p>Excavations of ancient monuments and the collection of antiquities have been taking place for thousands of years, but these were mostly for the extraction of valuable or aesthetically pleasing artifacts.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Johann Joachim Winckelmann is called "the prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology,". Winckelmann was one of the founders of modern scientific archaeology by first applying empirical categories of classical (Greek and Roman) style on a large, systematic basis to the <!--del_lnk--> history of art and architecture.</p>
       <p>It was only in the 19th century that the systematic study of the past through its physical remains began to be carried out. A notable early development was the founding in Rome in 1829, by <!--del_lnk--> Eduard Gerhard and others, of the Institute for Archaeological Correspondence (Instituto di corrispondenza archeologica or Institut f&uuml;r arch&auml;ologische Korrespondenz). Archaeological methods were developed by both interested amateurs and professionals, including <!--del_lnk--> Augustus Pitt Rivers and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Flinders_Petrie.htm" title="William Flinders Petrie">William Flinders Petrie</a>.</p>
       <p>This process was continued in the 20th century by such people as <!--del_lnk--> Mortimer Wheeler, whose highly disciplined approach to excavation greatly improved the quality of evidence that could be obtained.</p>
       <p>During the 20th century, the development of <!--del_lnk--> urban archaeology and then <!--del_lnk--> rescue archaeology have been important factors, as has the development of <!--del_lnk--> archaeological science, which has greatly increased the amount of data that it is possible to obtain.</p>
       <p>Another branch, <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeoastronomy.htm" title="Archaeoastronomy">archaeoastronomy</a>, is not as well known as archaeology, but deals with the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in cultural context.</p>

       <p>Often archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. <a href="../../wp/w/Writing.htm" title="Writing">Writing</a> as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the <!--del_lnk--> 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilizations</a>. In contrast <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Homo Sapiens">Homo sapiens</a> has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of <!--del_lnk--> Homo for millions of years (see <!--del_lnk--> Human evolution). These <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilizations</a> are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization &ndash; the development of <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, cult practices of <!--del_lnk--> folk religion, the rise of the first <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">cities</a> &ndash; must come from archaeology.</p>

       <p>Even where written records do exist, they are often incomplete and invariably biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the <!--del_lnk--> elite classes, such as the <!--del_lnk--> clergy or the <!--del_lnk--> bureaucracy of court or temple. The literacy even of <!--del_lnk--> aristocrats has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into <a href="../../wp/l/Library.htm" title="Library">libraries</a> and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually only a fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record is closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own inaccuracies, such as <!--del_lnk--> sampling bias and <!--del_lnk--> differential preservation.</p>
       <p>In addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Aesthetics.htm" title="Aesthetic">aesthetic</a> appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.</p>
       <p>This view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>The Mummy</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> King Solomon's Mines</i>. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of <!--del_lnk--> pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents (see Pseudoarchaeology, below). However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Archaeological_theories">Archaeological theories</span></h2>
       <p>There is no single theory of archaeology, and even definitions are disputed. Until the mid-20th century, there was a general consensus that archaeology was closely related to both <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>.</p>
       <p>The first major phase in the history of archaeological theory in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is commonly referred to as <!--del_lnk--> cultural, or culture, history. It is best known for its emphasis on <!--del_lnk--> historical particularism.</p>
       <p>In the 1920s in the American Southwest cultural historical archaeology was intimately tied with the <!--del_lnk--> direct historical approach. This approach continues to be pursued in the American Southwest, the American Northwest Coast, Mesoamerica, the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Oceania.htm" title="Oceania">Oceania</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Siberia, and other world areas where there appears to be continuity between living, indigenous populations and archaeological remains of past groups. In pursuing the direct historical approach, <!--del_lnk--> ethnohistorical and early historical records play an important role in articulating the connections between modern people and the archaeological past. Literary sources can be used in other contexts as well, for example, in the case of <a href="../../wp/h/Hadrian%2527s_Wall.htm" title="Hadrian's Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a>.</p>
       <p>In the 1960s, a number of primarily American archaeologists, such as <!--del_lnk--> Lewis Binford and Kent Flannery, rebelled against the paradigms of cultural history. They proposed a "New Archaeology", which would be more "scientific" and "anthropological", with <!--del_lnk--> hypothesis testing and the <!--del_lnk--> scientific method very important parts of what became known as <i><!--del_lnk--> processual archaeology</i>.</p>
       <p>In the 1980s, a new <!--del_lnk--> postmodern movement arose led by the British archaeologists <!--del_lnk--> Michael Shanks, <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Tilley, <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Miller, and <!--del_lnk--> Ian Hodder. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasised the importance of a more self-critical theoretical <!--del_lnk--> reflexivity. This approach is termed <i><!--del_lnk--> post-processual archaeology</i>. However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor. The validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate.</p>
       <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Historical Processualism</i> is an emerging paradigm that seeks to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.</p>
       <p>Archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">neo-Darwinian evolutionary thought</a>, <!--del_lnk--> phenomenology, <!--del_lnk--> postmodernism, <!--del_lnk--> agency theory, <!--del_lnk--> cognitive science, <!--del_lnk--> Functionalism, <!--del_lnk--> gender-based and <!--del_lnk--> Feminist archaeology, and <!--del_lnk--> Systems theory.</p>

       <p>A modern archaeological project often begins with a <!--del_lnk--> survey. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and <!--del_lnk--> middens, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.</p>
       <p>Survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible features there. <!--del_lnk--> Gordon Willey pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the <!--del_lnk--> Viru Valley of coastal <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>, and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.</p>
       <p>Survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ <a href="../../wp/s/Sampling_%2528statistics%2529.htm" title="Sampling (statistics)">sampling</a> methods.) As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as <!--del_lnk--> settlement patterns and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into <!--del_lnk--> maps, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.</p>
       <p>The simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as <!--del_lnk--> augers, <!--del_lnk--> corers, and <!--del_lnk--> shovel test pits.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Aerial survey is conducted using <!--del_lnk--> cameras attached to <!--del_lnk--> airplanes, <!--del_lnk--> balloons, or even <a href="../../wp/k/Kite.htm" title="Kite">kites</a>. A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">Plants</a> growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as <!--del_lnk--> middens) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">grain</a>, which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs <!--del_lnk--> infrared, ground-penetrating <a href="../../wp/r/Radar.htm" title="Radar">radar</a> wavelengths, and <!--del_lnk--> thermography.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Archaeological geophysics can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. <!--del_lnk--> Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the <!--del_lnk--> Earth's magnetic field caused by <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> artifacts, <!--del_lnk--> kilns, some types of <!--del_lnk--> stone structures, and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the <!--del_lnk--> electrical resistivity of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological Features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils , while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.</p>
       <p>Although some archaeologists consider the use of <!--del_lnk--> metal detectors to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying. Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on <a href="../../wp/e/English_Civil_War.htm" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a nineteenth century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to the <!--del_lnk--> archaeological record where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the <!--del_lnk--> Portable Antiquities Scheme.</p>
       <p>Regional survey in <!--del_lnk--> underwater archaeology uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, <!--del_lnk--> side-scan sonar, or sub-bottom sonar.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Archaeological excavation existed even when the field was still the domain of amateurs, and it remains the source of the majority of data recovered in most field projects. It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as <!--del_lnk--> stratigraphy, three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.</p>
       <p>Modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their <!--del_lnk--> provenance or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see <!--del_lnk--> Primary Laws of Archaeology). Similarly, their <!--del_lnk--> association, or <!--del_lnk--> relationship with nearby objects and <!--del_lnk--> features, needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce what <!--del_lnk--> artifacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different <!--del_lnk--> phases of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its <!--del_lnk--> stratigraphy; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">cultures</a>, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.</p>
       <p>Excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research,in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethical</a> concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and "method statement" issued. In places 90% excavation is common. <a href="../../wp/s/Sampling_%2528statistics%2529.htm" title="Sampling (statistics)">Sampling</a> is even more important in excavation than in survey. It is common for large mechanical equipment, such as <!--del_lnk--> backhoes (<!--del_lnk--> JCBs), to be used in excavation, especially to remove the <!--del_lnk--> topsoil (<!--del_lnk--> overburden), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with <!--del_lnk--> trowels or <!--del_lnk--> hoes to ensure that all features are apparent.</p>
       <p>The next task is to form a <!--del_lnk--> site plan and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the <!--del_lnk--> natural subsoil are normally excavated in portions in order to produce a visible <!--del_lnk--> archaeological section for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the <!--del_lnk--> cut and the <!--del_lnk--> fill. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is, understandably, what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and <!--del_lnk--> sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and <!--del_lnk--> recording sheets are filled in describing the <!--del_lnk--> context of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis">Analysis</span></h3>
       <p>Once artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them, to gain as much data as possible. This process is known as post-excavation analysis, and is normally the most time-consuming part of the archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for the final excavation reports on major sites to take years to be published.</p>
       <p>At its most basic, the artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections, in order to classify them <!--del_lnk--> typologically and to identify other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through <!--del_lnk--> archaeological science, meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. The bones, plants and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed (using the techniques of <!--del_lnk--> zooarchaeology, <!--del_lnk--> paleoethnobotany, and <!--del_lnk--> palynology), while any texts can usually be <!--del_lnk--> deciphered.</p>
       <p>These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known and therefore contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Academic_sub-disciplines">Academic sub-disciplines</span></h2>
       <p>As with most <!--del_lnk--> academic disciplines, there are a very large number of <!--del_lnk--> archaeological sub-disciplines characterised by a specific method or type of material (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> lithic analysis, <!--del_lnk--> music, <!--del_lnk--> archaeobotany), geographical or chronological focus (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Near Eastern archaeology, <!--del_lnk--> Medieval archaeology), other thematic concern (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> maritime archaeology, <!--del_lnk--> landscape archaeology, <!--del_lnk--> battlefield archaeology), or a specific <!--del_lnk--> archaeological culture or <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilisation">civilisation</a> (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Egyptology, <!--del_lnk--> Indology, <!--del_lnk--> Sinology).</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_archaeology">Historical archaeology</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Historical archaeology is the study of cultures with some form of writing.</p>
       <p>In <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, archaeologists have uncovered the long-lost layouts of medieval villages abandoned after the crises of the 14th century and the equally lost layouts of 17th century parterre gardens swept away by a change in fashion. In downtown <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the African burial ground.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ethnoarchaeology">Ethnoarchaeology</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Ethnoarchaeology is the archaeological study of living people. The approach gained notoriety during the emphasis on middle range theory that was a feature of the processual movement of the 1960s. Early ethnoarchaeological research focused on hunting and gathering or foraging societies. Ethnoarchaeology continues to be a vibrant component of post-processual and other current archaeological approaches.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Experimental_archaeology">Experimental archaeology</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Experimental archaeology represents the application of the experimental method to develop more highly controlled observations of processes that create and impact the archaeological record. In the context of the context of the logical positivism of processualism with its goals of improving the scientific rigor of archaeological <!--del_lnk--> epistemologies the experimental method gained importance. Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Archaeometry">Archaeometry</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Archaeometry is a field of study that aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a lively field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.</p>

       <p>Early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Such pursuits continue to fascinate the public. Books, films, and video games, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> King Solomon's Mines</i>, <i><a href="../../wp/i/Indiana_Jones.htm" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a></i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Tomb Raider</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>The Mummy</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Relic Hunter</i> all testify to the public's interest in the discovery aspect of archaeology.</p>
       <p>Much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as <!--del_lnk--> Cop&aacute;n and the <!--del_lnk--> Valley of the Kings, but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern <!--del_lnk--> survey, <!--del_lnk--> excavation, and <!--del_lnk--> data processing. Some archaeologists refer to such portrayals as "<!--del_lnk--> pseudoarchaeology".</p>
       <p>Archaeology has been portrayed in the mainstream media in sensational ways. This has its advantages and disadvantages. Many practitioners point to the childhood excitement of <a href="../../wp/i/Indiana_Jones.htm" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> films and <!--del_lnk--> Tomb Raider video games as the inspiration for them to enter the field. Archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support, the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed. Without a strong public interest in the subject, often sparked by significant finds and celebrity archaeologists, it would be a great deal harder for archaeologists to gain the political and financial support they require.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_Archaeology">Public Archaeology</span></h2>
       <p>Motivated by a desire to halt <b>looting</b>, curb <b>pseudoarchaeology</b>, and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting <b>public-outreach campaigns</b>. They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists. Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.</p>
       <p>One audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.</p>
       <p>In the UK, popular archaeology programs such as <!--del_lnk--> Time Team and <!--del_lnk--> Meet the Ancestors have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest. Where possible, archaeologists now make more provisions for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did, and many local archaeological organizations operate within the <!--del_lnk--> Community archaeology framework to expand public involvement in smaller-scale, more local projects. Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary <!--del_lnk--> health and safety and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern <!--del_lnk--> building site with tight deadlines. Certain charities and <!--del_lnk--> local government bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project. There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial <!--del_lnk--> training excavations and archaeological holiday tours.</p>
       <p>Archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why <!--del_lnk--> Community archaeology projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do. Anyone looking to participate in archaeological opportunities should contact one of these local societies or organizations.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pseudoarchaeology">Pseudoarchaeology</span></h2>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Pseudoarchaeology is an umbrella term for all activities that claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of <!--del_lnk--> processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in <!--del_lnk--> post-processualism.</p>
       <p>An example of this type is the writing of <!--del_lnk--> Erich von D&auml;niken. His <!--del_lnk--> Chariots of the Gods (1968), together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilisation on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilisations. This theory, known as <!--del_lnk--> palaeocontact theory, or <!--del_lnk--> Ancient astronaut theory, is not exclusively D&auml;niken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Xenoarchaeology is the hypothetical future examination of the archaeology of extraterrestrials. It is theoretical and based in <!--del_lnk--> science fiction work, and is not a recognised sub-discipline of archaeology.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Cryptoarchaeology claims to be a valid form of archaeology, in that it may follow commonly accepted best practices and the <!--del_lnk--> scientific method of <!--del_lnk--> processual archaeology, though it focuses on anomalous discoveries and other such remains that do not adhere to orthodox theory and thought.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Looting of archaeological sites by people in search of <!--del_lnk--> hoards of buried treasure is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian <!--del_lnk--> pharaohs were looted in antiquity.</p>
       <p>Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, but it can also attract unwelcome attention by looters to these places. The commercial demand for artifacts encourages looting and the <!--del_lnk--> illicit antiquities trade, which smuggles items abroad to private collectors. Looters damage or destroy archaeological sites, deny archaeologists valuable information that would be recovered from excavation, and ultimately rob people of the opportunity to know their past.</p>
       <p>Popular consciousness often associates looting with poor <!--del_lnk--> Third World countries, but this is a false assumption. A lack of financial resources and political will are chronic worldwide problems inhibiting more effective protection of archaeological sites.</p>
       <p>In 1937 W. F. Hodge the Director of the <!--del_lnk--> Southwest Museum in <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles.htm" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> CA, released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts. The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the <!--del_lnk--> Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721; 16 U.S.C. 470aamm) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Descendant_peoples">Descendant peoples</span></h2>
       <p>In the United States, examples such as the case of <!--del_lnk--> Kennewick Man have illustrated the tensions between <a href="../../wp/n/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States.htm" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans</a> and archaeologists which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful towards burials sacred sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.</p>
       <p>As a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the <!--del_lnk--> Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of postprocessualism, some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples likely to be descended from those under study.</p>
       <p>Archaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites in order to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.</p>
       <p>While this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Repatriation">Repatriation</span></h4>
       <p>A new trend in the heated controversy between <!--del_lnk--> First Nations groups and scientists is the <!--del_lnk--> repatriation of native <!--del_lnk--> artifacts to the original descendants. An example of this occurred <!--del_lnk--> June 21, <a href="../../wp/2/2005.htm" title="2005">2005</a>, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 <!--del_lnk--> Algonquian nations in the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottawa.htm" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near <!--del_lnk--> Maniwaki, Quebec, to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods &mdash; some dating back 6,000 years.</p>
       <p>The ceremony marked the end of a journey spanning thousands of years and many miles. The remains and artifacts, including <!--del_lnk--> beads, <!--del_lnk--> tools and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Weapon.htm" title="Weapons">weapons</a>, were originally excavated from various sites in the <!--del_lnk--> Ottawa Valley, including <!--del_lnk--> Morrison and the <!--del_lnk--> Allumette Islands. They had been part of the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Museum of Civilization&rsquo;s research collection for decades, some since the late 1800s. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional <!--del_lnk--> redcedar and <!--del_lnk--> birchbark boxes lined with redcedar chips, <!--del_lnk--> muskrat and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/b/Beaver.htm" title="Beaver pelt">beaver pelts</a>.</p>
       <p>Now, an inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 90 boxes of various sizes are buried. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Kennewick Man is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.</p>
