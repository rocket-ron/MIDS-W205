       <p><i><b>Ant &amp; Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway</b></i> is a variety show shown in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> on Saturday evenings on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/ITV_%2528TV_network%2529.htm" title="ITV">ITV</a> (and repeated on Sunday mornings on <!--del_lnk--> ITV2), presented and executively produced by <!--del_lnk--> Ant &amp; Dec.</p>
       <p>Each show ends with the main event in which a contestant from the audience attempts to win 20 items advertised during a randomly-chosen programme from the preceding week.</p>
       <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 10 September <a href="../../wp/2/2005.htm" title="2005">2005</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/ITV_%2528TV_network%2529.htm" title="ITV">ITV</a> had a programme listing the best 50 shows in ITV's 50 years being on air. <i>Ant &amp; Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway</i> came 2nd, being beaten by <i><a href="../../wp/c/Coronation_Street.htm" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a></i>. Launched in 2002, the series was unbeaten in its timeslot for three years until scheduled against <i><a href="../../wp/d/Doctor_Who.htm" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> on <!--del_lnk--> BBC One in March 2005.</p>

       </ul>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_beginning_games">The beginning games</span></h3>
       <p>All series. After a funny scene and what's coming up on the show Ant goes to the right hand side of the audience and picks one person at a time to comment on (usually something embarrassing) and would start up a game. Recent games include: Court in the Act, Where's your Shed at?, STOP! That's Mine, Stars in their Lives, Shame That Tune and This Is Your Diary.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Win_The_Ads">Win The Ads</span></h3>
       <p>All series. The climax of the show, inviting a lucky member of the audience to "Don't just watch the adverts, win 'em". An ITV show is selected at random and 20 prizes are taken from the adverts shown within it. The contestant has 60 seconds (90 in the first series, recently sometimes 45 if the show was running short on time) to answer as many questions correctly.</p>
       <p>After that, they have to decide to take the prizes and run or gamble it all on one final question. Get it right, and they win the lot. Get it wrong though and they lose everything and leave with just a roll of toilet paper.</p>
       <p>In series 1, three contestants were chosen and whittled down to one in a short quiz. This was discontinued from series 2 and one was just selected at random.</p>
       <p>In series 5, a new feature was added, which was to show them one of the prizes they picked to help the contestants whether to gamble or not.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Grab_The_Ads">Grab The Ads</span></h3>
       <p>All series. A similar advert contest for viewers at home. This has followed two formats.</p>
       <p>Format 1 was calling one member of the public and asking them to pick a number between 1 to 9. Whatever prize is behind that number is theirs. This was only used in Series 1.</p>
       <p>The current format, used since series 2, has seen a different celebrity each week playing a different game which is used to generate a number between 1 to 9 and the prize behind it goes to the viewer chosen before that turn.</p>
       <p><b>Games include:</b></p>
       <ul>
        <li>Human Roulette</li>
        <li>Human Bingo</li>
        <li>Box-to-Box</li>
        <li>Human Archery</li>
        <li>Cupid</li>

       </ul>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ant_v_Dec">Ant v Dec</span></h3>
       <p>Introduced in Series 5. The duo are given a certain task and they are given a week to learn a certain task and perform it live the next week. <!--del_lnk--> Kirsty Gallagher presents for this part of the show while <!--del_lnk--> David Goldstrom commentates on proceedings on certain weeks.</p>

        <li>The best remembered challenge is the motorbike stunt jump, which was called off after Dec had a bad accident during his jump, which resulted in a broken right thumb and his left arm in a sling for a few weeks afterwards, which became a source of much mirth on the show in subsequent weeks. Indeed, Ant's puppet of Dec in the ventriloquism challenge came with its own sling.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>The winner of the challenge earned 1 point on the scoreboard (except for the week the accident occurred, where both Ant &amp; Dec got a point since it was called off that week). In the end, Dec triumphed over Ant 6-5, winning the last challenge, the penalty shoot-out competition, to become overall winner. As a <!--del_lnk--> forfeit, Ant had to perform a bush tucker trial from <i><!--del_lnk--> I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!</i>, and sing a specially written 'loser's song', <i>"I Am A Loser"</i>, to the tune of <i>"<!--del_lnk--> We Are the Champions"</i>.</li>

Such victims include <!--del_lnk--> Kevin Costner and <!--del_lnk--> Sarah Michelle Gellar. They had even interviewed Ant and Dec.
