He was the first known European explorer to reach the islands of <!--del_lnk--> Van Diemen's Land (now <!--del_lnk--> Tasmania) and <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and to sight the <a href="../../wp/f/Fiji.htm" title="Fiji">Fiji</a> islands.

       <p>Abel Tasman was born in 1603 in <!--del_lnk--> Lutjegast in what is now the <!--del_lnk--> province of Groningen, the Netherlands. In 1633, Tasman went to <a href="../../wp/j/Jakarta.htm" title="Jakarta">Batavia</a> in service of the <!--del_lnk--> VOC; four years later he was back in Amsterdam. Tasman signed on for another ten years and took his wife along to Batavia. In 1639 Tasman was sent as second in command of an exploring expedition in the north Pacific under <!--del_lnk--> Matthijs Quast. His fleet included the ships <i>Engel</i> and <i>Gracht</i> and reached <!--del_lnk--> Fort Zeelandia (<!--del_lnk--> Dutch Formosa) and <!--del_lnk--> Deshima.</p>

       <p>In August 1642, the Council of the Indies, consisting of <!--del_lnk--> Antonie van Diemen, <!--del_lnk--> Cornelis van der Lijn, <!--del_lnk--> Joan Maetsuycker, <!--del_lnk--> Justus Schouten, <!--del_lnk--> Salomon Sweers, Cornelis Witsen, and Pieter Boreel in Batavia despatched Abel Tasman and Franchoijs Visscher on a voyage of which one of the objects was to obtain knowledge of "all the totally unknown provinces of Beach".</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Beach_and_Terra_Australis">Beach and Terra Australis</span></h3>
       <p><i>Beach</i> appeared on maps of the time, notably that of <!--del_lnk--> Abraham Ortelius of 1570 and that of <!--del_lnk--> Jan Huygen van Linschoten of 1596, as the northernmost part of the southern continent, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Terra Australis</i>, along with <i>Locach</i>. According to <a href="../../wp/m/Marco_Polo.htm" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a>, <i>Locach</i> was a kingdom where gold was &ldquo;so plentiful that no none who did not see it could believe it&rdquo;. <i>Beach</i> was in fact a mistranscription of <i>Locach</i>. Locach was Marco Polo&rsquo;s name for the southern Thai kingdom of Lavo, or <!--del_lnk--> Lop Buri, the &ldquo;city of Lavo&rdquo;, (&#xE25;&#xE1E;&#xE1A;&#xE23;, after Lavo, the son of <a href="../../wp/r/Rama.htm" title="Rama">Rama</a> in <a href="../../wp/h/Hindu_mythology.htm" title="Hindu mythology">Hindu mythology</a>). In Chinese (<!--del_lnk--> Cantonese), Lavo was pronounced &ldquo;Lo-huk&rdquo; (&#x7F85;&#x659B;), from which Marco Polo took his rendition of the name. In the <!--del_lnk--> German cursive script, &ldquo;Locach&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beach&rdquo; look similar, and in the 1532 edition of <!--del_lnk--> Marco Polo&rsquo;s <i>Travels</i> his Locach was changed to <i>Bo&euml;ach</i>, later shortened to <i>Beach</i>. They seem to have drawn on the map of the world published in Florence in 1489 by <!--del_lnk--> Henricus Martellus, in which <i>provincia bo&euml;ach</i> appears as the southern neighbour of <i>provincia ciamba</i>. Book III of Marco Polo&rsquo;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Il Milione</i> described his journey by sea from China to India by way of <!--del_lnk--> Champa (= Southern Vietnam), Java (which he called <i><!--del_lnk--> Java Major</i>), Locach and Sumatra (called <i>Java Minor</i>). After a chapter describing the kingdom of Champa there follows a chapter describing <!--del_lnk--> Java (which he did not visit himself). The narrative then resumes, describing the route southward from Champa toward <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, but by a slip of the pen the name &ldquo;Java&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;Champa&rdquo; as the point of departure, locating Sumatra 1,300 miles to the south of Java instead of Champa. Locach, located between Champa and Sumatra, was likewise misplaced far to the south of Java, by some geographers on or near an extension of the <i>Terra Australis</i>. As explained by Sir <!--del_lnk--> Henry Yule, the editor of an English edition of Marco Polo&rsquo;s <i>Travels</i>: &ldquo;Some geographers of the 16th century, following the old editions which carried the travellers south-east of Java to the land of &ldquo;Boeach&rdquo; (or Locac), introduced in their maps a continent in that situation&rdquo;. <!--del_lnk--> Gerard Mercator did just that on his 1541 globe, placing <i>Beach provincia aurifera</i> (&ldquo;Beach the gold-bearing province&rdquo;) in the northernmost part of the <i>Terra Australis</i> in accordance with the faulty text of Marco Polo&rsquo;s <i>Travels</i>. It remained in this location on his world map of 1569, with the amplified description, quoting Marco Polo, <i>Beach provincia aurifera quam pauci ex alienis regionibus adeunt propter gentis inhumanitatem</i> (&ldquo;Beach the gold-bearing province, wither few go from other countries because of the inhumanity of its people&rdquo;) with <i>Lucach regnum</i> shown somewhat to its south west. Following Mercator, <!--del_lnk--> Abraham Ortelius also showed <i>BEACH</i> and <i>LVCACH</i> in these locations on his world map of 1571. Likewise, Linschoten&rsquo;s very popular 1596 map of the East Indies showed <i>BEACH</i> projecting from the map&rsquo;s southern edge, leading (or misleading) Visscher and Tasman in their voyage of 1642 to seek Beach with its plentiful gold in a location to the south of the <a href="../../wp/s/Solomon_Islands.htm" title="Solomon Islands">Solomon Islands</a> somewhere between <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="Staten Land">Staten Land</a> near <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Horn.htm" title="Cape Horn">Cape Horn</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Cape of Good Hope. Confirmation that land existed where the maps showed <i>Beach</i> to be had come from <!--del_lnk--> Dirk Hartog&rsquo;s landing in October 1616 on its west coast, which he called <!--del_lnk--> Eendrachtsland after the name of his ship. Abel Tasman endured a very rough journey from Tasmania to New Zealand. In one of his diary entries Tasman credits his compass, claiming it was the only thing that kept him alive.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mauritius">Mauritius</span></h3>
       <p>In accordance with Visscher's directions, Tasman sailed first to <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritius.htm" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> and arrived on 5 September 1642. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor <!--del_lnk--> Adriaan van der Stel. Because of the prevailing winds Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four week stay on the island both ships left on 8 October. After one month it started to snow and hail; Tasman changed course more north. Part of the western shore of the continent was already known to the Dutch, but no one had gone as far as <!--del_lnk--> Pieter Nuyts.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tasmania">Tasmania</span></h3>
       <p>On 24 November 1642 Abel Tasman sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour. He named his discovery Van Diemen's Land after <!--del_lnk--> Antonio van Diemen, <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Proceeding south he skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east, Tasman then tried to work his two ships into <!--del_lnk--> Adventure Bay on the east coast of <!--del_lnk--> South Bruny Island where he was blown out to sea by a storm, this area he named <!--del_lnk--> Storm Bay. Two days later Tasman anchored to the North of Cape Frederick Hendrick just North of the <!--del_lnk--> Forestier Peninsula. Tasman then landed in Blackman Bay &ndash; in the larger <!--del_lnk--> Marion Bay. The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay; however, because the sea was too rough the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag in North Bay. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="New_Zealand">New Zealand</span></h3>
       <p>After some exploration, Tasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. On 13 December they sighted land on the north-west coast of the <!--del_lnk--> South Island, New Zealand, becoming the first Europeans to do so. Tasman named it <i>Staten Landt</i> on the assumption that it was connected to an island (<!--del_lnk--> Staten Island, Argentina) at the south of the tip of South America. Proceeding north and then east, he stopped to gather water, but one of his boats was attacked by <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori in <!--del_lnk--> waka (canoes) and four of his men and several M&#x101;ori were killed. Archeological research has shown the Dutch had tried to land at a major agricultural area, which the M&#x101;ori may have been trying to protect. Tasman named the bay <i>Murderers' Bay</i> (now known as <!--del_lnk--> Golden Bay) and sailed north, but mistook <!--del_lnk--> Cook Strait for a <!--del_lnk--> bight (naming it <i><!--del_lnk--> Zeehaen's Bight</i>). Two names he gave to New Zealand landmarks still endure, <!--del_lnk--> Cape Maria van Diemen and <!--del_lnk--> Three Kings Islands, but <i>Kaap Pieter Boreels</i> was renamed by Cook 125 years later to <!--del_lnk--> Cape Egmont.</p>
       <h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_return_voyage">The return voyage</span></h3>
       <p>On route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the <a href="../../wp/t/Tonga.htm" title="Tonga">Tongan</a> archipelago on 20 January 1643. While passing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fiji.htm" title="Fiji Islands">Fiji Islands</a> Tasman's ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of <!--del_lnk--> Vanua Levu and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fiji.htm" title="Cikobia">Cikobia</a> before making his way back into the open sea. He eventually turned north-west to <!--del_lnk--> New Guinea, and arrived at Batavia on 15 June 1643.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Second_Pacific_voyage">Second Pacific voyage</span></h2>
       <p>With three ships on his second voyage (<i>Limmen</i>, <i>Zeemeeuw</i> and the tender <i>Braek</i>) in 1644, he followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards. He missed the <!--del_lnk--> Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia, and continued his voyage along the Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia making observations on the land, called <!--del_lnk--> New Holland, and its people.</p>
       <p>From the point of view of the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch East India Company Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although received modestly, the company was upset to a degree that Tasman didn't fully explore the lands he found, and decided that a more "persistent explorer" should be chosen for any future expeditions. For over a century, until the era of <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a>, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans &ndash; mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.</p>
       <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Later_life">Later life</span></h2>
       <p>On 2 November 1644 Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice at Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648 he was in charge of an expedition sent to <a href="../../wp/m/Manila.htm" title="Manila">Manila</a> to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649 he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651 he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia in October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. The poor in <!--del_lnk--> Lutjegast received the small amount of only 25 guilders.</p>
