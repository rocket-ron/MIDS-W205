       <p>The <b>Age of Discovery</b> or <b>Age of Exploration</b> was a period from the early <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a> and continuing into the early <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a>, during which <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> ships traveled around the world, often in search of new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> and <!--del_lnk--> spices. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. Among the most famous <!--del_lnk--> explorers of the period were <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vasco_da_Gama.htm" title="Vasco da Gama">Vasco da Gama</a>, and <a href="../../wp/f/Ferdinand_Magellan.htm" title="Ferdinand Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a>.</p>
       <p>The age of exploration was rooted in new technologies and ideas growing out of the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. These included advances in <!--del_lnk--> cartography, <!--del_lnk--> navigation, firepower and shipbuilding. Many people wanted to find a route to Asia through the west of Europe. The most important development was the invention of first the <!--del_lnk--> carrack and then <!--del_lnk--> caravel in <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>. These vessels evolved from <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Medieval">medieval</a> European designs with a fruitful combination of Mediterranean and North Sea designs and the addition of some Arabic elements. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> and sail safely on the open <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The prelude to the Age of Exploration was a series of European expeditions crossing <!--del_lnk--> Eurasia by land in the late <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. While the <!--del_lnk--> Mongols had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction they also unified much of Eurasia creating trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China (although land routes from <!--del_lnk--> Han Dynasty China to the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> existed beforehand, see <a href="../../wp/s/Silk_Road.htm" title="Silk Road">Silk Road</a>). A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. These were almost all Italians as the trade between Europe and the Middle East was almost completely controlled by traders from the Italian city states. Their close links to the <!--del_lnk--> Levant created great curiosity and commercial interest in what lay further east. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Papacy">Papacy</a> also launched expeditions in hopes of finding converts, or the fabled <!--del_lnk--> Prester John.</p>
       <p>The first of these travelers was <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni de Plano Carpini who journeyed to <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> and back from 1241&ndash;1247. The most famous traveler, however, was <a href="../../wp/m/Marco_Polo.htm" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a> who wrote of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295 in which he described being a guest at the <a href="../../wp/y/Yuan_Dynasty.htm" title="Yuan Dynasty">Yuan Dynasty</a> court of <a href="../../wp/k/Kublai_Khan.htm" title="Kublai Khan">Kublai Khan</a>. His journey was written up as <i><!--del_lnk--> Travels</i> and the work was read throughout Europe. In 1439, <!--del_lnk--> Niccol&ograve; Da Conti published an account of his travels to India and Southeast Asia. In 1466-1472, a Russian merchant <!--del_lnk--> Afanasy Nikitin of <!--del_lnk--> Tver described travels to <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> in his book <i><!--del_lnk--> A Journey Beyond the Three Seas</i>.</p>
       <p>These journeys had little immediate effect, however; the Mongol Empire collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became far more difficult and dangerous. The <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> of the fourteenth century also blocked travel and trade. The land route to the East was always to be too long and difficult for profitable trade and it was also controlled by Islamic empires that had long battled the Europeans. The rise of the aggressive and expansionist <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> further limited the possibilities for the Europeans.</p>

       <p>It was not until the <!--del_lnk--> carrack and then the <!--del_lnk--> caravel were developed in <!--del_lnk--> Iberia that European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. <!--del_lnk--> Monetarists believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of <!--del_lnk--> bullion in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south. The <a href="../../wp/s/Silk_Road.htm" title="Silk Road">eastern trade routes</a> were controlled by the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> after the <!--del_lnk--> Turks took control of <a href="../../wp/c/Constantinople.htm" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1453, and they barred Europeans from those trade routes. The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to their survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbours. The carrack and caravel both incorporated the Arab <!--del_lnk--> lateen sail that made ships far more maneuverable. It was also through the Arabs that <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Greek geography was rediscovered, for the first time giving European sailors some idea of the shape of Africa and Asia.</p>

       <p>The first great wave of expeditions was launched by <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> under Prince <!--del_lnk--> Henry the Navigator. Sailing out into the open Atlantic the <!--del_lnk--> Madeira Islands were discovered in 1419, and in 1427 the <!--del_lnk--> Azores, both becoming Portuguese colonies. The main project of Henry the Navigator was exploration of the West Coast of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. For centuries the only trade routes linking <a href="../../wp/w/West_Africa.htm" title="West Africa">West Africa</a> with the Mediterranean world were over the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Sahara.htm" title="Sahara Desert">Sahara Desert</a>. These routes bringing <!--del_lnk--> slaves and gold were controlled by the Muslim states of North Africa, long rivals to Portugal and Spain. It was the Portuguese hope that the Islamic nations could be bypassed by trading directly with West Africa by sea. It was also hoped that south of the Sahara the states would be <!--del_lnk--> Christian and potential allies against the Muslims in the <a href="../../wp/m/Maghreb.htm" title="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>. The Portuguese navigators made slow but steady progress, each year managing to push a few miles further south, and in 1434 the obstacle of <!--del_lnk--> Cape Bojador was overcome. In the <!--del_lnk--> bull <!--del_lnk--> Romanus Pontifex the trade monopoly for newly discovered countries beyond Cape Bojador was granted to the Portuguese.</p>
       <p>Within two decades, the barrier of the Sahara had been overcome and trade in slaves and gold began in what is today <a href="../../wp/s/Senegal.htm" title="Senegal">Senegal</a>. Progress continued as trading forts were built at <!--del_lnk--> Elmina and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/S%25C3%25A3o_Tom%25C3%25A9_and_Pr%25C3%25ADncipe.htm" title="S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe">S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe</a> became the first <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a> producing colony. In 1482 an expedition under <!--del_lnk--> Diogo C&atilde;o made contact with the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Kongo. The crucial breakthrough was in 1487 when <!--del_lnk--> Bartolomeu Dias rounded (and later named) the <!--del_lnk--> Cape of Good Hope and proved that access to the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> was possible. In 1498 <a href="../../wp/v/Vasco_da_Gama.htm" title="Vasco da Gama">Vasco da Gama</a> made good on this promise by reaching India.</p>

       <p>Portugal's rival <!--del_lnk--> Castile had been somewhat slower than its neighbour to begin exploring the Atlantic, and it was not until late in the fifteenth century that Castilian sailors began to compete with their Iberian neighbours. The first contest was for control of the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands, which Castile won. It was not until the union of <!--del_lnk--> Aragon and Castile and the completion of the <i><!--del_lnk--> reconquista</i> that the large nation became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492 the joint rulers of the nation conquered the Moorish <!--del_lnk--> kingdom of Granada, that had been providing Castile with African goods through <!--del_lnk--> its tribute, and they decided to fund <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>' expedition that they hoped would bypass Portugal's lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean reaching Asia by travelling west.</p>
       <p>Columbus did not reach Asia, but rather found a <!--del_lnk--> New World, <!--del_lnk--> America. In 1500, the Portuguese navigator, <!--del_lnk--> Pedro &Aacute;lvares Cabral also discovered the land that is today called <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. The issue of defining areas of influence became critical, being resolved by Papal intervention in 1494 when the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Tordesillas divided the world between the two powers. The Portuguese "received" everything outside of Europe east of a line that ran 270 <!--del_lnk--> leagues west of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Verde.htm" title="Cape Verde">Cape Verde</a> islands; this gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish received everything west of this line, territory that was still almost completely unknown, and proved to be mostly the western part of the American continent plus the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> islands.</p>
       <p>Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries - unlike Africa or Asia the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Spanish ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought in the form of abundant gold. In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of Spanish <!--del_lnk--> conquistadors, with large armies of allied natives, managed to conquer them. The most notable amongst the conquered nations were the <!--del_lnk--> Aztec empire in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> (conquered in 1521) and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca empire">Inca empire</a> in modern <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> (conquered in 1532). During this time, <!--del_lnk--> pandemics of European disease such as Smallpox devastated the indigenous populations, helping greatly in the conquest. Once Spanish sovereignty was established, the main focus would eventually become the extraction and export of gold and especially silver, though other goods were also traded.</p>
       <p>In 1519, the same year that Cortez's army landed in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> the Spanish crown funded the expedition of <a href="../../wp/f/Ferdinand_Magellan.htm" title="Ferdinand Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a>, a Portuguese (it was not an uncommon practice in those pre-nationalistic times for the various seafaring countries to employ experienced navigators from other countries - usually Portuguese or Italians). The goal of the mission was similar to Columbus' goal: to find the <!--del_lnk--> Spice Islands by traveling west, thus placing them in the Spanish sphere. The expedition managed to cross the Pacific Ocean and reach the Spice Islands, and was the first to <!--del_lnk--> circumnavigate the world upon its return three years later, though Magellan died in the Pacific, leaving the Spaniard <!--del_lnk--> Juan Sebasti&aacute;n Elcano the task of completing the voyage. The expedition was a failure in the sense that its route was impractical. The Strait of Magellan was too far south and the Pacific Ocean too vast. It was not a realistic alternative to the Portuguese route around Africa. The Spanish were able to establish a presence in the Pacific, but not based on Magellan's voyage. Rather, a cross-Pacific route was established, by other explorers, between Mexico and the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>. The eastbound route to the Philippines first sailed by Alvaro de Saavedra in 1527. The westbound return route was harder to find, but was eventually discovered by <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute;s de Urdaneta in 1565. For a long time these routes were used by the <!--del_lnk--> Manila galleons, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic routes.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Decline_of_the_Portuguese_monopoly">Decline of the Portuguese monopoly</span></h2>
       <p>Portuguese exploration and colonization continued despite the new rivalry with Spain. The Portuguese became the first Westerners to reach and trade with <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>. Under the King <!--del_lnk--> Manuel I the Portuguese crown launched a scheme to keep control of the lands and trade routes that had been declared theirs. The strategy was to build a series of forts that would allow them to control all the major trade routes of the east. Thus forts and colonies were established on the <!--del_lnk--> Gold Coast, <!--del_lnk--> Luanda, <a href="../../wp/m/Mozambique.htm" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Zanzibar, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mombasa.htm" title="Mombassa">Mombassa</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Socotra.htm" title="Socotra">Socotra</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ormuz, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/k/Kolkata.htm" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Goa.htm" title="Goa">Goa</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mumbai.htm" title="Bombay">Bombay</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Malacca, <a href="../../wp/m/Macau.htm" title="Macau">Macau</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Timor. The Portuguese also controlled <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, which had been discovered in 1500 by <!--del_lnk--> Pedro &Aacute;lvares Cabral and was partly on the Portuguese side of the global "divide" set at <!--del_lnk--> Tordesillas.</p>
       <p>Portugal had difficulty expanding its empire inland and concentrated mostly on the coastal areas. Over time the nation proved to simply be too small to provide the funds and manpower sufficient to manage and defend such a massive and dispersed venture. The forts spread across the world were chronically undermanned and ill-equipped. They could not compete with the larger powers that slowly encroached on its empire and trade. The days of near monopoly of east trade were numbered. In <!--del_lnk--> 1580 the Spanish King Philip II became also King of Portugal, as rightful heir to the Crown after his cousin Sebasti&atilde;o died without sons (Philip II of Spain was grandson of Manuel I of Portugal). The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged. The Dutch, French and English explorers ignored the <!--del_lnk--> Papal division of the world. The principle of a free seafaring trade was justified in the concept of <i>Mare Liberum</i> by the Dutch <!--del_lnk--> jurist <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Grotius. During the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a> as the Dutch, English and French established ever more trading posts in the east, at the expense of Portugal, the wealth gained added to their military might while Portugal's weakened as it lost trading posts and colonies in West Africa, the Middle East and the Far East. <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mumbai.htm" title="Bombay">Bombay</a> was given away to the English as a marriage gift. Some, like Macau, <a href="../../wp/e/East_Timor.htm" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>, Goa, <a href="../../wp/a/Angola.htm" title="Angola">Angola</a>, and Mozambique, as well as Brazil, remained in Portuguese possession. The Dutch attempted to conquer Brazil, and at one time controlled almost half of the occupied territory, but were eventually defeated.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Northern_European_involvement">Northern European involvement</span></h2>
       <p>The nations outside of Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="../../wp/k/Kingdom_of_England.htm" title="Kingdom of England">England</a> each had a long maritime tradition and, despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.</p>
       <p>The first of these missions (1497) was that of the English expedition led by the Italian, <a href="../../wp/j/John_Cabot.htm" title="John Cabot">John Cabot</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/j/John_Cabot.htm" title="Giovanni Caboto">Giovanni Caboto</a>). It was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas as its resources were fully stretched by its efforts in Central and South America where more resources had been found. In 1525, <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni da Verrazzano became the first recorded European to visit the East Coast of the present-day <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. The expeditions of Cabot, <a href="../../wp/j/Jacques_Cartier.htm" title="Jacques Cartier">Jacques Cartier</a> (first voyage 1534) and others were mainly hoping to find the <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Passage and thus a link to the riches of Asia. This was never discovered, but in their travels other possibilities were found and in the early seventeenth century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America.</p>
       <p>It was the northerners who also became the great rivals to the Portuguese in Africa and around the Indian Ocean. Dutch, French, and English ships began to flout the Portuguese monopoly and found trading forts and colonies of their own. Gradually the Portuguese and Spanish market and possession share declined, the new entrants surrounding many of their most valuable possessions (like Hong Kong being next to Macau). The northern Europeans also took the lead in exploring the last unknown regions of the Pacific Ocean and the North-American west coast, which was in the Spanish part of the <!--del_lnk--> Tordesillas divide. Dutch explorers such as <!--del_lnk--> Willem Jansz and <a href="../../wp/a/Abel_Tasman.htm" title="Abel Tasman">Abel Tasman</a> explored the coasts of <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> while in the eighteenth century it was English explorer <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> who mapped much of <!--del_lnk--> Polynesia.</p>
