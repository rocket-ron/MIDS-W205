       <p>The <b>axe</b>, or <b>ax</b>, is an implement that has been used for <!--del_lnk--> millennia to shape, split and cut <a href="../../wp/w/Wood.htm" title="Wood">wood</a>; to <a href="../../wp/h/Harvest.htm" title="Harvest">harvest</a> <!--del_lnk--> timber; as a <a href="../../wp/w/Weapon.htm" title="Weapon">weapon</a>; and as a <!--del_lnk--> ceremonial or <a href="../../wp/h/Heraldry.htm" title="Heraldry">heraldic</a> <!--del_lnk--> symbol. The axe has many forms and specialized uses but generally consists of an axe head with a <!--del_lnk--> handle, or <i>helve</i>.</p>
       <p>The earliest examples of axes have heads of <a href="../../wp/r/Rock_%2528geology%2529.htm" title="Rock (geology)">stone</a> with some form of wooden handle attached (<!--del_lnk--> hafted) in a method to suit the available materials and use. Axes made of <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>, <!--del_lnk--> bronze, <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> appeared as these technologies developed.</p>
       <p>The axe is an example of a <!--del_lnk--> simple machine, as it is a type of <!--del_lnk--> wedge, or dual <!--del_lnk--> inclined plane. This reduces the effort needed by the wood chopper. It splits the wood into two parts by the pressure concentration at the blade. The handle of the axe also acts as a <!--del_lnk--> lever allowing the user to increase the force at the cutting edge&mdash;not using the full length of the handle is known as choking the axe. For fine chopping using a side axe this sometimes is a positive effect, but for <!--del_lnk--> felling with a double bitted axe it reduces efficiency.</p>
       <p>Generally, cutting axes have a shallow wedge angle, whereas splitting axes have a deeper angle. Most axes are double bevelled, i.e. symmetrical about the axis of the blade, but some specialist <!--del_lnk--> broadaxes have a single bevel blade, and usually an offset handle that allows them to be used for finishing work without putting the user's knuckles at risk of injury. Less common today, they were once an integral part of a joiner and carpenter's tool kit, not just a tool for use in forestry. A tool of similar origin is the <!--del_lnk--> billhook. However in France and Holland the billhook often replaced the axe as a joiner's bench tool.</p>
       <p>Most modern axes have steel heads and wooden handles, typically <!--del_lnk--> hickory in the US and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Fraxinus.htm" title="Ash tree">ash</a> in Europe, although <a href="../../wp/p/Plastic.htm" title="Plastic">plastic</a> or <!--del_lnk--> fibreglass handles are also common. Modern axes are specialized by use, size and form. Hafted axes with short handles designed for use with one hand are often called hand axes but the term hand axe refers to axes without handles as well. <!--del_lnk--> Hatchets tend to be small hafted axes often with a <a href="../../wp/h/Hammer.htm" title="Hammer">hammer</a> on the back side ( the poll). As easy to make weapons, axes have frequently been used in combat.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Initially axes were probably not hafted. The first true hafted axes are known from the <!--del_lnk--> Mesolithic period (ca. 6000 BC). Axes made from ground stone are known since the <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic. Few wooden hafts have been found from this period, but it seems that the axe was normally hafted by wedging. <!--del_lnk--> Birch-tar and raw-hide lashings were used to fix the blade.</p>
       <p>Sometimes a short section of deer <!--del_lnk--> antler (an "antler sleeve") was used, which prevented the splitting of the haft and softened the impact on the stone blade itself, helping absorb the impact of each axe blow and lessening the chances of breaking the handle. The antler was hollowed out at one end to create a socket for the axehead. The antler sheath was then either perforated and a handle inserted into it or set in a hole made in the handle instead.</p>
       <p>The distribution of stone axes is an important indication of prehistoric trade. Thin sectioning is used to determine the provenance of the stone blades. In Europe, Neolithic 'axe factories', where thousands of ground stone axes were roughed out are known from many places, such as:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Great Langdale, Great Britain (tuff)</li>
        <li>Rathlin Island, Ireland (porcellanite)</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Krzemionki, Poland (flint)</li>
        <li>Plancher-les-Mines, France (pelite)</li>
        <li>Val de'Aoste, Italy (omphacite).</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Stone axes are still produced and in use today in parts of Irian Jaya, New Guinea. The Mount Hagen area was an important production centre.</p>
       <p>From the late Neolithic/Chalcolithic onwards, axes were made of copper or copper mixed with arsenic. These axes were flat and hafted much like their stone predecessors. Axes continued to be made in this manner with the introduction of Bronze metallurgy. Eventually the hafting method changed and the flat axe developed into the &lsquo;flanged axe,&rsquo; then <!--del_lnk--> palstaves, and later winged and socketed axes.</p>
       <p>The Proto-Indo-European word for "axe" may have been pelek'u- (Greek pelekus &pi;&#x3AD;&lambda;&epsilon;&kappa;&upsilon;&sigmaf;, Sanskrit parashu, see also <!--del_lnk--> Parashurama), but the word was probably a loan, or a Neolithic wanderwort, ultimately related to Sumerian balag, Akkadian pilaku- .</p>

       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Symbolism.2C_ritual.2C_and_folklore">Symbolism, ritual, and folklore</span></h2>
       <p>At least since the late Neolithic, elaborate axes (battle-axes, T-axes, etc.) had a <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religious</a> significance and probably indicated the exalted <!--del_lnk--> status of their owner. Certain types almost never show traces of wear; deposits of unshafted axe blades from the middle Neolithic (such as at the <!--del_lnk--> Somerset Levels in Britain) may have been gifts to the <a href="../../wp/d/Deity.htm" title="Deity">deities</a>.</p>
       <p>In Minoan Crete, the double axe (<!--del_lnk--> labrys) had a special significance, used by women priests in religious ceremonies. And the symbol refers to deification ceremonies; part of the leaping over the bull symbol also found at Crete; whereby aspirant becomes able to speak as a God to create any reality; the symbol being really a sky map.</p>
       <p>In 1998 a labrys, complete with an elaborately embellished haft, was found at Cham-Eslen, <!--del_lnk--> Canton of Zug, <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. The haft was 120&nbsp;cm long and wrapped in ornamented birch-bark. The axe blade is 17.4&nbsp;cm long and made of <!--del_lnk--> antigorite, mined in the <!--del_lnk--> Gotthard-area. The haft goes through a biconical drilled hole and is fastened by wedges of antler and by birch-tar. It belongs to the early <!--del_lnk--> Cortaillod culture.</p>
       <p>In the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> fasces</i>, the axe symbolized the <!--del_lnk--> authority to execute and were often used as symbols for <!--del_lnk--> Fascist Italy under Mussolini.</p>

       <p>In <a href="../../wp/f/Folklore.htm" title="Folklore">folklore</a>, stone axes were sometimes believed to be <!--del_lnk--> thunderbolts and were used to guard buildings against <!--del_lnk--> lightning, as it was believed (<!--del_lnk--> mythically) that lightning never struck the same place twice. This has caused some skewing of axe distributions.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">Steel</a> axes were important in <!--del_lnk--> superstition as well. A thrown axe could keep off a <!--del_lnk--> hailstorm, sometimes an axe was placed in the <!--del_lnk--> crops, with the cutting edge to the skies to protect the harvest against bad <a href="../../wp/w/Weather.htm" title="Weather">weather</a>. An upright axe buried under the <!--del_lnk--> sill of a house would keep off <!--del_lnk--> witches, while an axe under the bed would assure <!--del_lnk--> male <!--del_lnk--> offspring.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/b/Basque_people.htm" title="Basque people">Basques</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australians</a> and New Zealanders have developed variants of rural sports that perpetuate the traditions of log cutting with axe. The Basque variants, splitting horizontally or vertically disposed logs, are generically called <i><!--del_lnk--> aizkolaritza</i> (from <i>aizkora</i>: axe).</p>
       <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; mythology, the oshe (double-headed axe) symbolizes <!--del_lnk--> Shango, <!--del_lnk--> Orisha (god) of thunder and lightning. It is said to represent swift and balanced justice. Shango altars often contain a carved figure of a woman holding a gift to the god with a double-bladed axe sticking up from her head.<br style="clear:both;" />

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>The axe has two primary components: the axe <i>head</i>, and the <i>haft</i>.</p>
       <p>The <i>axe head</i> is typically bounded by the <i>bit</i> (or blade) at one end, and the <i>poll</i> (or butt) at the other, though some designs feature two bits opposite each other. The top corner of the bit where the cutting edge begins is called the <i>toe</i>, and the bottom corner is known as the <i>heel</i>. Either side of the head is called the <i>cheek</i>, which is sometimes supplemented by <i>lugs</i> where the head meets the haft, and the hole where the haft is mounted is called the <i>eye</i>. The part of the bit that descends below the rest of the axe-head is called the beard, and a <i>bearded axe</i> is an antiquated axe head with an exaggerated beard that can sometimes extend the cutting edge twice the height of the rest of the head.</p>
       <p>The <i>axe haft</i> is sometimes called the handle. Traditionally, it was made of a resilient hardwood like hickory or ash, but modern axes often have hafts made of durable synthetic materials. Antique axes and their modern reproductions, like the <!--del_lnk--> tomahawk, often had a simple, straight haft with a circular cross-section that wedged onto the axe-head without the aid of wedges or pins. Modern hafts are curved for better grip and to aid in the swinging motion, and are mounted securely to the head. The <i>shoulder</i> is where the head mounts onto the haft, and this is either a long oval or rectangular cross-section of the haft that's secured to the axe head with small metal or wooden wedges. The <i>belly</i> of the haft is the longest part, where it bows in gently, and the throat is where it curves sharply down to the short <i>grip</i>, just before the end of the haft, which is known as the <i>knob</i>.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Felling axe</b> &ndash; Cuts across the grain of wood, as in the <!--del_lnk--> felling of trees. In single or double bit (the bit is the cutting edge of the head) forms and many different weights, shapes, handle types and cutting geometries to match the characteristics of the material being cut. More so than with for instance a splitting axe, the bit of a felling axe needs to be very sharp, to be able to efficiently cut the fibres.</li>
        <li><b>Splitting axe</b> &ndash; Used in <!--del_lnk--> wood splitting to split with the grain of the wood. Splitting axe bits are more wedge shaped. This shape causes the axe to rend the fibres of the wood apart, without having to cut through them.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Broad axe</b> &ndash; Used with the grain of the wood in precision splitting or "<!--del_lnk--> hewing" (i.e. the squaring-off of round timbers usually for use in construction). Broad axe bits are most commonly <!--del_lnk--> chisel-shaped (i.e. one flat and one beveled edge) facilitating more controlled work as the flat cheek passes across the squared timber.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Adze</b> &ndash; A variation featuring a head perpendicular to that of an axe. Rather than splitting wood side-by-side, it is used to rip a level surface into a horizontal piece of wood. It can also be used as a <!--del_lnk--> pickaxe for breaking up rocks and <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clay</a>.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Hatchet</b> &ndash; A small, light axe designed for use in one hand specifically while camping or travelling.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Carpenter's axe</b> &ndash; A small axe, usually slightly larger than a hatchet, used in traditional woodwork, joinery and log-building. It has a pronounced beard and finger notch to allow a "choked" grip for precise control. The poll is designed for use as a hammer.</li>
        <li><b>Hand axe</b> &ndash; A small axe used for intermediate chopping, similar to hatchets.</li>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> Mortising Axe - Used for creating mortises, a process which begins by drilling two holes at the ends of the intended mortise. Then the wood between the holes is removed with the mortising axe. Some forms of the tool have one blade, which may be pushed, swung or struck with a mallet. Others, such as twybil, bisaig&uuml;e and piochon have two, one of which is used for separating the fibres, and the other for levering out the waste.</li>

        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Battle axe</b> &ndash; In its most common form, an arm-length weapon borne in one or both hands.

        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Pulaski</b> &ndash; An axe with a <!--del_lnk--> mattock blade built into the rear of the main axe blade, used for digging ('grubbing out') through and around roots as well as chopping. In addition to the McCloud (a tool similar to a hoe/rake combination), the pulaski is an indispensable tool used in fighting <!--del_lnk--> forest fires, as well as trail-building, brush clearance and similar functions.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Splitting maul</b> &ndash; A splitting implement that has evolved from the simple 'wedge' design to more complex designs. Some mauls have a conical 'axehead'; compound mauls have swiveling 'sub-wedges', among other types; others have a heavy wedge-shaped head, with a <!--del_lnk--> sledgehammer face opposite.</li>
        <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Slater's axe</b> &ndash; An axe for cutting roofing <!--del_lnk--> slate, with a long point on the poll for punching nail holes, and with the blade offset laterally from the handle to protect the worker's hand from flying slate chips.</li>

       <p>Hammer axes (or axe-hammers) typically feature an extended poll, opposite the blade, shaped and sometimes hardened for use as a <a href="../../wp/h/Hammer.htm" title="Hammer">hammer</a>. The name axe-hammer is often applied to a characteristic shape of perforated stone axe used in the <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic and <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Ages</a>. Iron axe-hammers are found in Roman military contexts, e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Cramond, <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and <!--del_lnk--> South Shields, <!--del_lnk--> Tyne and Wear.</p>
       <p>Today they are used in many different fields of work, completing all jobs from splitting wood to removing engines from vans. <a href="../../wp/t/Tungsten.htm" title="Tungsten">Tungsten</a> is often added for weight as an upgrade, as well as six foot handles for the heavier jobs that require added force and "massive blows" such as cutting automobile frames, slicing brake rotors, rough body work, home construction, home de-construction, etc.</p>
