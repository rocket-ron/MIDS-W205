       <p><b>Association football</b>, commonly known as <b>football</b> or <b>soccer</b>, is a <!--del_lnk--> sport played between two teams of typically eleven <!--del_lnk--> players, though other variations in player numbers such as <!--del_lnk--> 5 and 7 are also played, with a spherical <!--del_lnk--> ball. At the turn of the 21st century, the game was played by over 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular <!--del_lnk--> field of grass or green <!--del_lnk--> artificial turf, with a <!--del_lnk--> goal in the middle of each of the short ends. The object of the game is to score by kicking the ball into the opposing goal.</p>
       <p>The game is played at all levels, from unrefereed teams of a few (not necessarily as many as eleven) children without spectators in a field of any size, with pairs of coats as goalposts and not strictly conforming to the rules, to strictly-regulated games between teams of highly-competent professional players before enthusiastic crowds of <!--del_lnk--> 100,000 or more in a purpose-built <!--del_lnk--> stadium.</p>
       <p>In general play, the <!--del_lnk--> goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms (unless the ball is carried out of play, where the field players are required to restart by a throw-in of the game ball), while the field players typically use their feet to <!--del_lnk--> kick the ball, occasionally using other parts of their legs, their torso, or their head. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a <!--del_lnk--> draw is declared or the game goes into <!--del_lnk--> extra time and/or a <!--del_lnk--> penalty shootout, depending on the format of the competition. The <!--del_lnk--> Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by <!--del_lnk--> The Football Association in 1863 and have evolved since then. Association football is governed internationally by the <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA.htm" title="FIFA">International Federation of Association Football</a> (FIFA; <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de Football Association</i></span>), which organises the <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA_World_Cup.htm" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> every four years.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology_and_names">Etymology and names</span></h2>
       <p>The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name <i>association football</i> was coined to distinguish the game from the <a href="../../wp/f/Football.htm" title="Football">other forms of football</a> played at the time, specifically <a href="../../wp/r/Rugby_football.htm" title="Rugby football">rugby football</a>. The term <i>soccer</i> originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an <!--del_lnk--> Oxford "-er" abbreviation of the word "association".</p>
       <p>Within the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English-speaking world">English-speaking world</a>, association football is now usually called <i>football</i> in the United Kingdom, and mainly <i>soccer</i> in Canada and the United States. Other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, may use either or both terms.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the <!--del_lnk--> Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball (of 71&nbsp;cm (28&nbsp;in) circumference in FIFA play), known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> football</i> (or <i>soccer ball</i>). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a <!--del_lnk--> captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.</p>
       <p>The primary law is that players other than <!--del_lnk--> goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they do use their hands during a <!--del_lnk--> throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, "heading" with the forehead) other than their hands or arms. Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though the ball cannot be received in an <!--del_lnk--> offside position.</p>
       <p>In typical game play, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by <!--del_lnk--> dribbling, passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through <!--del_lnk--> tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the <!--del_lnk--> referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.</p>
       <p>At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> 2005&ndash;06 season of the English <a href="../../wp/p/Premier_League.htm" title="Premier League">Premier League</a> produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of <!--del_lnk--> specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: <!--del_lnk--> strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; <!--del_lnk--> defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and <!--del_lnk--> midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball in order to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, in order to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a <!--del_lnk--> <i>formation</i>. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's <!--del_lnk--> manager.</p>

       <p>Games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in many countries throughout history, such as <!--del_lnk--> woggabaliri in Australia, <!--del_lnk--> harpastum in the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> cuju in China. The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely <!--del_lnk--> varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to <!--del_lnk--> at least the eighth century.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at <a href="../../wp/t/Trinity_College%252C_Cambridge.htm" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, at a meeting attended by representatives from <!--del_lnk--> Eton, <!--del_lnk--> Harrow, <!--del_lnk--> Rugby, <!--del_lnk--> Winchester and <!--del_lnk--> Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the <!--del_lnk--> Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to formation of a <!--del_lnk--> Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, <!--del_lnk--> John Charles Thring of <!--del_lnk--> Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.</p>
       <p>These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of <!--del_lnk--> The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the <!--del_lnk--> Freemasons' Tavern in <!--del_lnk--> Great Queen Street, London. The only school to be represented on this occasion was <!--del_lnk--> Charterhouse. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from <!--del_lnk--> Blackheath, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other <!--del_lnk--> English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the <!--del_lnk--> Rugby Football Union. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of <!--del_lnk--> Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game. These rules included handling of the ball by "marks" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to <a href="../../wp/a/Australian_rules_football.htm" title="Australian rules football">Victorian rules football</a> being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.</p>
       <p>The laws of the game are currently determined by the <!--del_lnk--> International Football Association Board (IFAB). The Board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> of The Football Association, the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Football Association, the <!--del_lnk--> Football Association of Wales, and the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Football Association. The world's oldest football competition is the <a href="../../wp/f/FA_Cup.htm" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a>, which was founded by <!--del_lnk--> C. W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The <!--del_lnk--> first official international football match took place in 1872 between Scotland and England in <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is home to the world's first <!--del_lnk--> football league, which was founded in <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> in 1888 by <!--del_lnk--> Aston Villa director <!--del_lnk--> William McGregor. The original format contained 12 clubs from the <!--del_lnk--> Midlands and the <!--del_lnk--> North of England. <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA.htm" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association. The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the <!--del_lnk--> International Football Association Board in 1913. The board currently consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.</p>
       <p>Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet. A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. Football has the highest global television audience in sport.</p>
       <p>In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual <!--del_lnk--> fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that people who are polite, modest or even humble in Europe fall easily into rage with playing or watching soccer games. The <!--del_lnk--> C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's <!--del_lnk--> civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of <!--del_lnk--> Bouak&eacute;, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the <!--del_lnk--> Football War in June 1969 between <a href="../../wp/e/El_Salvador.htm" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Honduras.htm" title="Honduras">Honduras</a>. The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, when a match between <!--del_lnk--> Dinamo Zagreb and <!--del_lnk--> Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Laws">Laws</span></h2>
       <p>There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the <!--del_lnk--> International Football Association Board (IFAB). In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Players.2C_equipment.2C_and_officials">Players, equipment, and officials</span></h3>
       <p>Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding <!--del_lnk--> substitutes), one of whom must be the <!--del_lnk--> goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the <!--del_lnk--> penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of <!--del_lnk--> positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.</p>
       <p>The basic equipment or <i><!--del_lnk--> kit</i> players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate <!--del_lnk--> shin guards. <!--del_lnk--> Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.</p>
       <p>A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in <!--del_lnk--> friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or <!--del_lnk--> timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match. IFAB recommends that "that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team." Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.</p>
       <div id="Match_officials">
       </div>
       <p>A game is officiated by a <!--del_lnk--> referee, who has "full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two <!--del_lnk--> assistant referees. In many high-level games there is also a <!--del_lnk--> fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pitch">Pitch</span></h3>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within <!--del_lnk--> IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in <!--del_lnk--> imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate <!--del_lnk--> metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though popular use tends to continue to use traditional units in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of <!--del_lnk--> metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.</p>
       <p>The length of the pitch for international adult matches is in the range of 100&ndash;110&nbsp;m (110&ndash;120&nbsp;yd) and the width is in the range of 64&ndash;75&nbsp;m (70&ndash;80&nbsp;yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90&ndash;120&nbsp;m (100&ndash;130&nbsp;yd) length and 45&ndash;90&nbsp;m (50&ndash;100&nbsp;yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. Although in 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105&nbsp;m (344&nbsp;ft) long and 68&nbsp;m (223&nbsp;ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for A international matches, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.</p>
       <p>The longer boundary lines are <i>touchlines</i>, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are <i>goal lines</i>. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line. The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 7.32&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;yd) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2.44&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.</p>
       <p>In front of each goal is an area known as the <!--del_lnk--> penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5&nbsp;m (18&nbsp;yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5&nbsp;m (18&nbsp;yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a <!--del_lnk--> penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at <!--del_lnk--> kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.</p>

       <p>A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is most commonly referred to as <i>stoppage time</i> or <i>injury time</i>, while <i>loss time</i> can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between <!--del_lnk--> Stoke and <!--del_lnk--> Aston Villa. Trailing 1&ndash;0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90&nbsp;minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also stands that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.</p>
       <p>In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock, some competitions may invoke <!--del_lnk--> replays. A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of <!--del_lnk--> penalty shootouts (known officially in the Laws of the Game as "kicks from the penalty mark") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count toward the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).</p>
       <p>In competitions using <!--del_lnk--> two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the <!--del_lnk--> away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.</p>
       <p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the <!--del_lnk--> IFAB experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (<i><!--del_lnk--> golden goal</i>), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (<i><!--del_lnk--> silver goal</i>). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in <!--del_lnk--> 1998 and <!--del_lnk--> 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was <!--del_lnk--> France's victory over <!--del_lnk--> Paraguay in 1998. <!--del_lnk--> Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating <!--del_lnk--> Czech Republic in the final of <!--del_lnk--> Euro 1996. Silver goal was used in <!--del_lnk--> Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ball_in_and_out_of_play">Ball in and out of play</span></h3>
       <p>Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are <i>ball in play</i> and <i>ball out of play</i>. From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:</p>

        </div>
       </div>
       <p>A <!--del_lnk--> foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of "penal fouls", punishable by a <!--del_lnk--> direct free kick or <!--del_lnk--> penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an <!--del_lnk--> indirect free kick. The referee may punish a player's or substitute's <!--del_lnk--> misconduct by a caution (<!--del_lnk--> yellow card) or sending-off (<!--del_lnk--> red card). A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a sending-off. A player given a yellow card is said to have been "booked", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been sent off, no substitute can be brought on in their place. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of "unsporting behaviour" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.</p>
       <p>Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as "playing an advantage". The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within "a few seconds". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.</p>
       <p>The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final. The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.</p>
       <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Off-field">Off-field</span></h4>
       <p>Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, <!--del_lnk--> doping, <!--del_lnk--> age fraud and <!--del_lnk--> match fixing. Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in further action than that which is in power of an on-field referee. Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.</p>
       <p>Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may range from fines, points deductions (in league competitions) to expulsion from competitions. For example, the English and Scottish leagues will often deduct 10 points from a team that enters <!--del_lnk--> financial administration.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Governing_bodies">Governing bodies</span></h2>
       <p>The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as <!--del_lnk--> futsal and <!--del_lnk--> beach soccer) is <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA.htm" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>. The FIFA headquarters are located in <a href="../../wp/z/Zurich.htm" title="Zurich">Zurich</a>. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Asia: <!--del_lnk--> Asian Football Confederation (AFC)</li>
        <li>Africa: <!--del_lnk--> Confederation of African Football (CAF)</li>
        <li>Europe: <!--del_lnk--> Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)</li>
        <li>North/Central America &amp; Caribbean: <!--del_lnk--> Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF)</li>
        <li>Oceania: <!--del_lnk--> Oceania Football Confederation (OFC)</li>
        <li>South America: <!--del_lnk--> Confederaci&oacute;n Sudamericana de F&uacute;tbol/Confedera&ccedil;&atilde;o Sul-americana de Futebol (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>National associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the <!--del_lnk--> F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Camerounaise de Football in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 208 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.</p>
       <p>While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the <!--del_lnk--> International Football Association Board, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.</p>

       <p>The major international competition in football is the <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA_World_Cup.htm" title="FIFA World Cup">World Cup</a>, organised by FIFA. This competition takes place over every four years. Approximately 190-200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period. The most recent tournament, the <!--del_lnk--> 2010 FIFA World Cup, was held in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July, the first to be held on the <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African</a> continent.</p>
       <p>There has been a <!--del_lnk--> football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles. Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup. Originally, the event was for amateurs only, however, since the <!--del_lnk--> 1984 Summer Olympics professional players have been permitted, albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides. Currently, the Olympic men's tournament is played at Under-23 level. In the past the Olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team;. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.</p>
       <p>After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the <!--del_lnk--> European Championship (UEFA), the <!--del_lnk--> Copa Am&eacute;rica (CONMEBOL), <!--del_lnk--> African Cup of Nations (CAF), the <!--del_lnk--> Asian Cup (AFC), the <!--del_lnk--> CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the <!--del_lnk--> OFC Nations Cup (OFC). The <!--del_lnk--> FIFA Confederations Cup is contested by the winners of all 6 continental championships, the current <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA_World_Cup.htm" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the <a href="../../wp/u/UEFA_Champions_League.htm" title="UEFA Champions League">UEFA Champions League</a> in Europe and the <!--del_lnk--> Copa Libertadores de Am&eacute;rica in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the <!--del_lnk--> FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Domestic_competitions">Domestic competitions</span></h2>
       <p>The governing bodies in each country operate <!--del_lnk--> league systems in a <!--del_lnk--> domestic season, normally comprising several <!--del_lnk--> divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into <!--del_lnk--> tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a <!--del_lnk--> round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be <!--del_lnk--> promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are <!--del_lnk--> relegated to a lower division. The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named <!--del_lnk--> Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for <i>Opening</i> and <i>Closing</i>), awarding a champion for each. The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more "cup" competitions organised on a <!--del_lnk--> knock-out basis.</p>
       <p>Some countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries and lower divisions, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues&nbsp;&ndash; the <a href="../../wp/p/Premier_League.htm" title="Premier League">Premier League</a> (England), <!--del_lnk--> La Liga (Spain), <!--del_lnk--> Serie A (Italy), the <!--del_lnk--> Bundesliga (Germany) and <!--del_lnk--> Ligue 1 (France)&nbsp;&ndash; attract most of the world's best players and each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of &pound;600 million/&euro;763 million/US$1.185 billion.</p>

       <p>Women have been playing association football since the first recorded women's game in 1895 in North London. It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom. This perception began to change in the 1970s with the breakthrough of organised women's association football. Association football is the most prominent <!--del_lnk--> team sport for women in several countries, and one of the few women's team sports with <!--del_lnk--> professional leagues.</p>
       <p>The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both <!--del_lnk--> national and <!--del_lnk--> international level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football faced many struggles throughout its fight for right. It had a "golden age" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches; this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971. The <!--del_lnk--> FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since.</p>
       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Variants_and_casual_play">Variants and casual play</span></h2>
       <p>Variants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. <!--del_lnk--> Five-a-side football) play in non-field environments (i.e. <!--del_lnk--> Beach soccer, <!--del_lnk--> Indoor soccer, and <!--del_lnk--> Futsal) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. <!--del_lnk--> Paralympic association football).</p>
       <p>One of the attractions of association football is that a <!--del_lnk--> casual game can be played with only minimal equipment &ndash; a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can often have team sizes that vary considerably from 11-a-side, use a limited and/or modified subset of the official rules, and are likely to be self-officiated by the players.</p>
