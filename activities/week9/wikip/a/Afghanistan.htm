It has a population of around 30 million inhabiting an area of approximately 647,500 km<sup>2</sup> (250,001&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), making it the <!--del_lnk--> 42nd most populous and <!--del_lnk--> 41st largest nation in the world. It is bordered by <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> in the south and the east, <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> in the west, <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan.htm" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tajikistan.htm" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a> in the north, and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> in the far northeast.</p>
       <p>Afghanistan has been an ancient focal point of the <a href="../../wp/s/Silk_Road.htm" title="Silk Road">Silk Road</a> and <!--del_lnk--> human migration. Archaeologists have found evidence of human habitation from as far back as the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Paleolithic. Urban <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a> may have begun in the area as early as 3,000 to 2,000 BCE. Sitting at an important <!--del_lnk--> geostrategic location that connects the Middle East culture with Central Asia and the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent, the land has been home to various peoples through the ages and witnessed many military campaigns, notably by <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>, and in modern era Western forces. The land also served as a source from which the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrians, <!--del_lnk--> Kushans, <!--del_lnk--> Hephthalites, <!--del_lnk--> Saffarids, <!--del_lnk--> Ghaznavids, <!--del_lnk--> Ghorids, <!--del_lnk--> Khiljis, <!--del_lnk--> Timurids, <a href="../../wp/m/Mughal_Empire.htm" title="Mughal Empire">Mughals</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Durranis, and others have risen to form major empires.</p>
       <p>The <a href="../../wp/p/Political_history.htm" title="Political history">political history</a> of the modern state of Afghanistan begins in 1709, when the <!--del_lnk--> Hotaki dynasty was established in <!--del_lnk--> Kandahar followed by <!--del_lnk--> Ahmad Shah Durrani's rise to power in 1747. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a <!--del_lnk--> buffer state in the "<!--del_lnk--> Great Game" between the <!--del_lnk--> British and <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Empire.htm" title="Russian Empire">Russian</a> empires. Following the 1919 <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Afghan War, <!--del_lnk--> King Amanullah began a European style modernization of the country but was stopped by the ultra-conservatives. During the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, after the <!--del_lnk--> withdrawal of the British from neighboring India in 1947, the United States and the Soviet Union began spreading influences in Afghanistan, which led to a bloody <!--del_lnk--> war between the US-backed <!--del_lnk--> mujahideen forces and the Soviet-backed Afghan government in which over a million Afghans lost their lives. This was followed by the 1990s <!--del_lnk--> civil war, the rise and fall of the <!--del_lnk--> extremist <!--del_lnk--> Taliban government and the <!--del_lnk--> 2001&ndash;present war. In December 2001, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_Security_Council.htm" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a> authorized the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to help maintain security in Afghanistan and assist the <!--del_lnk--> Karzai administration.</p>
       <p>Three decades of war made Afghanistan one of the world's most dangerous countries, including the largest producer of refugees and asylum seekers. While the international community is rebuilding war-torn Afghanistan, <!--del_lnk--> terrorist groups such as the <!--del_lnk--> Haqqani Network and <!--del_lnk--> Hezbi Islami are actively involved in a nationwide <!--del_lnk--> Taliban-led <!--del_lnk--> insurgency, which includes hundreds of <!--del_lnk--> assassinations and <!--del_lnk--> suicide attacks.

       <p>The name <i>Afgh&#x101;nist&#x101;n</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Persian: <span lang="fa">&#x627;&#x641;&#x63A;&#x627;&#x646;&#x633;&#x62A;&#x627;&#x646;</span>&lrm;, <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><!--del_lnk--> [av&#x263;&#x252;nest&#x252;n]</span>) means <i>"Land of the Afghans"</i>, which originates from the <!--del_lnk--> ethnonym <i>"<!--del_lnk--> Afghan"</i>. Historically, the name <i>"Afghan"</i> mainly designated the <a href="../../wp/p/Pashtun_people.htm" title="Pashtun people">Pashtun people</a>, the largest <!--del_lnk--> ethnic group of Afghanistan. This name is mentioned in the form of <i>Abgan</i> in the 3rd century CE by the <a href="../../wp/s/Sassanid_Empire.htm" title="Sassanid Empire">Sassanians</a> and as <i>Avagana</i> (<i><!--del_lnk--> Afghana</i>) in the 6th century CE by Indian astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Varahamihira. A people called the <i>Afghans</i> are mentioned several times in a 10th century <!--del_lnk--> geography book, <!--del_lnk--> Hudud al-'alam, particularly where a reference is made to a village: "Saul, a pleasant village on a mountain.

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Al-Biruni referred to them in the 11th century as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus River">Indus River</a>, which would be the <!--del_lnk--> Sulaiman Mountains. <a href="../../wp/i/Ibn_Battuta.htm" title="Ibn Battuta">Ibn Battuta</a>, a famous <!--del_lnk--> Moroccan scholar visiting the region in 1333, writes:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">

       </blockquote>
       <p>One prominent 16th-century Persian scholar explains extensively about the Afghans. For example, he writes:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">"The men of K&aacute;bul and <!--del_lnk--> Khilj also went home; and whenever they were questioned about the Musulm&aacute;ns of the Kohist&aacute;n (the mountains), and how matters stood there, they said, "Don't call it Kohist&aacute;n, but Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n; for there is nothing there but Afgh&aacute;ns and disturbances." Thus it is clear that for this reason the people of the country call their home in <!--del_lnk--> their own language Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n, and themselves Afgh&aacute;ns."</div>

       </blockquote>
       <p>It is widely accepted that the terms <i>"Pashtun"</i> and <i>Afghan</i> are <!--del_lnk--> synonyms. In the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet <!--del_lnk--> Khushal Khan Khattak it is mentioned:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">"Pull out your sword and slay any one, that says Pashtun and Afghan are not one! Arabs know this and so do Romans: Afghans are Pashtuns, Pashtuns are Afghans!"</div>
       </blockquote>
       <p>The last part of the name, <i><!--del_lnk--> -st&#x101;n</i> is a <!--del_lnk--> Persian <!--del_lnk--> suffix for "place". The name <i>"Afghanistan"</i> is described by the 16th century Mughal Emperor <a href="../../wp/b/Babur.htm" title="Babur">Babur</a> in his <!--del_lnk--> memoirs as well as by the later Persian scholar <!--del_lnk--> Firishta and Babur's descendants, referring to the traditional ethnic Pashtun territories between the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu Kush mountains and the Indus River. In the early 19th century, <!--del_lnk--> Afghan politicians decided to adopt the name <i>Afghanistan</i> for the entire <!--del_lnk--> Afghan Empire after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties with <!--del_lnk--> Qajarid Persia and <!--del_lnk--> British India. In 1857, in his review of <!--del_lnk--> J.W. Kaye's <i>The Afghan War</i>, <a href="../../wp/f/Friedrich_Engels.htm" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> describes "Afghanistan" as:</p>
       <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">"an extensive country of Asia...between Persia and the Indies, and in the other direction between the Hindu Kush and the Indian Ocean.

       </blockquote>
       <p>The Afghan kingdom was sometimes referred to as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Kabul</i>, as mentioned by the British statesman and historian <!--del_lnk--> Mountstuart Elphinstone. Afghanistan was officially recognized as a <!--del_lnk--> sovereign state by the international community after the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed.</p>

       <p>Despite having numerous rivers and <!--del_lnk--> reservoirs, large parts of the country are dry. The <!--del_lnk--> endorheic Sistan Basin is one of the driest regions in the world. Aside from the usual rain falls, Afghanistan receives <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a> during winter in the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu Kush and <!--del_lnk--> Pamir Mountains, and the melting snow in the spring season enters the <!--del_lnk--> rivers, lakes, and streams. However, two-thirds of the country's water flows into neighboring countries of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan. The state needs more than <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$2 billion</span> to rehabilitate its irrigation systems so that the water is properly managed.</p>
       <p>The northeastern Hindu Kush <!--del_lnk--> mountain range, in and around the <!--del_lnk--> Badakhshan Province of Afghanistan, is in a <!--del_lnk--> geologically active area where <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a> may occur almost every year. They can be deadly and destructive sometimes, causing <!--del_lnk--> landslides in some parts or <!--del_lnk--> avalanche during winter. The last strong earthquakes were in <!--del_lnk--> 1998, which killed about 6,000 people in Badakhshan near Tajikistan. This was followed by the <!--del_lnk--> 2002 Hindu Kush earthquakes in which over 150 people of various regional countries were killed and over 1,000 injured. The <!--del_lnk--> 2010 earthquake left 11 Afghans dead, over 70 injured and more than 2,000 houses destroyed.</p>

       <p>After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan, among them were many <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European-speaking <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Iranians. These tribes later migrated further south to India, west to what is now Iran, and towards Europe via the area north of the Caspian. The region as a whole was called <!--del_lnk--> Ariana.</p>
       <p>The ancient religion of <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder <a href="../../wp/z/Zoroaster.htm" title="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a> is thought to have lived and died in <!--del_lnk--> Balkh. Ancient <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Iranian languages may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenid Persians overthrew the <!--del_lnk--> Medes and incorporated Afghanistan (<!--del_lnk--> Arachosia, <!--del_lnk--> Aria and <!--del_lnk--> Bactria) within its boundaries.

       <p>The Mauryans brought <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush until about 185 BCE when they were overthrown.

By 1713, Mir Wais had decisively defeated two larger Persian armies, one was led by <!--del_lnk--> Khusraw Kh&aacute;n (nephew of Gurgin) and the other by Rustam Kh&aacute;n. The armies were sent by <!--del_lnk--> Sultan Husayn, the Shah in <!--del_lnk--> Isfahan (now Iran), to re-take control of the Kandahar region. Mir Wais died of a natural cause in 1715 and was succeeded by his brother <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Aziz, who was killed by Mir Wais' son <!--del_lnk--> Mahmud as a national traitor. In 1722, Mahmud led an Afghan army to the Persian capital of Isfahan, sacked the city after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Gulnabad and proclaimed himself <!--del_lnk--> King of Persia. The Persians were disloyal to the Afghan rulers, and after the massacre of thousands of religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family, the Hotaki dynasty was ousted from Persia after the 1729 <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Damghan.</p>

       <p>In 1738, <!--del_lnk--> Nader Shah and his <!--del_lnk--> Afsharid forces captured Kandahar from Shah <!--del_lnk--> Hussain Hotaki, at which point the incarcerated 16 year old <!--del_lnk--> Ahmad Shah Durrani was freed and made the commander of Nader Shah's four thousand <!--del_lnk--> Abdali Afghans. From Kandahar they set out to conquer India, passing through Ghazni, Kabul, Peshawar, and <!--del_lnk--> Lahore, and ultimately plundering <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Karnal. Nader Shah and his army abandoned Delhi but took with them huge treasure, which included the <!--del_lnk--> Koh-i-Noor and <!--del_lnk--> Darya-ye Noor diamonds. After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, the Afghans chose Ahmad Shah Durrani as their <!--del_lnk--> head of state. Regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan, Durrani and his Afghan army conquered the entire present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, <!--del_lnk--> Khorasan and <!--del_lnk--> Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with Delhi in India. He defeated the Indian <!--del_lnk--> Maratha Empire, one of his biggest victories was the <!--del_lnk--> 1761 Battle of Panipat.</p>
       <p>In October 1772, Ahmad Shah Durrani died of a natural cause and was buried at a site now adjacent to the <!--del_lnk--> Shrine of the Cloak in Kandahar. He was succeeded by his son, <!--del_lnk--> Timur Shah, who transferred the capital of Afghanistan from Kandahar to Kabul in 1776. After Timur Shah's death in 1793, the Durrani throne was passed down to his son <!--del_lnk--> Zaman Shah followed by <!--del_lnk--> Mahmud Shah, <!--del_lnk--> Shuja Shah and others.</p>
       <p>The Afghan Empire was under threat in the early 19th century by the <!--del_lnk--> Persians in the west and the <!--del_lnk--> Sikhs in the east. The western provinces of Khorasan and Kohistan were taken by the Persians in 1800. Fateh Khan, leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Barakzai tribe, had installed 21 of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire. After his death, they rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves. During this turbulent period, Afghanistan had many temporary rulers until <!--del_lnk--> Dost Mohammad Khan declared himself emir in 1826. The <!--del_lnk--> Punjab region was lost to <!--del_lnk--> Ranjit Singh, who invaded <!--del_lnk--> Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in 1834 captured the city of <!--del_lnk--> Peshawar. In 1837, <!--del_lnk--> Akbar Khan and the Afghan army crossed the <!--del_lnk--> Khyber Pass to defeat the Sikhs at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Jamrud, killing <!--del_lnk--> Hari Singh Nalwa before retreating to Kabul. By this time the <!--del_lnk--> British were advancing from the east and the <!--del_lnk--> First Anglo-Afghan War, one of the first major conflicts during the <!--del_lnk--> Great Game, was initiated.</p>

       </div>
       <p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Third Anglo-Afghan War and the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Rawalpindi in 1919, King <!--del_lnk--> Amanullah Khan declared Afghanistan a <!--del_lnk--> sovereign and fully <!--del_lnk--> independent state. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927&ndash;28 tour of Europe and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was <!--del_lnk--> Mahmud Tarzi, an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 <!--del_lnk--> constitution, which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a> was abolished in 1923.</p>
       <p>Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional <!--del_lnk--> burqa for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by <!--del_lnk--> Habibullah Kalakani. Prince <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Nadir Shah, Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favour of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in 1933 by <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Khaliq, a <!--del_lnk--> Hazara school student.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Zahir Shah, Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, <!--del_lnk--> Shah Mahmud Khan, became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Daoud Khan, the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, nor aligned with either power bloc in the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports and other vital infrastructure. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first <!--del_lnk--> President of Afghanistan.</p>

       <p>In April 1978, the communist <!--del_lnk--> People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the <!--del_lnk--> Saur Revolution. Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a <!--del_lnk--> civil war waged by guerrilla <!--del_lnk--> mujahideen against government forces countrywide. The <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistani</a> government provided these rebels with covert training centers, while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government. Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA&nbsp;&mdash; the dominant <!--del_lnk--> Khalq and the more moderate <!--del_lnk--> Parcham&nbsp;&mdash; resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup. By mid-1979, the United States had started a covert program to assist the mujahideen.</p>
       <p>In September 1979, Khalqist President <!--del_lnk--> Nur Muhammad Taraki was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member <!--del_lnk--> Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's <!--del_lnk--> Babrak Karmal but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.</p>
       <p>At the time some believed the Soviets were attempting to expand their borders southward in order to gain a foothold in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>. The Soviet Union had long lacked a <!--del_lnk--> warm water port, and their movement south seemed to position them for further expansion toward <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> in the East, and <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> to the West. American politicians, Republicans and Democrats alike, feared the Soviets were positioning themselves for a takeover of <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle Eastern</a> oil. Others believed that the Soviet Union was afraid Iran's <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Revolution and Afghanistan's <!--del_lnk--> Islamization would spread to the millions of Muslims in the USSR. The PDPA prohibited <!--del_lnk--> usury, made statements on <!--del_lnk--> women's rights by declaring equality of the sexes and introducing women to political life.</p>

       <p>After the invasion, President <a href="../../wp/j/Jimmy_Carter.htm" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> announced what became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Carter Doctrine: that the U.S. would not allow any other outside force to gain control of the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. He terminated the Soviet Wheat Deal in January 1980, which was intended to establish trade with USSR and lessen <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> tensions. The grain exports had been beneficial to people employed in agriculture, and the <!--del_lnk--> Carter embargo marked the beginning of hardship for American farmers. That same year, Carter also made two of the most unpopular decisions of his entire Presidency: prohibiting American athletes from participating in the <!--del_lnk--> 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, and reinstating registration for the <!--del_lnk--> draft for young males. Following the Soviet invasion, the United States supported diplomatic efforts to achieve a Soviet withdrawal. In addition, generous U.S. contributions to the refugee program in Pakistan played a major part in efforts to assist <!--del_lnk--> Afghan refugees.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Reagan administration increased arming and funding of the mujahideen as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Reagan Doctrine, thanks in large part to the efforts of <!--del_lnk--> Charlie Wilson and CIA officer <!--del_lnk--> Gust Avrakotos. Early reports estimated $6&ndash;20 billion but more recent reports suggest that up to $40 billion were provided by the U.S. and <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> to Pakistan. This was in the forms of cash and weapons, which included over two thousand <!--del_lnk--> FIM-92 Stinger <!--del_lnk--> surface-to-air missiles.</p>
       <p>The 10-year Soviet war resulted in the deaths of over 1 million Afghans, mostly civilians. About 6<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&nbsp;</span>million fled to <!--del_lnk--> Pakistan and <!--del_lnk--> Iran, and from there tens of thousands began emigrating to the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, <!--del_lnk--> United States, <!--del_lnk--> Australia and other parts of the world. Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties, the Soviets withdrew in 1989 but continued to support Afghan President <!--del_lnk--> Mohammad Najibullah until 1992.</p>

       <p>After the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords).

A publication by the <!--del_lnk--> George Washington University suggests "outside forces saw instability in Afghanistan as an opportunity to press their own security and political agendas". Conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a full-scale war.</p>
       <p>Due to the sudden initiation of the war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. Atrocities were committed by individuals of the different armed factions while Kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos as described in reports by Human Rights Watch and the Afghanistan Justice Project. Because of the chaos, some leaders increasingly had only nominal control over their (sub-)commanders. For civilians there was little security from murder, rape and extortion. An estimated 25,000 people died during the most intense period of bombardment by Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami and the <!--del_lnk--> Junbish-i Milli forces of <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Rashid Dostum, who had created an alliance with Hekmatyar in 1994.

       <p>Southern and eastern Afghanistan was under the control of local commanders such as <!--del_lnk--> Gul Agha Sherzai and others. In 1994, the <!--del_lnk--> Taliban (a movement originating from <!--del_lnk--> Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a political-religious force. When the Taliban took control of the city in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders. In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.</p>
       <p>In late 1994, most of the militia factions (Hezb-i Islami, Junbish-i Milli and Hezb-i Wahdat) which had been fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State's <!--del_lnk--> Minister of Defense <!--del_lnk--> Ahmad Shah Massoud.

       <p>The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the Islamic State government under Ahmad Shah Massoud. <a href="../../wp/a/Amnesty_International.htm" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a>, referring to the Taliban offensive, wrote in a 1995 report: "This is the first time in several months that Kabul civilians have become the targets of rocket attacks and shelling aimed at residential areas in the city."</p>
       <p>The Taliban's early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of defeats that resulted in heavy losses which led analysts to believe the Taliban movement had run its course. But Pakistan provided increased support to the Taliban. Many analysts like <!--del_lnk--> Amin Saikal describe the Taliban as developing into a proxy force for Pakistan's regional interests. On 26 September 1996, as the Taliban with military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia prepared for another major offensive, Massoud ordered a full retreat from Kabul. The Taliban seized Kabul on 27 September 1996, and established the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. They imposed on the parts of Afghanistan under their control their political and judicial interpretation of Islam issuing edicts especially targeting women. According to <!--del_lnk--> Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), "no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest, prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment."</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on 27 September 1996, Ahmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum, two former enemies, created the <!--del_lnk--> United Front (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum. The United Front included beside the dominantly <!--del_lnk--> Tajik forces of Massoud and the <!--del_lnk--> Uzbek forces of Dostum, <!--del_lnk--> Hazara factions under the command of leaders such as <!--del_lnk--> Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq and <a href="../../wp/p/Pashtun_people.htm" title="Pashtun people">Pashtun</a> forces under the leadership of commanders such as <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Haq or Haji <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Qadir. The Taliban defeated Dostum's Junbish forces militarily by seizing Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998. Dostum subsequently went into exile.</p>
       <p>According to a 55-page report by the United Nations, the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians. UN officials stated that there had been "15 massacres" between 1996 and 2001 and that "[t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself." The Taliban especially targeted people of Shia religious or Hazara ethnic background. Upon taking Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, 4,000&ndash;6,000 civilians were killed by the Taliban and many more reported <!--del_lnk--> tortured. The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings. Bin Laden's so-called <!--del_lnk--> 055 Brigade was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians. The report by the UN quotes "eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people".</p>

       <p>President <a href="../../wp/p/Pervez_Musharraf.htm" title="Pervez Musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a>&nbsp;&ndash; then as Chief of Army Staff&nbsp;&ndash; was responsible for sending thousands of Pakistanis to fight alongside the Taliban and bin Laden against the forces of Massoud. According to Pakistani Afghanistan expert <!--del_lnk--> Ahmed Rashid, "between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan" on the side of the Taliban. In 2001 alone, there were believed to be 28,000 Pakistani nationals, many either from the <!--del_lnk--> Frontier Corps or army, fighting inside Afghanistan. An estimated 8,000 Pakistani militants were recruited in <!--del_lnk--> madrassas filling the ranks of the estimated 25,000 regular Taliban force. A 1998 document by the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. State Department confirms that "20&ndash;40&nbsp;% of [regular] Taliban soldiers are Pakistani." The document further stated that the parents of those Pakistani nationals "know nothing regarding their child's military involvement with the Taliban until their bodies are brought back to Pakistan."</p>
       <p>From 1996 to 2001 the <!--del_lnk--> al-Qaeda terrorist network of <a href="../../wp/o/Osama_bin_Laden.htm" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Ayman al-Zawahiri became a state within Afghanistan. Bin Laden sent Arab recruits to join the fight against the United Front. 3,000 fighters of the regular Taliban army were Arab and Central Asian militants. In total, of roughly 45,000 Pakistani, Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers fighting against the forces of Massoud in mid-2001, only 14,000 were Afghans.</p>

       <p>Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan. In the areas under his control Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/Women%2527s_rights.htm" title="Women's Rights">Women's Rights</a> Declaration. Human Rights Watch cites no human rights crimes for the forces under direct control of Massoud for the period from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001. As a consequence many civilians fled to the area of Ahmad Shah Massoud. In total, estimates range up to one million people fleeing the Taliban. <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic concluded in its documentary <i>"Inside the Taliban"</i>: "The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is Ahmad Shah Massoud."</p>
       <p>In early 2001 Massoud addressed the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Parliament.htm" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> in Brussels asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan. He stated that the Taliban and al-Qaeda had introduced "a very wrong perception of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>" and that without the support of Pakistan and bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year. On this visit to Europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent.</p>
       <p>On 9 September 2001, Ahmad Shah Massoud was assassinated by two Arab <!--del_lnk--> suicide attackers inside Afghanistan and two days later about 3,000 people were killed in the <a href="../../wp/s/September_11_attacks.htm" title="September 11 attacks">September 11 attacks</a> in the United States. The US government identified Osama bin Laden, <!--del_lnk--> Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the Al-Qaeda organization based in and allied to the Taliban's <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the perpetrators of the attacks. From 1990 until this date over 400,000 Afghan civilians had already died in the wars in Afghanistan. The Taliban refused to hand over bin Laden to US authorities and to disband al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan. Bin Laden later claimed sole responsibility for the September 11 attacks and specifically denied any prior knowledge of them by the Taliban or the Afghan people. In October 2001, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/w/War_in_Afghanistan_%25282001%25E2%2580%2593present%2529.htm" title="War in Afghanistan (2001-present)">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> was launched as a new phase of the <!--del_lnk--> war in Afghanistan in which teams of American and British special forces worked with ground forces of the United Front (Northern Alliance) to remove the Taliban from power and dispel Al-Qaeda. At the same time the US-led forces were bombing Taliban and al-Qaida targets everywhere inside Afghanistan with <!--del_lnk--> cruise missiles. These actions led to the <!--del_lnk--> fall of Mazar-i-Sharif in the north followed by all the other cities, as the Taliban and al-Qaida fled over the <!--del_lnk--> porous <!--del_lnk--> Durand Line border into Pakistan. In December 2001, after the Taliban government was toppled and the new <!--del_lnk--> Afghan government under <!--del_lnk--> Hamid Karzai was formed, the <!--del_lnk--> International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was established by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/u/United_Nations_Security_Council.htm" title="UN Security Council">UN Security Council</a> to help assist the <!--del_lnk--> Karzai administration and provide basic security to the <!--del_lnk--> Afghan people.</p>

       <p>While the Taliban began regrouping inside Pakistan, more coalition troops entered the escalating US-led war. Meanwhile, the rebuilding of war-torn Afghanistan kicked off in 2002. The Afghan nation was able to build democratic structures over the years, and some progress was made in key areas such as governance, economy, health, education, transport, and agriculture. NATO is training the <!--del_lnk--> Afghan armed forces as well its <!--del_lnk--> national police. ISAF and <!--del_lnk--> Afghan troops led many offensives against the Taliban but failed to fully defeat them. By 2009, a Taliban-led shadow government began to form in many parts of the country complete with their own version of mediation court. After U.S. President <a href="../../wp/b/Barack_Obama.htm" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> announced the deployment of another 30,000 soldiers in 2010 for a period of two years, <i><!--del_lnk--> Der Spiegel</i> published images of the <!--del_lnk--> US soldiers who killed unarmed Afghan civilians.</p>
       <p>At the <!--del_lnk--> 2010 International Conference on Afghanistan in London, <!--del_lnk--> Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he intends to reach out to the Taliban leadership (including <!--del_lnk--> Mullah Omar, <!--del_lnk--> Sirajuddin Haqqani and <!--del_lnk--> Gulbuddin Hekmatyar). Supported by NATO, Karzai called on the group's leadership to take part in a <!--del_lnk--> loya jirga meeting to initiate peace talks. These steps have resulted in an intensification of bombings, assassinations and ambushes. Some Afghan groups (including the former intelligence chief <!--del_lnk--> Amrullah Saleh and opposition leader Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Abdullah Abdullah) believe that Karzai plans to appease the insurgents' senior leadership at the cost of the democratic constitution, the democratic process and progress in the field of human rights especially women's rights. Dr. Abdullah stated:</p>

        <div class="Bug6200">I should say that Taliban are not fighting to be accommodated. They are fighting to bring the state down. So it's a futile exercise, and it's just misleading. ... There are groups that will fight to the death. Whether we like to talk to them or we don't like to talk to them, they will continue to fight. So, for them, I don't think that we have a way forward with talks or negotiations or contacts or anything as such. Then we have to be prepared to tackle and deal with them militarily. In terms of the Taliban on the ground, there are lots of possibilities and opportunities that with the help of the people in different parts of the country, we can attract them to the peace process; provided, we create a favorable environment on this side of the line. At the moment, the people are leaving support for the government because of corruption. So that expectation is also not realistic at this stage.</div>

This large return of Afghans may have helped the nation's economy but the country still remains one of the poorest in the world due to the decades of war, lack of foreign investment, <!--del_lnk--> ongoing government corruption and the <!--del_lnk--> Taliban insurgency. According to a report by the United Nations, the Taliban and other militants were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in 2009, 75% in 2010, 80% in 2011, 80% in 2012. In 2011 a record 3,021 civilians were killed in the ongoing insurgency, the fifth successive annual rise.</p>

Also in the same year, the <!--del_lnk--> Pak-Afghan border skirmishes intensified and many large scale attacks by the Pakistani-based <!--del_lnk--> Haqqani Network took place across Afghanistan.

       <p>In anticipation of the 2014 NATO withdrawal and a subsequent expected push to regain power by the Taliban, the anti-Taliban United Front (Northern Alliance) groups have started to regroup under the umbrella of the <!--del_lnk--> National Coalition of Afghanistan (political arm) and the <!--del_lnk--> National Front of Afghanistan (military arm).</p>

       <p>Afghanistan is an <a href="../../wp/i/Islamic_republic.htm" title="Islamic republic">Islamic republic</a> consisting of three branches, executive, legislative and judicial. The nation is currently led by <!--del_lnk--> Hamid Karzai as the President and <!--del_lnk--> leader since late 2001. The <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly is the legislature, a <!--del_lnk--> bicameral body having two chambers, the <!--del_lnk--> House of the People and the <!--del_lnk--> House of Elders.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court is led by <!--del_lnk--> Chief Justice <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Salam Azimi, a former university professor who had been a legal advisor to the president. The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more <!--del_lnk--> technocrats than the previous one, which was dominated by fundamentalist religious figures such as Chief Justice <!--del_lnk--> Faisal Ahmad Shinwari who issued several controversial rulings, including seeking to place a limit on the <!--del_lnk--> rights of women.</p>
       <p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Transparency International's corruption perceptions index 2010 results, Afghanistan was ranked as the third most-corrupt country in the world. A January 2010 report published by the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime revealed that bribery consumes an amount equal to 23% of the GDP of the nation. A number of <!--del_lnk--> government ministries are believed to be rife with corruption, and while President Karzai vowed to tackle the problem in late 2009 by stating that "individuals who are involved in corruption will have no place in the government", top government officials were stealing and misusing hundreds of millions of dollars through the <!--del_lnk--> Kabul Bank. Although the nation's institutions are newly formed and steps have been taken to arrest some, the United States warned that aid to Afghanistan would be reduced to very little if <!--del_lnk--> the corruption is not stopped.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 2004 Afghan presidential election was relatively peaceful, in which Hamid Karzai won in the first round with 55.4% of the votes. However, the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 presidential election was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout and widespread electoral fraud. The vote, along with elections for 420 <!--del_lnk--> provincial council seats, took place in August 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.</p>
       <p>Two months later, under international pressure, a second round run-off vote between Karzai and remaining challenger <!--del_lnk--> Abdullah was announced, but a few days later Abdullah announced that he is not participating in the 7 November run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met. The next day, officials of the election commission cancelled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President for another 5-year term.</p>
       <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 2005 parliamentary election, among the elected officials were former mujahideen, <!--del_lnk--> Islamic fundamentalists, warlords, communists, <!--del_lnk--> reformists, and several Taliban associates. In the same period, Afghanistan reached to the 30th nation in terms of female representation in parliament. The last <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary election was held in September 2010, but due to disputes and investigation of fraud, the sworn in ceremony took place in late January 2011. After the issuance of computerized ID cards for the first time, which is a $101 million project that the Afghan government plans to start in 2012, it is expected to help prevent major fraud in future elections and improve the security situation.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Administrative_divisions">Administrative divisions</span></h3>
       <p>Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (<i><!--del_lnk--> wilayats</i>), with each province having its own capital and a provincial administration. The provinces are further divided into about 398 smaller provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> provincial governors are appointed by the <!--del_lnk--> President of Afghanistan and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors. The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils which are elected through direct and general elections for a period of four years. The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.</p>
       <p>According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, <!--del_lnk--> mayors of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. However, due to huge election costs, mayoral and municipal elections have never been held. Instead, mayors have been appointed by the government. As for the capital city of Kabul, the mayor is appointed by the President of Afghanistan.</p>

       <p><!--del_lnk--> Afghanistan&ndash;Pakistan relations have been negatively affected by issues related to the <!--del_lnk--> Durand Line, the 1978&ndash;present <!--del_lnk--> war (i.e. Mujahideen, Afghan refugees, Taliban insurgency, and <!--del_lnk--> border skirmishes), including water and the growing <!--del_lnk--> influence of India in Afghanistan. Afghan officials often allege that Pakistani and Iranian intelligence agencies are involved in terrorist attacks inside Afghanistan, by training and guiding terrorists to carry out attacks. On the positive side, the two nations are usually described in Afghanistan as "inseparable brothers", which is due to historical, religious, and ethnolinguistical connections, as well as trade and other ties. Afghanistan has always depended on Pakistani trade routes for import and export but this has changed in the last decade with the opening of Central Asian and Iranian routes. Conversely, Pakistan depends on <!--del_lnk--> Afghan water and considers Afghanistan as the only trade route to Central Asian resources.</p>
       <p>India and Iran have actively participated in reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, with India being the largest regional donor to the country. Since 2002, India has pledged up to $2 billion in economic assistance to Afghanistan and has participated in multiple socio-economic reconstruction efforts, including power, roads, agricultural and educational projects. There are also military ties between Afghanistan and India, which is expected to increase after the October 2011 strategic pact that was signed by President Karzai and <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Manmohan Singh.</p>
       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> military of Afghanistan is under the <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of Defense, which includes the <!--del_lnk--> Afghan National Army (ANA) and the <!--del_lnk--> Afghan Air Force (AAF). It currently has about 200,000 active soldiers and is expected to reach 260,000 in the coming years. They are <!--del_lnk--> trained and equipped by NATO countries, mainly by the <!--del_lnk--> United States Department of Defense. The ANA is divided into 7 major <!--del_lnk--> Corps, with the <!--del_lnk--> 201st Selab ("Flood") in Kabul followed by the 203rd in Gardez, <!--del_lnk--> 205th Atul ("Hero") in Kandahar, 207th in Herat, 209th in Mazar-i-Sharif and the 215th in Lashkar Gah. The ANA also has a <!--del_lnk--> commando brigade which was established in 2007. The <!--del_lnk--> National Military Academy of Afghanistan serves as the main educational institute for the militarymen of the country. A new $200 million <!--del_lnk--> Afghan Defense University (ADU) is under construction near the capital.</p>

       <p>The police are being trained by <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> countries through the <!--del_lnk--> Afghanistan Police Program. According to a 2009 news report, a large proportion of police officers are illiterate and are accused of demanding bribes. Jack Kem, deputy to the commander of NATO Training Mission Afghanistan and Combined Security Transition Command Afghanistan, stated that the literacy rate in the ANP will rise to over 50% by January 2012. What began as a voluntary literacy program became mandatory for basic police training in early 2011. Approximately 17% of them test positive for illegal drug use. In 2009, President Karzai created two anti-corruption units within the Interior Ministry. Former Interior Minister <!--del_lnk--> Hanif Atmar said that security officials from the U.S. (<a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.htm" title="FBI">FBI</a>), Britain (<!--del_lnk--> Scotland Yard) and the European Union will train prosecutors in the unit.</p>
       <p>The south and eastern parts of Afghanistan are the most dangerous due to the flourishing drug trade and militancy. These areas in particular are often patrolled by <!--del_lnk--> Taliban insurgents, and in many cases they plan attacks by using suicide bombers and planting <!--del_lnk--> improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on roads. Kidnapping and robberies are also often reported. Every year <!--del_lnk--> many Afghan police officers are killed in the line of duty in these areas. The <!--del_lnk--> Afghan Border Police are responsible for protecting the nation's airports and borders, especially the disputed <!--del_lnk--> Durand Line border which is often used by members of criminal organizations and terrorists for their illegal activities. Reports in 2011 suggested that up to 3 million people are involved in the illegal drug business in Afghanistan, many of the attacks on government employees and institutions are carried out not only by the Taliban militants but also by powerful criminal gangs. Drugs from Afghanistan are exported to Iran, Pakistan, Russia, India, the United Arab Emirate, and the European Union. The <!--del_lnk--> Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics is dealing with this problem. Recently, the people mustered courage and took to streets in Kabul to protest against gruesome killing of a woman accused of adultery by suspected Taliban in the Parwan province.</p>

       </div>
       <p>Afghanistan is an impoverished and <!--del_lnk--> least developed country, one of the world's poorest due to the decades of war and nearly complete lack of foreign investment. The nation's <a href="../../wp/g/Gross_domestic_product.htm" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a> stands at about $29 billion with an exchange rate of $18 billion, and the <!--del_lnk--> GDP per capita is about $1,000. The country's export was $2.6 billion in 2010. Its unemployment rate is about 35% and roughly the same percentage of its citizens live below the poverty line. About 42% of the population live on less than $1 a day, according to a 2009 report. On the positive side, the nation has less than $1.5 billion <!--del_lnk--> external debt and is recovering by the assistance of the world community.</p>
       <p>The Afghan economy has been growing at about 10% per year in the last decade, which is due to the infusion of over $50 billion dollars in international aid and remittances from Afghan expats. It is also due to improvements made to the <!--del_lnk--> transportation system and agricultural production, which is the backbone of the nation's economy. The country is known for producing some of the finest <!--del_lnk--> pomegranates, grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits, including nuts.</p>
       <p>While the nations's current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations. The <!--del_lnk--> Afghan Ministry of Finance is focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. For example, government revenues increased 31% to $1.7 billion from March 2010 to March 2011.</p>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Da Afghanistan Bank serves as the central bank of the nation and the <!--del_lnk--> "Afghani" (AFN) is the national currency, with an exchange rate of about 47 Afghanis to <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">1 US dollar</a>. Since 2003, over 16 new banks have opened in the country, including <!--del_lnk--> Afghanistan International Bank, <!--del_lnk--> Kabul Bank, <!--del_lnk--> Azizi Bank, <!--del_lnk--> Pashtany Bank, <!--del_lnk--> Standard Chartered Bank, <!--del_lnk--> First Micro Finance Bank, and others.</p>
       <p>One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 5 million <!--del_lnk--> expatriates, who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. For the first time since the 1970s, Afghans have involved themselves in <!--del_lnk--> construction, one of the largest industries in the country. Some of the major national construction projects include the <span class="nowrap">$35 bn</span> <i>New Kabul City</i> next to the capital, the <i>Ghazi Amanullah Khan City</i> near Jalalabad, and the <i>Aino Mena</i> in Kandahar. Similar development projects have also begun in <!--del_lnk--> Herat in the west, <!--del_lnk--> Mazar-e-Sharif in the north and in other cities.</p>
       <p>In addition, a number of companies and small factories began operating in different parts of the country, which not only provide revenues to the government but also create new jobs. Improvements to the business-enabling environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in <a href="../../wp/t/Telecommunication.htm" title="Telecommunication">telecom</a> investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003. The <!--del_lnk--> Afghan rugs are becoming popular again and this gives many <!--del_lnk--> carpet dealers around the country to expand their business by hiring more workers.</p>
       <p>Afghanistan is a member of <!--del_lnk--> SAARC, <!--del_lnk--> ECO and <!--del_lnk--> OIC. It is hoping to join <!--del_lnk--> SCO soon to develop closer economic ties with neighboring and regional countries in the so-called <i><a href="../../wp/s/Silk_Road.htm" title="Silk Road">New Silk Road</a></i> trade project. Foreign Minister <!--del_lnk--> Zalmai Rassoul told the media in 2011 that his nation's "goal is to achieve an Afghan economy whose growth is based on trade, private enterprise and investment". Experts believe that this will revolutionize the economy of the region. <!--del_lnk--> Opium production in Afghanistan soared to a record in 2007 with about 3 million people reported to be involved in the business but then declined significantly in the years following. The government started programs to help reduce cultivation of poppy, and by 2010 it was reported that 24 out of the 34 provinces were free from poppy grow. In June 2012, India strongly advocated for private investments in the resource rich country and creation of suitable environment therefor.</p>
       <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mining_and_energy">Mining and energy</span></h3>
       <p><!--del_lnk--> Michael O'Hanlon of the <!--del_lnk--> Brookings Institution explains that if Afghanistan generates about $10 bn per year from its <!--del_lnk--> mineral deposits, its <!--del_lnk--> gross national product would double and provide long-term funding for Afghan security forces and other critical needs. The <!--del_lnk--> United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2006 that northern Afghanistan has an average <span class="nowrap">2.9 billion (bn) <!--del_lnk--> barrels</span> (bbl) of <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Crude oil">crude oil</a>, 15.7 trillion cubic feet (440 bn m<sup>3</sup>) of <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>, and <span class="nowrap">562 million bbl</span> of <!--del_lnk--> natural gas liquids. In December 2011, Afghanistan signed an oil exploration contract with <!--del_lnk--> China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) for the development of three oil fields along the Amu Darya river in the north.</p>
       <p>Other reports show that the country has huge amounts of <a href="../../wp/l/Lithium.htm" title="Lithium">lithium</a>, copper, gold, coal, iron ore and other <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Minerals">minerals</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Khanashin <!--del_lnk--> carbonatite in <!--del_lnk--> Helmand Province contains 1,000,000 metric tons (1,100,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> short tons) of <!--del_lnk--> rare earth elements. In 2007, a 30-year lease was granted for the <!--del_lnk--> Aynak copper mine to the <!--del_lnk--> China Metallurgical Group for $3 billion, making it the biggest foreign investment and private business venture in Afghanistan's history. The state-run <!--del_lnk--> Steel Authority of India won the mining rights to develop the huge <!--del_lnk--> Hajigak iron ore deposit in central Afghanistan. Government officials estimate that 30% of the country's untapped mineral deposits are worth between <span class="nowrap">$900 bn</span> and <span class="nowrap">$3 trillion</span>. One official asserted that "this will become the backbone of the Afghan economy" and a Pentagon <!--del_lnk--> memo stated that Afghanistan could become the "Saudi Arabia of lithium". In a 2011 news story, the <i><!--del_lnk--> CSM</i> reported, "The United States and other Western nations that have borne the brunt of the cost of the Afghan war have been conspicuously absent from the bidding process on Afghanistan's mineral deposits, leaving it to mostly to regional powers."</p>

As of 2012, vehicles that are older than 10 years are banned from being imported into the country. The development of the nation's road network is a major boost for the economy due to trade with neighboring countries. <!--del_lnk--> Afghanistan's postal and package services such as <!--del_lnk--> FedEx, <!--del_lnk--> DHL and others make deliveries to major cities and towns.</p>

The average <a href="../../wp/l/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy.htm" title="List of countries by life expectancy">life expectancy</a> was estimated in 2012 to be 49.72 years. Afghanistan has the 9th highest <!--del_lnk--> total fertility rate in the world, at 5.64 children born/woman (according to 2012 estimates). Afghanistan has the highest <!--del_lnk--> maternal mortality rate in the world, estimated in 2008 at 1,400 deaths/100,000 live births, and the highest <!--del_lnk--> infant mortality rate in the world (deaths of babies under one year), estimated in 2012 to be 121.63 deaths/1,000 live births. Data from 2010 suggests that one in 10 children in Afghanistan dies before they are five years old. While these statistics are tragic, the government plans to further cut the infant mortality rate to 400 for every 100,000 live births by 2020. The country currently has more than 3,000 <!--del_lnk--> midwives with an additional 300 to 400 being trained each year.</p>
       <p>A number of new hospitals and clinics have been built over the last decade, with the most advanced treatments being available in Kabul. The <!--del_lnk--> French Medical Institute for Children and <!--del_lnk--> Indira Gandhi Childrens Hospital in Kabul are the leading <!--del_lnk--> children's hospitals in the country.

There are also a number of well-equipped military-controlled hospitals in different regions of the country.</p>
       <p>It was reported in 2006 that nearly 60% of the population lives within two hours by foot to the nearest health facility, up from 9% in 2002. Latest surveys show that 57% of Afghans say they have good or very good access to clinics or hospitals. The nation also has one of the highest incidences of people with <!--del_lnk--> disabilities, with an estimated one million handicapped people. About 80,000 citizens have lost limbs, mainly as a result of landmines.

In addition to this, <!--del_lnk--> Baghch-e-Simsim (based on the American <a href="../../wp/s/Sesame_Street.htm" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a>) was launched in late 2011 to help Afghan children learn from <!--del_lnk--> preschool and onward.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Afghan culture has been around for over two millennia, tracing record to at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire in 500 BCE. It is mostly a <!--del_lnk--> nomadic and <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/t/Tribe.htm" title="Tribal society">tribal society</a>, with different regions of the country having their own tradition, reflecting the multi-cultural and multi-lingual character of the nation. In the southern and eastern region the people live according to the <!--del_lnk--> Pashtun culture by following <!--del_lnk--> Pashtunwali, which is an ancient way of life that is still preserved. The remaining of the country is culturally <!--del_lnk--> Persian and <!--del_lnk--> Turkic. Some non-Pashtuns who live in close proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a process called <!--del_lnk--> Pashtunization (or <i>Afghanization</i>) while some Pashtuns have been <!--del_lnk--> Persianized. Millions of Afghans who have been living in Pakistan and Iran over the last 30 years have been influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations.</p>

       <p>Afghans display pride in their culture, nation, ancestry, and above all, their religion and independence. Like other highlanders, they are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honour, for their tribe loyalty and for their readiness to use force to settle disputes. As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. Tony Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle. There are an estimated 60 major <!--del_lnk--> Pashtun tribes, and the Afghan nomads are estimated at about 2&ndash;3 million.</p>
       <p>The nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars. The two famous <!--del_lnk--> Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as <!--del_lnk--> idolatrous. Despite that archaeologists are still finding Buddhist relics in different parts of the country, some of them date back to the 2nd century. This indicates that <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> was widespread in Afghanistan. Other historical places include the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Herat, <!--del_lnk--> Kandahar, <!--del_lnk--> Ghazni, <!--del_lnk--> Mazar-i-Sharif, and <!--del_lnk--> Zarang. The <!--del_lnk--> Minaret of Jam in the <!--del_lnk--> Hari River valley is a <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">UNESCO World Heritage site</a>. A cloak reputedly worn by Islam's Prophet <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> is kept inside the <!--del_lnk--> Shrine of the Cloak in Kandahar, a city founded by <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander</a> and the first capital of Afghanistan. The <!--del_lnk--> citadel of Alexander in the western city of Herat has been renovated in recent years and is a popular attraction for tourists. In the north of the country is the <!--del_lnk--> Shrine of Hazrat Ali, believed by many to be the location where <!--del_lnk--> Ali was buried. The Afghan Ministry of Information and Culture is renovating 42 historic sites in Ghazni until 2013, when the province will be declared as the capital of <!--del_lnk--> Islamic civilization. The <!--del_lnk--> National Museum of Afghanistan is located in Kabul.</p>
       <p>Although literacy level is low, classic <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_literature.htm" title="Persian literature">Persian</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Pashto poetry play an important role in the Afghan culture. <!--del_lnk--> Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Some notable poets include <!--del_lnk--> Rumi, <!--del_lnk--> Rabi'a Balkhi, <!--del_lnk--> Sanai, <!--del_lnk--> Jami, <!--del_lnk--> Khushal Khan Khattak, <!--del_lnk--> Rahman Baba, <!--del_lnk--> Khalilullah Khalili, and <!--del_lnk--> Parween Pazhwak.</p>

       <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Afghanistan national football team has been competing in international <a href="../../wp/a/Association_football.htm" title="Association football">football</a> since 1941 and currently has a world ranking of 179. The national team plays its home games at the <!--del_lnk--> Ghazi Stadium in Kabul, while <!--del_lnk--> football in Afghanistan is governed by the <!--del_lnk--> Afghanistan Football Federation. The national team has never competed or qualified for the World Cup. The country also has a national team in the sport of futsal, a 5-a-side variation of football.</p>
       <p><a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">Cricket</a>, which is a newly introduced <!--del_lnk--> sport in Afghanistan fuelled by the success of the <!--del_lnk--> Afghan national cricket team is growing in popularity. Afghanistan participated in the <!--del_lnk--> 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier, <!--del_lnk--> 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division One, and <!--del_lnk--> 2010 ICC World Twenty20 where they played India and South Africa. It won the <!--del_lnk--> ACC Twenty20 Cup in 2007, 2009, and 2011. More recently the <!--del_lnk--> under-19 team played in the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup. The <!--del_lnk--> Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) is the official governing body of the sport and is headquartered in Kabul. The <!--del_lnk--> Ghazi Amanullah Khan International Cricket Stadium serves as the nation's main cricket stadium, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Kabul National Cricket Stadium. Several other stadiums are under construction. Domestically, cricket is played between teams from different provinces.</p>
       <p>Some of the other popular sports in Afghanistan include <a href="../../wp/b/Basketball.htm" title="Basketball">basketball</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/v/Volleyball.htm" title="Vollyball">vollyball</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Taekwondo.htm" title="Taekwondo">taekwondo</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> bodybuilding. <!--del_lnk--> Buzkashi is a traditional sport, mainly among the northern Afghans. It is similar to <!--del_lnk--> polo, played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a goat carcass. <!--del_lnk--> Afghan Hounds (a type of running dog) originated in Afghanistan and was originally used in the sport of hunting.</p>
