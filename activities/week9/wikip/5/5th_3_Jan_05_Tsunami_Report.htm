<h1>Tsunami Emergency Relief <br /></h1>
5th report (3 Jan 2005)<br /><br /><br />
<p>We
have enough <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sponsor_A_Child_A.htm">child&nbsp; sponsors </a>for tsunami orphans. Please <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sponsor_Africa.htm">sponsor an African
AIDS orphan</a> instead.</p>
<p><img class="image-left image-inline" src="../../wp/i/_BGQImage_preview" alt="Child drawing just after tsunami" />On 26th December, a massive underwater earthquake
sent devastating giant waves into coastlines across the Indian Ocean.
Such earthquakes suddenly change the height of the sea floor by up to
several metres and as a result hundreds of miles of ocean can find
itself above sea level. As a result the water stranded too high pours
faster and faster into the surrounding sea giving massive wave flow
called tsunami or tidal waves which have many miles of water in
thickness and travel very fast.</p>
<p> As of today (3 Jan 2005), it
is estimated that 150,000 lives have been lost to the massive tsunami
and many more victims are still unaccounted for.</p>
<p>All 48 SOS
Children&#x2019;s Communities in <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/i/India_A.htm">India,</a> <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka_A.htm">Sri Lanka</a>, <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/t/Thailand_A.htm">Thailand</a> and <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/i/Indonesia_B.htm">Indonesia</a>, are
thankfully all undamaged; some by incredible chance - but we have
infrastructure and people there on the ground and obviously will play a
central role in helping people especially children around us. We are
launching this emergency appeal for funds to help us help the local
devasted population. SOS Children has been working in South East Asia
since 1963. In a region where there are 42,840,000 recorded orphans the
impact of the tsunami on an already vulnerable population is
unimaginable.</p>
<p>Teams of relief workers from SOS Children in
India and Sri Lanka are on the ground in badly-hit areas to assess the
need and to co-ordinate relief operations. They are working on India&#x2019;s
and Sri Lanka&#x2019;s East coast where thousands - among them many children -
have been left dead, thousands are missing and possibly millions have
become homeless.</p>
<h2>SOS Children in India</h2>
<br />
<p>See
<a class="external-link" href="../../wp/i/India_A.htm">SOS in India</a> for background to our India operations. SOS Children&#x2019;s
teams of relief workers are organising the setting up of 16 <a title="SOS Emergency Relief Appeals" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/e/Emergency_Appeal.htm">emergency
relief camps</a> in the South of India. According to our head of
operations, Victor Painadath, there are 30,000 children in the region
in urgent need of help.</p>
<p>This is how Victor describes the disaster situation in the town Nagappattinam:</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s
been 48 hours now since the tsunami (tidal wave) hit this town. The
roads are full of mud and dirt as the sea water has recessed. There is
debris of broken walls, boats, shoes and other debris. The place has
the pungent smell of dead bodies. The main activity here is cleaning up
the whole place. Shops are closed and life is at a stand still. We saw
a hundred people running, shouting that the waters are coming again. I
saw women crying out in panic, trembling children running to their
mothers. There was nothing there, except someone having watched high
waves hitting the shores. I explain this to you to show you that people
here are living in terrible fear.&#x201D; Victor Painadath, Head of
Operations, <a title="Emergency Relief Archive: look back at the Asian Tsunami" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/2/2004_Asian_Tsunami.htm">Tsunami Emergency Relief Programme</a>, India.</p>
<p><img class="image-right image-inline" src="../../wp/i/_BGPImage_preview" alt="SOS post tsunami centre in India" />In the
towns of Velakanni, Nagappattinam and Kanykumari and neighbouring
communities, between 3,000 and 4,000 children will be provided with
food, clothes and medical care; through daily games and activities,
they will have the opportunity to process the traumatic experiences of
loss, being scared and witnessing destruction.</p>
<p>The temples in
these towns have provided vulnerable families with a place of refuge
and <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Soschildren.htm">SOS Children</a> will set up camps inside the temple buildings and in
the grounds of the temples to provide these families with food, clean
drinking water, clothes and medication.</p>
<p>In the fishing village
of Cuddalore in the Pondicherry province, hundreds of men who were out
fishing when the tsunami struck have not returned. The families in this
small village have lost everything - their houses, their boats and
fishing nets, their livelihoods. SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages is currently
establishing temporary shelters for these families.</p>
<p>The coming
weeks will tell how many children have lost their parents and relatives
in the disaster and therefore how many will need long term care in SOS
Children&#x2019;s Villages.</p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka_A.htm">SOS Children in Sri Lanka</a><br />The main task
of the aid and emergency work in Sri Lanka is to provide assistance to
the hard hit disaster areas on the south coast. At the same time - many
of the worst hit communities in East Sri Lanka cannot be reached as
some areas are still under the control of the LTTE (Liberation Tigers
of Talim Eelam).</p>
<p>Yesterday SOS Children was successful in
delivering our first batch of relief supplies for 3,000 children to the
<a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Srilanka_B.htm">SOS Social Centre Batticaloa</a> on the east coast.</p>
<p>Many of the
people hit by the tsunami disaster were made homeless just a month ago
by the November flood disaster. Entire families have now been lost. The
buildings of the SOS Children Social Centre in Batticaloa on the east
coast are now <a title="SOS Emergency Relief Appeals" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/e/Emergency_Appeal.htm">emergency shelters</a> for people who have survived but who
have lost everything. A lorry loaded with relief packages for 3,000
homeless children arrived yesterday with clean drinking water, food,
dairy products for small children, candles, matches and clothes.</p>
<p>SOS Children is already planning ways to work with the community in the long term to help rebuild their livelihoods.</p>
<p>In
Piliyandala where the first SOS Children&#x2019;s Village was built in Sri
Lanka, more than 500 families have found refuge in the main temple
compound near the capital city of Colombo. SOS Children is organising
medical care and food for these families in co-operation with temple
authorities.</p>
