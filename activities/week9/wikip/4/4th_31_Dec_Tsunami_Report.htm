<h2>REPORT ON THE INITIAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO REFUGEES IN THE BATTICALOA DISTRICT IN THE <a title="Emergency Relief Archive: look back at the Asian Tsunami" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/2/2004_Asian_Tsunami.htm">AFTERMATH OF THE TSUNAMI</a></h2>
<p>SOS
Children&#x2019;s Villages of <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka_A.htm">Sri Lanka</a> (in consultation with SOS-KDI) took
immediate action to provide relief to the refugees in Batticaloa and
areas north of that as a first step in providing aid to those affected
by the Tsunami. Having made contact with Fr. Crispus who runs the SOS
Social Centre Batticaloa in Morakkatanchenai, and establishing the
immediate requirements, a truckload of dry-rations consisting of rice,
dhal, sugar, tea, milk powder, and chillie-powder, as well as
feeding-bottles and nipples, bottled water, salt, candles, match boxes
and medicines.</p>
<p>All materials were purchased and 3,000 packages
were made with the help of SOS staff and volunteers at the <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Srilanka_A.htm">SOS
Social Centre in Nuwara Eliya</a>, which is being used as a collection and
co-ordination centre for the eastern and southeastern coastal areas.
The value of the goods amounted to approximately Rs.400, 000.00. The
SOS staff and neighbours of the SOS Children&#x2019;s Village, Nuwara
Eliya, donated the clothes. Of the total value of the load, materials
worth approximately Rs.110,000.00 were donated by concerned citizens
and friends of SOS, Nuwara Eliya, as was the truck used to transport
the relief. The SOS Children's van with some co-workers accompanied the
lorry, on December 28, 2004. Two journalists and two volunteer helpers,
who joined the refugee-assistance team, accompanied them.</p>
<p>On
reaching Morakkatanchenai, Fr. Crispus joined the team to visit
Vakarai, a small village just south of designated un-cleared areas
under the control of the LTTE. The SOS Refugee Assistance team was the
first to visit this village, considered to be a high-risk area due to
the active pressure mines that had surfaced due to the effect of the
waves. However, the team was confident and reached the area without
incident. Around 225 families that had been displaced were taking
refugee at the Alankulam Tamil Vidyalayam (school). The number of
refugees was increasing steadily, as the affected families were pouring
in to this refugee camp, having no alternative centre to go to. All the
inhabitants of this camp were provided with dry rations and clothes.
The dry rations that were provided were sufficient to last for the next
two days. The SOS team was followed by another NGO, ZOA, who also
handed out relief. There was no sign of any government assistance at
any of the camps visited.</p>
<p>Karuvankerni was the next village to
be visited where 150 families were taking shelter at the Vigneshwaran
Maha Vidyalayam (school), where the numbers were increasing steadily.
Here too items sufficient for two days were distributed.</p>
<p>Pudukudiruppu
Tamil Maha Vidyalayam (school) was the next centre to be visited, where
425 families were taking refuge. This was one of the largest camps and
here too the numbers were increasing so rapidly that on completion of
distributing our items there were 555 families- an increase of 125
families in the matter of a few hours.</p>
<p>The&#x2019; Relief-team&#x2019; spent
the night at the <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Medical_Centres.htm">SOS Social centre</a> at Morakkatanchenai and on the
following morning visited the Eastern University, Batticaloa, where
over one thousand families were camped. However, these refugees had
received sufficient rations as this camp is situated by the main road
of Batticaloa and was easily accessed by local agencies. The final
distribution took place at the Vandaramulla, Vishnu Vidyalayam, where
two hundred and fifteen families and about two hundred children were
sheltered. Here too food items sufficient for two days were
distributed. Most of the feeding bottles were distributed at this camp
due to the large numbers of infants.</p>
<p>A small stock of food
items were retained at the SOS Centre, Morakkatanchenai. This Centre is
providing cooked meals as immediate relief to recently arriving
refugees. This effort had begun with the help of the Anglican Church
and some donors even before the SOS team reached the area.</p>
<p>All
the refugees in Alankulam Tamil Vidyalayam, Karuvankerni Vigneshwaran
Maha Vidyalayam and Pudukudiruppu Tamil Maha Vidyalayam are from
Vakarai, which is a small fishing village about twenty-five kilometers
from the SOS Social Centre at Morakkatanchenai. Five thousand four
hundred and eighty families were living in Vakarai and all of them have
been affected by the Tsunami.</p>
<p>STATISTICS</p>
<p>The statistics
published through the state are not at all accurate as our observations
revealed that the numbers of refugees have not been recorded in any of
the camps we visited. According to some of the refugees we spoke to,
they have lost their kith and kin but none of this has been recorded by
the state. At present more than forty makeshift camps are functioning
in the Batticaloa district.</p>
<p>OBSERVATIONS</p>
<p>We observed
that none of these camps have sufficient water or sanitary facilities.
&#x2022; There are no systematic procedures to record the losses of these
refugees. &#x2022; Hygienic conditions are virtually non-existent or in a very
poor state. &#x2022; The refugees need kitchen utensils, medicines, toilet
accessories, ladies underwear, sanitary napkins, mats, bed sheets, etc.</p>
<p>&#x2022; During the interviews it was revealed that the refugees are
not sure whether they want to return to where they came from, as they
are scared that they might be subject to another tidal wave and also
due to the fact that they have lost their dwellings and possessions.</p>
<p>&#x2022;
They were not in a proper state of mind to decide what they should do.
However, some indicated that they are fishermen and they would like to
get back to their regular profession but needed a roof over their heads
and the required fishing gear. &#x2022;</p>
<p>PROPOSALS</p>
<p>1. To send
more essential items to other affected areas after making assessment of
the most essential requirements, as at present there are numerous
NGO&#x2019;s, Social Workers, Government Institutions, Private Organizations
and private individuals visiting the affected areas and donating
various materials.</p>
<p>2. To convert the SOS Social Centre at Morakkatanchenai to a temporary refugee camp for up to one hundred and fifty families.</p>
<p>3.
To establish a camp in Monaragala for orphaned and displaced children
and for single parents with children until re-unification, placements
and rehabilitation is completed. 4. To establish a re-building
programme for the affected families after establishing needs. Divakar
